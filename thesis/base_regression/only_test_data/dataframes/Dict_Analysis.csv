Daily Caller,"Journalists were quick to take to Twitter and the airwaves as soon as President Donald Trump’s primetime plea for a border wall was broadcast Tuesday evening.
Trump discussed public safety, economic and illicit drug issues he said stem from illegal immigration as the partial government shutdown triggered by his push for border wall funding hit Day 18.
Members of the media reacted almost immediately.
“I see the president’s face but I hear Stephen Miller’s voice,” tweeted Maggie Haberman of OutletName, referring to Trump’s senior policy advisor who has defended shutting down the government for border security. “How is this a call for bipartisanship?” she added.
Other journalists appeared in network fact checks between Trump’s address and Democrats’ rebuttal.
“Just because you say it’s a crisis doesn’t necessarily make it one,” Cecilia Vega of OutletName said, referencing Trump’s characterization of the issue as a “crisis at our southern border.”
Others called Trump racist.
“Sickening to hear Trump try to bait the Latino and Black communities with false, racist trope about immigrants taking jobs,” tweeted OutletName political commentator Karen Finney. “If he really cared about people of color in the U.S. he would stop his nativist agenda and would’ve easily denounced the KKK in Charlottesville for starters.”
“Why is Trump asking for more money for his wall now that Democrats control the U.S. House than he did when the Republicans controlled everything? He needs to create a fight to distract from Muller Muller Muller Muller,” Finney later tweeted.
Washington Post media reporter Erik Wemple found Trump’s address to be more of the same.
“Looks like the White House secured major network TV time for an address that repeats all of the president’s arguments on immigration, only, this time, through a TelePrompTer,” Wemple wrote on Twitter.","journalists were quick to take to twitter and the airwaves as soon as president donald trump ’ s primetime plea for a border wall was broadcast tuesday evening. trump discussed public safety, economic and illicit drug issues he said stem from illegal immigration as the partial government shutdown triggered by his push for border wall funding hit day 18. members of the media reacted almost immediately. “ i see the president ’ s face but i hear stephen miller ’ s voice, ” tweeted maggie haberman of outletname, referring to trump ’ s senior policy advisor who has defended shutting down the government for border security. “ how is this a call for bipartisanship? ” she added. other journalists appeared in network fact checks between trump ’ s address and democrats ’ rebuttal. “ just because you say it ’ s a crisis doesn ’ t necessarily make it one, ” cecilia vega of outletname said, referencing trump ’ s characterization of the issue as a “ crisis at our southern border. ” others called trump racist. “ sickening to hear trump try to bait the latino and black communities with false, racist trope about immigrants taking jobs, ” tweeted outletname political commentator karen finney. “ if he really cared about people of color in the u. s. he would stop his nativist agenda and would ’ ve easily denounced the kkk in charlottesville for starters. ” “ why is trump asking for more money for his wall now that democrats control the u. s. house than he did when the republicans controlled everything? he needs to create a fight to distract from muller muller muller muller, ” finney later tweeted. washington post media reporter erik wemple found trump ’ s address to be more of the same. “ looks like the white house secured major network tv time for an address that repeats all of the president ’ s arguments on immigration, only, this time, through a teleprompter, ” wemple wrote on twitter.",0.0001084293544408,0.499891519546508,0,306,0.65,1.96,4.9,0.98,0.65,3.27,7.84,0.65,2.61,1.31,0.65,0.65,1.96,0.0,0.65,0.0,0.33,0.0,13.73,0.0,0.0,0.33,2.61,0.33,0.65,1.96,0.98,0.0,0.65,0.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.63,7.52,0.33,4.58,1.63,0.65,0.0,4.58,4.9,1.96,0.33,5.88235294117647,5.88235294117647,1.6339869281045754
NYTimes,"In June, Josue, a 21-year-old Honduran, reached a safe house in the Mexican border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas. He was there with 11 other Central American migrants. His family had spent the previous year scraping together the $3,800 necessary for this last part of his journey to the United States. But the “safe” house was not so safe. Only miles from the border, his migration was interrupted as armed men burst into the house, kidnapping the migrants and demanding an additional $1,800 for their release. If their families couldn’t raise the money, the armed men warned, the migrants would be killed. Every day, dramas and tragedies like this play out for the Honduran, Salvadoran and Guatemalan migrants traveling through Mexico. The Trump administration’s rhetoric has repeatedly linked migrants to gangs, violence and crime, and cast undocumented immigrants as a threat to public safety. But in fact, a majority of the Central Americans arriving at the United States-Mexico border are not perpetrators but rather victims of violence, both in their home countries and during their fraught transit through Mexico. Over the past three decades, the risks and dangers on the journey from Central America to the United States border have increased — ramped-up United States and Mexican migratory enforcement has pushed migrants onto more invisible, risky paths, and impunity in Mexico for criminal perpetrators has kept them on the streets. Yet however daunting the risks and challenging the policies, they have not significantly put a dent in the number of Central Americans traveling north. What has changed is that hundreds of thousands of migrants make the journey to the United States along more clandestine and treacherous routes. For Central American migrants, there is no single transportation method or route to travel through Mexico to reach the United States. Travel experiences are influenced by a migrant’s nationality, gender, age and income. If a Central American migrant hires a smuggler for transiting through Mexico — and 60 percent report hiring these guides in surveys conducted by the Colegio de la Frontera Norte — then the routes will also be determined by the smugglers’ contacts and methods. But they all have at least one thing in common: Not one is safe, and each comes with a series of risks. As soon as migrants near Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala, the dangers begin. To reach Mexico’s southernmost cities, migrants with a bit of money can take local buses or hire taxis. Those with empty wallets must walk. This may include hiking for days on the sides of highways, often at night to avoid detection and the strong tropical sun. Mexican officials have focused their enforcement attention less at the physical border and more at highway checkpoints set up around 30 or 100 miles into Mexican territory, where migration authorities attempt to identify individuals transiting through the country without the appropriate documents. Great Distances and Dangers
Migrants fleeing violence in Central America may travel distances equivalent to that between Chicago and Miami (about 1,400 miles) or Chicago and the West Coast (more than 2,000 miles). Many are subject to crime along the way. The map shows some of the most-traveled routes. In these desolate areas in the south of Mexico, migrants may be set upon by criminals like corrupt authorities, opportunistic local groups and members of the gangs MS-13 or Barrio 18 — the very groups that migrants may be fleeing and who have a presence in this part of Mexico. That was the case for Josue, who was robbed by local criminals as he hiked the 40-mile stretch of remote highway between a Guatemala border city, El Ceibo, and Tenosique, a southern Mexican city. The thieves slipped out of the nearby ranch land and stripped him of his possessions, even taking his sneakers and leaving him with one of the robbers’ decrepit, fungus-covered pair. According to prosecutors in the southernmost states of Chiapas and Tabasco, these robberies and assaults are fairly common. Women are also singled out for other forms of violence, with Doctors Without Borders reporting that one-third of female migrants suffer sexual abuse while in Mexico. To advance north, the poorest Central Americans climb aboard Mexico’s train cars (nicknamed “La Bestia,” or the Beast) and ride exposed through rain, heat and frigid wind, and with the constant fear of slipping off the sides. They also travel on high alert for the gang members or train security guards who sometimes board the trains to extort or rob the riders. Given these extreme risks — along with Mexican officials’ 2014 crackdown on migrants riding the train through the Southern Border Plan (Programa Frontera Sur) — only 12 percent of Central American migrants in 2017 reported to Colegio de la Frontera Norte researchers that they had taken the trains at any point in their journey. Migrants with a little more money use private cars, buses or trailers and move along Mexico’s major north-south highways; they pass through the Mexican migration checkpoints by passing as locals or paying off corrupt officials. Some avoid the checkpoints altogether and hike around them. Traveling in vehicles is generally safer for migrants, but there may still be hardships from the varying quality of food, abysmal sleeping arrangements or mistreatment from their guides or fellow migrants. At the United States border, patrol agents and a range of radars, sensors and other technology seek to block the migrants’ irregular crossing into the United States. In response, some Central Americans may attempt to cross in the remote areas in the vast California or Arizona deserts or near the border city of Ciudad Juárez. Others ask for asylum at ports of entry. But most travel up Mexico’s Gulf Coast to reach Reynosa, Tamaulipas. This city shares a border with McAllen, Tex., within the southern Rio Grande Valley. In fiscal 2017, the United States Border Patrol reported that it apprehended two-thirds of all irregular Central American migrants (104,305 in total) in this 320-mile section of the border. On the Mexico side of the border near Reynosa, drug trafficking organizations, particularly the Gulf Cartel and the splinter groups of the Zetas, control the territory and the smuggling routes and act as unofficial tax agents. These groups offer the Central American migrants’ final security challenge and engage in their signature crime, kidnapping. Their presence gives this area the nefarious distinction of having the highest number of migrant kidnappings. Since 2011, data from Mexico’s National Migration Institute has documented 1,034 kidnapping victims in Tamaulipas — 75 percent of all migrant kidnapping victims in the country. Women and minors each account for more than a quarter of the victims. But official numbers barely scratch the surface of the crimes committed against migrants in Mexico. Central Americans rarely report the crimes to Mexican authorities because of a lack of trust, fear of repercussions or limited knowledge of the country’s justice system. Josue is a good example. He was able to escape his captors after the Federal Police intercepted a car that was taking him to a second safe house, but he decided not to report the kidnapping given concerns over his safety. When migrants do report these crimes, few are ever investigated or prosecuted. In July 2017, the Washington Office on Latin America reported that only 1 percent of crimes against migrants in Mexico ever reach a conviction. What could push people to knowingly face these conditions or, worse, to bring their children along? For Central Americans, there is a deep chasm between migrants’ desires for safety, work and family reunification and their ability to fulfill these dreams within their own countries or legally in the United States. In Reynosa, Josue was gearing up to try to make the hike from the border to Houston. Along with hundreds of thousands of other Central American migrants taking these same routes and escaping violence at home or in transit, he was confident that the journey would be worth it. The hope of a better and safer life in the United States was stronger than the fear of any dangers along the way.","in june, josue, a 21 - year - old honduran, reached a safe house in the mexican border city of reynosa, tamaulipas. he was there with 11 other central american migrants. his family had spent the previous year scraping together the $ 3, 800 necessary for this last part of his journey to the united states. but the “ safe ” house was not so safe. only miles from the border, his migration was interrupted as armed men burst into the house, kidnapping the migrants and demanding an additional $ 1, 800 for their release. if their families couldn ’ t raise the money, the armed men warned, the migrants would be killed. every day, dramas and tragedies like this play out for the honduran, salvadoran and guatemalan migrants traveling through mexico. the trump administration ’ s rhetoric has repeatedly linked migrants to gangs, violence and crime, and cast undocumented immigrants as a threat to public safety. but in fact, a majority of the central americans arriving at the united states - mexico border are not perpetrators but rather victims of violence, both in their home countries and during their fraught transit through mexico. over the past three decades, the risks and dangers on the journey from central america to the united states border have increased — ramped - up united states and mexican migratory enforcement has pushed migrants onto more invisible, risky paths, and impunity in mexico for criminal perpetrators has kept them on the streets. yet however daunting the risks and challenging the policies, they have not significantly put a dent in the number of central americans traveling north. what has changed is that hundreds of thousands of migrants make the journey to the united states along more clandestine and treacherous routes. for central american migrants, there is no single transportation method or route to travel through mexico to reach the united states. travel experiences are influenced by a migrant ’ s nationality, gender, age and income. if a central american migrant hires a smuggler for transiting through mexico — and 60 percent report hiring these guides in surveys conducted by the colegio de la frontera norte — then the routes will also be determined by the smugglers ’ contacts and methods. but they all have at least one thing in common : not one is safe, and each comes with a series of risks. as soon as migrants near mexico ’ s southern border with guatemala, the dangers begin. to reach mexico ’ s southernmost cities, migrants with a bit of money can take local buses or hire taxis. those with empty wallets must",0.999976515769958,0.499976555001922,1,419,2.86,6.44,3.1,0.95,0.24,1.91,6.68,0.24,0.72,0.95,1.43,0.48,3.58,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.24,6.68,0.48,0.0,0.0,1.43,0.24,0.95,1.43,0.95,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.0,3.34,12.89,3.58,9.79,0.24,0.0,0.0,4.06,3.1,2.63,0.48,5.4892601431980905,9.785202863961814,2.386634844868735
HuffPost,"A Massachusetts county sheriff has proposed sending prison inmates from around the United States to build the proposed wall along the Mexican border that is one of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s most prominent campaign promises.
“I can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our country than building this wall,” Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said at his swearing-in ceremony for a fourth term in office late Wednesday.
“Aside from learning and perfecting construction skills, the symbolism of these inmates building a wall to prevent crime in communities around the country, and to preserve jobs and work opportunities for them and other Americans upon release, can be very powerful,” he said.
Hodgson, who like Trump is a Republican, said inmates from around the country could build the proposed wall, described by Trump as a powerful deterrent to illegal immigration.
Trump, who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, insisted during his campaign that he would convince the Mexican government to pay for the wall, though Mexican officials have repeatedly said they would not do so.
Officials in the Trump transition office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The United States has a long history of prison labor, with advocates of the idea saying that putting inmates to work can help them learn skills that prepare them for their return to society after completing their sentences. Opponents contend that inmates are not fairly compensated.
The federal prisons system operates some 53 factories around the United States that produced about $500 million worth of clothing, electronics, furniture and other goods in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, according to its financial statements.
Still, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts said Hodgson’s proposal could violate prisoners’ rights.
“The proposal is perverse, it’s inhumane and very likely unconstitutional,” ACLU staff counsel Laura Rotolo said in a phone interview. “It certainly has nothing to do with helping prisoners in Massachusetts or their families. It’s about politics.”
In response to a request by the Trump transition office, the Department of Homeland Security last month identified more than 400 miles (644 km) along the U.S.-Mexico border where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by OutletName.
The document contained an estimate that building that section of fence would cost more than $11 billion.","a massachusetts county sheriff has proposed sending prison inmates from around the united states to build the proposed wall along the mexican border that is one of u. s. president - elect donald trump ’ s most prominent campaign promises. “ i can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our country than building this wall, ” bristol county sheriff thomas hodgson said at his swearing - in ceremony for a fourth term in office late wednesday. “ aside from learning and perfecting construction skills, the symbolism of these inmates building a wall to prevent crime in communities around the country, and to preserve jobs and work opportunities for them and other americans upon release, can be very powerful, ” he said. hodgson, who like trump is a republican, said inmates from around the country could build the proposed wall, described by trump as a powerful deterrent to illegal immigration. trump, who will be sworn in on jan. 20, insisted during his campaign that he would convince the mexican government to pay for the wall, though mexican officials have repeatedly said they would not do so. officials in the trump transition office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the united states has a long history of prison labor, with advocates of the idea saying that putting inmates to work can help them learn skills that prepare them for their return to society after completing their sentences. opponents contend that inmates are not fairly compensated. the federal prisons system operates some 53 factories around the united states that produced about $ 500 million worth of clothing, electronics, furniture and other goods in the fiscal year ended sept. 30, according to its financial statements. still, an attorney for the american civil liberties union in massachusetts said hodgson ’ s proposal could violate prisoners ’ rights. “ the proposal is perverse, it ’ s inhumane and very likely unconstitutional, ” aclu staff counsel laura rotolo said in a phone interview. “ it certainly has nothing to do with helping prisoners in massachusetts or their families. it ’ s about politics. ” in response to a request by the trump transition office, the department of homeland security last month identified more than 400 miles ( 644 km ) along the u. s. - mexico border where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by outletname. the document contained an estimate that building that section of fence would cost more than $ 11 billion.",0.999960660934448,0.49996071383066,1,404,2.72,4.46,10.15,1.73,1.73,6.93,9.16,1.49,0.99,2.48,0.99,0.5,2.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.59,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.99,0.0,0.25,4.46,1.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.25,8.66,0.5,8.17,0.25,0.0,0.0,3.22,2.72,2.72,1.73,5.693069306930694,8.16831683168317,0.9900990099009901
FoxNews,"We’ve got a question for all these people claiming the crisis on the border is “fake.” Can’t you see the proof right before your own eyes?
President Trump laid the sad truth about the emergency on our unsecured southern border in his Oval Office address last week. Ever since the fake news media have been trying to convince us that everything is just fine.
MSOutletName’s Joe Scarborough called all of us “stupid” for believing there’s any crisis at all. Politico even tried to use a “fact-check” to tell us there’s no crisis. It’s obvious where they’re getting this nonsense from: Democrats, whose talking points they’re just disguising as “news” and “fact-checks.”
TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON BORDER WALL, AS POLLS SHOW VOTERS TURNING AGAINST HIS SHUTDOWN STRATEGY
The problem for them is that both Democrats and the media had no problem calling the border situation a “crisis” back when Barack Obama was president. In 2014, Obama himself used the term “crisis” to describe the wave of so-called unaccompanied minors. The same outlets that call us “stupid” for believing that the border is in crisis had no problem using the exact same term just five years ago. Even hyper-liberal Wikipedia still refers to the 2014 episode as an “American Immigration Crisis.”
Well, guess what? We’re back up to the same number of apprehensions that all these liberals agreed was a crisis back in 2014. In fact, the emergency is even worse now than it was back then.
Waves of children facing unimaginable dangers while trying to illegally cross the border on their own, like we saw in 2014, was bad enough. Now we keep facing organized “caravans” made up of thousands of migrants determined to breach our unsecured border and attack our Border Patrol agents.
Worse still, we have adults trying to take advantage of “catch and release” policies by using innocent children -- many of them unrelated minors kidnapped just for this purpose -- to take advantage of policies that give preferential treatment to illegal immigrants who travel as “families.”
You bet this is a crisis! It’s a crisis that’s been going on for years and years. It gets bigger and bigger, but only in the eyes of Democrats and the liberal media did it stop existing as a crisis once Donald Trump became president.
As President Trump pointed out in his Oval Office address, it’s Black Americans in particular who bear the brunt of this crisis. It’s those communities in particular that get flooded with the drugs and crime that surge across America’s unprotected southern border.
While rich people and big businesses reap the benefits of the influx of cheap labor from Mexico and Central America, it’s the African American community, black people, that pay the most for illegal immigration in the form of lost jobs and lower wages.
One study by economists from Harvard, the University of Chicago, and the University of California, San Diego found that immigration has had a more devastating effect on employment and wages for African-American men than the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 90s, resulting in thousands more black men going to prison instead of into the workforce.
We’d love to see a liberal journalist explain how crack wasn’t a “crisis” for Black America back then. That makes about as much sense as saying uncontrolled illegal immigration isn’t one.
All of these two-faced denials from the media serve just one purpose: to turn people against President Trump and undermine popular support for real border security.
You can bet Donald Trump takes the situation seriously enough that he’ll declare it a national emergency if Democrats keep refusing to acknowledge the reality of the crisis facing the American people. The Democrats and their media allies are convinced that if they just pretend there’s no crisis at all, they can stop the president from using his emergency authority, but they’re wrong.
You probably won’t hear it from the fake news media, but we’re actually living under 31 other national emergencies at this very moment, many of which were originally declared by Democratic presidents. Do liberals really expect us to believe that the violence, crime, drugs and economic suffering caused by rampant illegal immigration isn’t the 32nd crisis facing our country?
The American people aren’t blind, and when we look at the mess on our southern border, we see it for what it is: a crisis. You know Democrats think we’re too stupid to know all this. They think they can tell us everything is just fine on the border and we won’t educate ourselves on the truth. Well, they can’t play that game anymore.

CNN,"President Donald Trump won the White House in 2016 due, in large part, to his willingness to play on deep-seated fear of the other. “They” were invading America,Trump argued. “They” were challenging “our” values, changing the face of America in ways that were deeply damaging to the country. In ways large and small, Trump has continued to blow the dog whistle as President – insisting that on everything from immigration to trade, America is under very serious threat from the “other,” and that unless things change, we will lose what is fundamentally American. Trump took that call up a level on Monday morning, with two tweets that aimed to not only draw a very bright line between “us” and “them” but also to raise the stakes of that made-up fight. Here are Trump’s tweets from this morning strung together (bold is mine): “Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large ‘Caravans’ of people enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws. Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don’t allow them to do their job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!” Let’s parse what Trump is saying and doing here. First off, the “caravans” mentioned here by Trump refer to, presumably, the group of more than 1,000 people currently making their way through Mexico on their way to the US where they are seeking asylum. It’s the fifth time that the group People Without Borders has led such a caravan of people – who say they are fleeing persecution in their own countries. In 2017, there were two so-called caravans of 200 or so people; of that group, three have been granted asylum in the US while the others’ fates are still being litigated. So, unlike some (many?) of the things Trump tweets, there’s truth here. But, what Trump is doing here has very little to do with the actual reality of these asylum seekers. After all, it’s a relatively small group. And it’s not the first time this has happened. What Trump is doing is using the caravan to play on the fears of the country – and, in particular, his supporters. The mental image he is conjuring is something out of “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome”: Hordes of ill-intentioned people surging toward the US with malice in their minds. They want to take what’s ours, Trump is basically screaming. And they will if we don’t stop them! Whether or not Trump actually believes this (and I’m not sure he does), he absolutely knows what he is doing with this sort of language. This is the same sentiment that animates the “Make America Great Again” slogan of Trump’s campaign and rhetoric like this from his inauguration speech: “Crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.” The surface-level message of all of that goes like this: This country was made great by people like you and I. We shared a value system. We built all that you love about the country. But, these people don’t think like us. They won’t make America great. And I am the one willing to stand up for you and our values. The just-below-the-surface message is this: White people made this country great. Brown people are flooding in. They pose an existential threat to your daily life and what the future holds for your children. If you don’t fight back now, you may lose everything. Another example of this came in January, when Trump spoke of countries from which he’d like to see more immigration. He mentioned predominantly-white Norway and not “shithole countries” like those in Africa. The comments blew up a bipartisan effort to pass legislation to give special legal status to people in the DACA program. Appeals like these – raw, emotional and designed to be a punch in the gut – work in politics. Hope and change may be powerful motivators but they are nothing compared to fear and anxiety. Trump’s 2016 campaign is a testament to just how powerful making people scared can be. Despite large majorities of people believing he was not temperamentally suited to be President and lacked the qualifications for the job, they voted for him anyway – believing that we are under threat and that only Trump properly understood it. As Trump feels more and more free to act in ways consistent with his gut – and as Republicans continue to fret about the gap in base enthusiasm between their side and Democrats heading into the midterms this November – all of this seems purposeful. There’s no question that talk of invading hordes of immigrants rallies the Trump base. Ditto calls for the need for a wall. “DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon,” tweeted Trump on Monday. “No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!” Trump knows what he is doing here. Look for a relentless focus on the wall and the threats posed by allegedly unfettered immigration between now and November. And it will likely gin up the GOP base. That won’t mean Republicans can dodge the likely hit they will take. But, it might mitigate it slightly. But that doesn’t make what he’s doing presidential. Or right.","president donald trump won the white house in 2016 due, in large part, to his willingness to play on deep - seated fear of the other. “ they ” were invading america, trump argued. “ they ” were challenging “ our ” values, changing the face of america in ways that were deeply damaging to the country. in ways large and small, trump has continued to blow the dog whistle as president – insisting that on everything from immigration to trade, america is under very serious threat from the “ other, ” and that unless things change, we will lose what is fundamentally american. trump took that call up a level on monday morning, with two tweets that aimed to not only draw a very bright line between “ us ” and “ them ” but also to raise the stakes of that made - up fight. here are trump ’ s tweets from this morning strung together ( bold is mine ) : “ mexico has the absolute power not to let these large ‘ caravans ’ of people enter their country. they must stop them at their northern border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws. congress must immediately pass border legislation, use nuclear option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people. border patrol agents ( and ice ) are great, but the weak dem laws don ’ t allow them to do their job. act now congress, our country is being stolen! ” let ’ s parse what trump is saying and doing here. first off, the “ caravans ” mentioned here by trump refer to, presumably, the group of more than 1, 000 people currently making their way through mexico on their way to the us where they are seeking asylum. it ’ s the fifth time that the group people without borders has led such a caravan of people – who say they are fleeing persecution in their own countries. in 2017, there were two so - called caravans of 200 or so people ; of that group, three have been granted asylum in the us while the others ’ fates are still being litigated. so, unlike some ( many? ) of the things trump tweets, there ’ s truth here. but, what trump is doing here has very little to do with the actual reality of these asylum seekers. after all, it ’ s a relatively small group. and it ’ s not the first time this has happened. what trump is doing is using the caravan to play on the fears of the country",0.999972224235534,0.499972192686982,1,413,2.66,4.6,7.02,1.45,1.45,4.12,8.96,0.24,2.42,0.73,0.73,0.0,5.08,0.0,0.73,0.48,0.24,0.0,14.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.48,0.24,1.45,0.24,0.0,0.73,0.48,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.73,11.62,1.21,9.2,0.48,0.24,0.0,3.87,3.39,5.33,0.48,4.358353510895883,12.590799031477,0.7263922518159807
Breitbart,"Angel Mom Mary Ann Mendoza says Americans who have been victimized by illegal aliens are living proof that United States needs a wall along the southern border to stop illegal immigration.
On Friday, President Trump announced he would reopen the federal government by signing a three-week funding bill that does not include money for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Mendoza — who co-founded Angel Families after her 32-year-old son Brandon Mendoza was killed by a drunk illegal alien who was driving the wrong way down a highway in Mesa, Arizona — told OutletName News in an exclusive statement that it is Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) who are “holding Americans hostage” by refusing to support any measures to curb mass illegal immigration.
“Angel Families, Border Patrol, DHS, ranchers and all other citizens affected by illegal alien crime are the proof [Pelosi and Schumer] need,” Mendoza said.
The latest polling from Harvard/Harris finds that more than 80 percent of American voters either strongly or somewhat support a crackdown on illegal alien crime, including 96 percent of Republicans, 70 percent of Democrats, and 79 percent of swing voters.

“If hundreds of thousands of American citizens affected annually by illegal alien crime isn’t enough to make every man, woman, and young adult take notice and listen to what could happen to any of them in the blink of an eye — and make our elected officials stand up and protect us over illegal aliens illegally present in our country — I don’t know what else to do,” Mendoza continued.
Mendoza said the president’s plan to form a negotiating committee to strike a deal that he hopes will at least partially fund construction of a border wall will reveal, starkly, who elected Democrats represent.
“Denial is not the answer,” Mendoza said. “Step up and acknowledge our hardships, loss, and lack of protection. If Democrats refuse to negotiate during this temporary fix, Americans will now know for certain who they fight fo, and it isn’t you and I.”
Illegal immigration at the southern border, for December 2018, has increased 81 percent compared to this same month the year before. Additionally, there were about 22,000 illegal alien minors who crossed the southern border last month.
Meanwhile, drug overdoses in 2017 killed an unprecedented 72,287 U.S. residents, nearly three times the number of individuals killed by global terrorism. Nearly 50,000 of those deadly overdoses were caused by either heroin or fentanyl.
Last year, alone, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency arrested nearly 2,000 convicted and suspected illegal alien killers, leaving behind countless American and legal immigrant victims.

Daily Caller,"House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California spoke out about his office being vandalized on “OutletName & Friends” Wednesday, then said it’s time to build a border wall.
McCarthy said vandals were caught on camera throwing a boulder through his California office window Saturday. The suspects are still at large. McCarthy sent out an Instagram post Tuesday asking for additional help with identifying the individuals.
“I don’t know why they did it or who did it. We just have the pictures from our own cameras of these two individuals. So I put it out on my own personal Facebook page trying to see if anybody knew who they were,” he told “OutletName & Friends.”
“They threw this — it’s a massive rock to throw through the window, and I don’t think one person could have thrown it by themselves. And then they entered the office — this was Saturday night at 9:54. And they stole some computer equipment and ran back out, got in a truck and took off. So we don’t know the motives. We don’t know why they did it, but I’d like to find out who they are and get our equipment back,” McCarthy continued.
He then switched gears to immigration and said he wants to lead the effort in the House to fully fund a border wall and finally start enforcing federal statutes.
“Well the bill is very simple. Build the wall, enforce the law,” McCarthy said. “Not only does it have the funding in there to build the wall … it actually enhances our ability to remove the MS-13 gang members. It ends sanctuary cities. It has ‘Kate’s Law.'”
He said fear of the approaching caravan of illegal immigrants is justified, but claimed he’s even more concerned with what will happen if Democrats win in November.
“Think for a moment, we’re worried about the caravan coming, but I’m more worried what happens on Nov. 6. If we are not successful on Nov. 6, think what it would mean with Nancy Pelosi as speaker?

CNN,"President Donald Trump entered the White House promising to change Washington , undo key accomplishments of his predecessor and realign the US approach to the international community and treatment of immigrants.
Despite a historically controversial tenure and major staff shakeups , the Trump administration is reshaping the direction and tenor of the federal government.
Here's a list of charts to show what has happened on a few key fronts:
Replacing Obamacare
Republicans vowed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, from its inception. They spent much of Trump's first year in power trying to do so, and although they have chipped away at major pillars of Obamacare, the law remains on the books.
Majority Leader McConnell decided not to hold a vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill . They currently lack the 50 votes needed to pass the legislation. ""It's obvious -- we don't have the votes right now"" said Sen. Tim Scott.
The final bill language is up in the air, 51-50 vote sets up days of debate and amendment votes . Sen. John McCain returned to Washington for the vote.
Final vote was 217-213 , with 20 Republicans and all Democrats opposing the bill. Trump confident bill will pass the Senate. Democrats taunted Republicans after vote, believing GOP will suffer in 2018 elections.
House Republicans pull health care bill after all-day drama searching for votes. Trump has said he wants Republicans to pass the bill or live with Obamacare remaining law.
Tax reform
The newly minted tax law shells out major tax cuts and restructures the federal tax system, with analysis of the plan showing benefits skewed for top earners and corporations.
Percent change in after-tax income of the Conference Agreement for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act By expanded cash income percentile 2018 2025 2027 Lowest Quintile Second Quintile Middle Quintile Fourth Quintile Top Quintile Top 1 Percent 0.5% -0.5% 1.5% 2.5% 3.5% Source: Urban-Brookings, Tax Policy Center, microsimulation model (version 0217-1).
It also makes significant changes in other policy areas, including the elimination of Obamacare's individual coverage mandate and opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas drilling
A Congressional Budget Office estimate for the conference agreement announced mid-December said the bill would add $1.455 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. The Tax Policy Center mapped out how different groups would benefit -- or not -- over time under the plan, and it projected that people with the highest incomes would see the biggest cuts, while lower earners would see smaller changes to their tax bills, or even have less money after taxes than they would without the bill.

Trump has unapologetically continued his frequent and provocative tweeting, promoting his agenda, attacking the media and issuing thoughts seemingly as they come. He has done so a lot.
The tweets occasionally upend the news cycle, and something of a cottage industry has sprung up to derive some sort of pattern.
The Trump Twitter Archive is one attempt to store the tweets and try to find a way to understand the President's behavior. By their count, Trump has tweeted some 2,600 times since taking office.
Economy
Monthly unemployment rate and labor force participation rate, 2017 Unemployment rate Labor force participation rate 5.0% 63.0% 62.9% 4.9% 62.8% 4.8% 62.7% 4.7% 62.6% 4.6% 62.5% 4.5% 62.4% 4.4% 62.3% 4.3% 62.2% 4.2% 62.1% 4.1% Jan. Mar. May Jul. Sep. Nov. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, seasonally adjusted.
Trump's first year in office saw job growth continue and the unemployment rate reaching lows unthinkable at the height of the recession.
At the same time, the stock market has soared since Trump's election victory, with analysts crediting the expectation -- and then the delivery -- of tax reform for much of the bullish investor sentiment.
Trump has touted the blooming economy and taken credit for the major rise in the stock market. This week, the Dow Jones industrial average broke 26,000, a record high and a jump of about 8,000 points since the presidential election.
Around the same time as the new high for the Dow, Apple announced it would pay $38 billion in taxes and add 20,000 jobs to the US -- another move Trump made sure to note.
Immigration
From the outset of the Trump era, the situation began to change at the US-Mexico border, according to US Customs and Border Protection data. The government information shows the number of apprehensions at that border were down sharply relative to the same months in recent years.
Additionally, Immigration and Customs Enforcement data say the number of ""interior removals"" was up significantly compared with the same period in 2016. The data showing ramped up enforcement for ICE included an overall increase in arrests, which ICE said ticked up after Trump signed an order on January 25, 2017, calling on the Department of Homeland Security to boost its operations.

The already heated immigration debate has grown hotter still since Trump made derogatory and demeaning remarks in an Oval Office meeting with lawmakers this month about creating a permanent fix for people protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
The Trump administration late last year announced it would end the Temporary Protected Status designation for Haiti, a move that could affect tens of thousands of Haitian immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security announced in January that it would end such protections for more than 200,000 Salvadorans, and later in the week, the White House rejected a bipartisan immigration proposal, including a fix for DACA.
Legislation
58 109 0 Executive orders Bills signed into law Vetoes
Trump entered office with his party ascendant, for the first time in a decade controlling both houses of Congress and the White House. The GOP's narrow majority in the Senate has hampered their efforts some, but since Trump has taken office, they've gotten 109 bills of varying significance into law, and Trump has issued dozens of executive orders, perhaps most notably his attempts to impose restrictions on travel from several majority-Muslim nations.
Military
Combat deaths during the Trump administration 10 12 2 4 6 8 Afghanistan Iraq Other Source: Review of Pentagon announcements from January 20, 2017-January 17, 2017
Under Trump, the US war on terror has continued, and in some senses, the US footprint has expanded
US airstrikes in Somalia and Yemen ramped up under Trump, and a deadly incident in Niger drew more attention to the US military's involvement across Africa.
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford said in October that the US has about 6,000 troops in Africa, ""and they're in about 53 different countries.""
2017 saw Iraq declare ISIS defeated there, and Trump has stressed his belief that the militant group was nearing its end.
Trump in August opted not to pull the US out of Afghanistan, where 12 service members died from combat during the President's first year, according to a review of Pentagon announcements on casualties.
The US-led coalition against ISIS announced the first death of a US service member in Syria in 2016, and in Trump's first year, the Defense Department announced two US military deaths in Syria, one in ""a non-combat-related incident"" and the other from injuries in a ""vehicle rollover related incident.""
International (and domestic) standing
International polls taken in 2015 and 2016 compared with those taken in 2017 showed shifts in views of the US, with declining opinions among several major US allies, a standstill from Israel and a boost in Russia and Vietnam.
On the domestic side, satisfaction with the direction of the country , as with most matters of public opinion, is stratified by party.
Trump made his first international trip to Saudi Arabia, and during his first year he toured the Middle East, Europe and Asia.
He moved to pull the US out of the Paris agreement on climate change and withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He has continued to certify Iran in compliance with a multilateral nuclear agreement, but he criticized the agreement along the way, and threatened to withdraw from NAFTA.
On the homefront, Trump visited dozens of states and Puerto Rico.
Natural disasters
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said 2017's combined weather and climate disasters broke the US record for annual cumulative cost, at a total north of $300 billion, including hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico, Florida and Texas.
As direct and indirect consequences of the disasters continue for years, the costs will inevitably rise, making these numbers uncertain, as unfortunately is true for the body count
Russia
Outside of Trump's actions, maneuvering in Congress and the President's picks reworking federal departments, a ""cloud"" hangs over much of the political world.
The myriad investigations related to Russian interference in the 2016 US election and potential attempts to coordinate with Trump's associates continue, leading to backlash from the President and regular developments gripping Washington.","president donald trump entered the white house promising to change washington, undo key accomplishments of his predecessor and realign the us approach to the international community and treatment of immigrants. despite a historically controversial tenure and major staff shakeups, the trump administration is reshaping the direction and tenor of the federal government. here's a list of charts to show what has happened on a few key fronts : replacing obamacare republicans vowed to repeal and replace the affordable care act, more commonly known as obamacare, from its inception. they spent much of trump's first year in power trying to do so, and although they have chipped away at major pillars of obamacare, the law remains on the books. majority leader mcconnell decided not to hold a vote on the graham - cassidy bill. they currently lack the 50 votes needed to pass the legislation.

Breitbart,"The Texas Office of the Attorney General (OAG) confirmed to OutletName Texas that it is conducting an investigation into a possible violation of the state’s new sanctuary city law by San Antonio Police Chief William McManus. The investigation could lead to a criminal prosecution under the SB4 anti-sanctuary city law passed in the 2017 legislative session.
“Our office has received multiple complaints alleging that the San Antonio police chief violated Senate Bill 4, the Texas law prohibiting sanctuary city policies that the attorney general has authority to enforce,” OAG spokesman Mark Rylander said in response to an inquiry from OutletName Texas. “We have begun our investigation and demanded that the San Antonio Police Department preserve all of its records relating to the incident.”
The AG Ken Paxton’s office also sent a letter to the City of San Antonio demanding the preservation of any evidence that might be related to the case.
“Several citizens have filed complaints with the Texas Attorney General’s Office regarding an incident on December 23 involving the release of numerous suspected illegal aliens,” Assistant Texas Attorney General Cleve W. Doty wrote in the letter (attached below) which is also addressed to the San Antonio Police Department, City Council, City Manager Sheryl Sculley, City Attorney Andy Segovia, Mayor Ron Nirenberg, and Police Chief William McManus.
“The Texas Attorney General’s Office will investigate these complaints and the procedure in Senate Bill 4 contemplates litigation,” Doty continued. “We demand that you affirmatively preserve all relevant materials.”
The AG’s office is asking for records of all of the officers involved in the incident, any recordings of the incident, office and personal phone records of Chief McManus, his assistants, and the officers involved in the incident, and any orders Chief McManus gave to any subordinate officer regarding the incident or the illegal immigrants.
The letter demands written confirmation by Monday, January 15.
“This letter serves to warn you of your duty to preserve all relevant information pending an imminent, statutorily-mandated investigation,” Doty concluded in the letter.
In May 2017, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the nation’s toughest law prohibiting local police from interfering with immigration law enforcement.
“All law enforcement officers are going to be required to follow this law,” Governor Abbott told OutletName Texas in an exclusive interview immediately after signing the SB4 bill into law. “If they refuse to follow this law, or if they adopt sanctuary city policies, they are subject now to the stiffest penalties in America for adopting sanctuary city policies – which includes jail time where sheriffs could wind up in the same jail they may be releasing inmates from who are the subject of ICE detainer requests.”
The law provides both civil and criminal penalties for city and law enforcement officials who violate the law.
It appears this will be the first investigation by the Texas OAG into potential violations of the State’s new law.
“We finally have a higher authority looking into the chief’s conduct,” San Antonio Police Officers Association President Mike Helle told OutletName Texas on Thursday morning. “That is a good thing.”

Daily Caller,"A Silicon Valley man who provided logistical support and recruited for al-Qaida had his U.S. citizenship revoked by a federal judge Thursday.
Egyptian-born Khaled Abu Dahab, 57, confessed to being a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, an al-Qaida affiliate, and said he had personal ties to Osama Bin Laden.
Dahab told U.S. investigators he ran a communications hub for the terrorist network from his apartment in Santa Clara, Calif., the OutletName reported. He also recruited Americans to join al-Qaida, a job he did so well that he received congratulations from Bin Laden himself, U.S. authorities said.
Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered an order that revoked Dahab’s naturalized U.S. citizenship and enjoined him from claiming any rights of citizenship. The order further demanded that Dahab immediately surrender his certificate of naturalization to federal authorities, Department of Justice officials said.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions praised the decision and said DOJ would seek to “aggressively pursue denaturalization of known or suspected terrorists” in the future.
“We will protect our national security and our borders, and when we identify individuals tied to foreign terrorist organizations who procured their U.S. citizenship by fraud, we will initiate denaturalization proceedings–whether you reside here or abroad–and ensure you are denied entry into the United States,” Sessions said in a statement. (RELATED: Sessions Warns Incoming Illegal Immigrants: ‘Don’t Come’)
Howell’s order is the final step in a process initiated by federal authorities in 2015. DOJ was seeking the revocation of Dahab’s U.S. citizenship on the grounds that he lied during his naturalization proceedings and hid the fact that he was a member of an international terrorist group.
In addition to his recruiting activities, Dahab admitted to attending a training camp near Jalalabad, Afghanistan, where he taught foreign fighters to fly hang gliders in preparation for terrorist attacks. He facilitated from Santa Clara the transfer of fake passports, documents, and money that materially supported terrorist attacks in Egypt and Pakistan, DOJ officials said.
Dahab was naturalized on Feb. 7, 1997. He traveled to Egypt the next year and was arrested by Egyptian authorities on terrorism-related charges.

NYTimes,"President Trump has called for imposing tariffs on Mexico, the administration’s latest attempt to slow the stream of migrant families who have been arriving at the southwest border by the thousands each day. It is just the latest move by the president to rein in illegal immigration after a series of executive orders, regulations, ramped-up border security and diplomatic threats have failed to dissuade Central Americans, mostly fleeing poverty and violence, from journeying north. In fact, migrant families have continued to arrive in unprecedented numbers. Nearly 110,000 people were apprehended at or near the border last month, the largest number since 2007. On Wednesday alone, the Border Patrol in El Paso encountered a group of 1,036 migrants, the largest single group ever. Since his days on the campaign trail, the president has made unauthorized immigration central to his agenda, framing it as a threat to national security that creates unfair competition for American workers. Thursday’s announcement that the government would impose across-the-board tariffs on Mexico until that country made significant reductions in the number of people entering the United States prompted a number of warnings: that it would impede manufacturing supply chains, jeopardize a new North American trade agreement, and impede cooperation with Mexico over immigration issues. The bigger question — will it work — is unknowable for now. What is more clear is that little else has worked so far — in some cases because the administration’s initiatives are so constitutionally questionable that they have been blocked by the courts and not been given a chance to work. Here’s a look at some of the policies that the administration has tried to carry out. Family separations
In July 2017, the Department of Homeland Security undertook an experimental program in the El Paso area under which it filed criminal charges against all adults illegally crossing the border and sent their children sent to government shelters. It was effective: By October, the last month of the trial program, the number of families apprehended had dropped by nearly two-thirds. That perceived success set the stage for a national rollout of the policy the following year, which would become known as the zero-tolerance program. The attorney general announced on May 7, 2018, that all illegal border crossers would be referred for prosecution, prompting the forced separation of thousands of families. The practice was met with public outrage, and lasted until the president issued an executive order ending it on June 20. Afterward, the number of migrant families arriving at the border continued to increase. Threats to close the border
Mr. Trump threatened in March to close all or part of the border with Mexico if the neighboring country did not “immediately” stop the flow of migrants passing through its territory to reach the United States. “If Mexico does not immediately stop ALL the illegal immigration that enters the United States through our southern border, I will be CLOSING the border, or large sections of the border, next week,” the president said on Twitter. The threat may have made the problem worse: There were widespread reports that smugglers who transport Central Americans across Mexico were telling those considering to come to the United States to move fast — before the president made good on his promise. The border was never closed. Scaling back asylum
Mr. Trump has criticized the asylum system, under which certain kinds of people facing persecution in their homelands can seek safe shelter in the United States. As the president sees it, many migrants with no legitimate claim are taking advantage of the asylum system to get into the country and build new lives while their requests are being adjudicated by an immigration judge. In the fall, the president issued a proclamation preventing anyone who crossed the border between official ports of entry from making an asylum claim. A federal judge in San Francisco blocked the policy’s implementation, one of several court orders that have prevented the administration from putting up barriers to asylum. In February, the administration issued guidance to asylum officers who conduct “credible fear” interviews at the border, the first step applicants must pass, tightening standards for eligibility. However, the vast majority of migrants entering the country are no longer being granted asylum interviews at the border. They skip this step altogether and seek asylum once they have been released into the interior of the country and are placed in deportation proceedings — so tightening standards for initial interviews became moot. More recently, the Department of Homeland Security has said that Border Patrol agents would be trained to conduct the preliminary screening. Critics of such a policy say the agents are unlikely to be qualified for a job that is usually performed by asylum officers who often have law degrees. The administration so far has not carried out the plan. Quotas for immigration judges
In the summer of 2018, the Justice Department, which oversees the immigration courts, imposed a quota requiring each immigration judge to complete 700 cases a year. That directive has not dented the swelling backlog in the courts — one of the biggest reasons for delays in deporting migrants who are not eligible to remain in the United States. The backlog now exceeds 850,000, and grew substantially early this year when a partial government shutdown — a result of an impasse over Mr. Trump’s demand for border funding — closed the courts. In fact, the backlog has ballooned by more than 200,000 since Mr. Trump became president. The government has begun to add judges, but has failed to invest in modernizing the antiquated immigration system. For now, migrants heading to the United States can expect to live in the country for years before their cases are completed. Limiting arrivals at border stations
Last year, Customs and Border Protection began limiting the number of asylum seekers that it would process through ports of entry along the border, stranding thousands of applicants in Mexico for weeks as they wait for their numbers to be called. The policy has encouraged tens of thousands of migrants to divert from well-staffed entry points and turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents in remote areas along the border. Keeping asylum seekers in Mexico
In January, the Department of Homeland Security unveiled a series of “migrant protection” protocols, commonly referred to as a “remain in Mexico” policy, calling for asylum applicants to be sent back to Mexico while their cases wind through the immigration courts. Since starting in California, the practice has been expanded to Texas, resulting in more than 6,004 asylum seekers being returned to Mexico. Vulnerable migrants, including pregnant women, parents with disabled children and transgender people have been among those returned. Advocacy groups have sued to block the practice. A panel of district court judges has yet to rule on the legality of the policy, but has allowed it to remain in place for the time being. Cutting off aid
In late March, Mr. Trump cut off $500 million in annual aid to Central American countries, saying that those nations were “taking our money” and “doing absolutely nothing.” Mr. Trump said the move was intended to force leaders of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to halt emigration from their countries. But many experts said the policy would be counterproductive: That assistance, they said, was vital to addressing the root causes of migration, such as corruption, violence and poverty. Detaining migrant families
In September 2018, the administration introduced a proposal to allow migrant families to be detained for indefinite periods of time. It was an attempt to alter a court settlement that limits the number of days children can remain incarcerated to about 20. Following the end of a mandated comment period for the public, the government is expected to publish a formal regulation soon. It is almost certain to face legal challenges. Sending the military to the border
In April 2018, the president ordered the Pentagon to deploy 4,000 members of the National Guard to the southern border. In October that year, more than 5,000 active-duty Army troops were also sent to the border, a number that has since been cut back. But neither the National Guard nor the Army is allowed to actively engage in border enforcement activities. Most National Guard troops were performing duties such as erecting fences and cutting grass. Border wall
Mr. Trump has declared his intention to build a wall along the southern border since the start of his presidential campaign, though there is little new fencing to show for it. Congress appropriated $1.375 billion for border barriers in the 2019 fiscal year, less than the president’s request for $5.7 billion. In February, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency to access $3.6 billion from military construction projects to erect a wall. He also ordered $3.1 billion in funds to be transferred from counterdrug activities and a Treasury Department fund. A federal court issued an injunction against the appropriation of such funds, and the court is still considering the larger case.","president trump has called for imposing tariffs on mexico, the administration ’ s latest attempt to slow the stream of migrant families who have been arriving at the southwest border by the thousands each day. it is just the latest move by the president to rein in illegal immigration after a series of executive orders, regulations, ramped - up border security and diplomatic threats have failed to dissuade central americans, mostly fleeing poverty and violence, from journeying north. in fact, migrant families have continued to arrive in unprecedented numbers. nearly 110, 000 people were apprehended at or near the border last month, the largest number since 2007. on wednesday alone, the border patrol in el paso encountered a group of 1, 036 migrants, the largest single group ever. since his days on the campaign trail, the president has made unauthorized immigration central to his agenda, framing it as a threat to national security that creates unfair competition for american workers. thursday ’ s announcement that the government would impose across - the - board tariffs on mexico until that country made significant reductions in the number of people entering the united states prompted a number of warnings : that it would impede manufacturing supply chains, jeopardize a new north american trade agreement, and impede cooperation with mexico over immigration issues. the bigger question — will it work — is unknowable for now. what is more clear is that little else has worked so far — in some cases because the administration ’ s initiatives are so constitutionally questionable that they have been blocked by the courts and not been given a chance to work. here ’ s a look at some of the policies that the administration has tried to carry out. family separations in july 2017, the department of homeland security undertook an experimental program in the el paso area under which it filed criminal charges against all adults illegally crossing the border and sent their children sent to government shelters. it was effective : by october, the last month of the trial program, the number of families apprehended had dropped by nearly two - thirds. that perceived success set the stage for a national rollout of the policy the following year, which would become known as the zero - tolerance program. the attorney general announced on may 7, 2018, that all illegal border crossers would be referred for prosecution, prompting the forced separation of thousands of families. the practice was met with public outrage, and lasted until the president issued an executive order ending it on june 20. afterward, the number of migrant families arriving at the border continued to increase. threats to close",0.999969244003295,0.499969257190969,1,432,3.24,6.71,9.95,1.62,2.55,6.02,7.18,0.69,2.08,0.93,1.62,0.0,1.85,0.0,0.23,0.0,0.23,0.0,9.49,1.39,0.0,0.0,0.46,0.0,0.0,4.4,0.93,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23,1.62,11.34,2.31,8.33,0.23,0.0,0.0,6.48,4.63,2.55,0.46,7.638888888888889,13.425925925925927,2.314814814814815
Daily Caller,"An illegal immigrant activist claimed Monday that “white supremacist politicians” who oppose amnesty have “one goal,” and that is to imprison and deport all “people of color.”
“Make no mistake. This is our home and we are here to stay,” Greisa Martinez Rosas, director of advocacy policy at United We Dream, said on a conference call with reporters.
United We Dream claims to be the largest immigrant youth-led organization in the country and held the call a day before nationwide rallies Tuesday on the fifth anniversary of the DACA program launched by President Obama.
The program protects roughly 800,000 illegal immigrants from deportation and allows them to work. President Trump vowed to end the program, but has yet to do so.
“The DACA program is under threat by white supremacist politicians,” Rosas, an illegal immigrant, said. “White supremacist politicians who have one goal: to push all people of color in jails, and into detention camps, off the voter rolls and out of our country.”
United We Dream did not respond to a request for comment about who these white supremacist politicians are.
The White House continues to maintain that it is reviewing what to do with the DACA program.

Breitbart,"Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), appearing on OutletName Sunday morning, slammed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for calling President Donald Trump’s new immigration proposal a plan to “make America white again” on Friday.
“You know what? We don’t need that type of rhetoric on either side,” Manchin told OutletName’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union. Asked whether that meant he “condemned” Pelosi’s remark, Manchin replied that his criticism would apply to both sides: “I’m condemning all this crazy rhetoric that goes on. Just because someone’s a Republican — it’s not my enemy. And we have to work together.”
On Friday, Pelosi said:
Since I’m on the subject of Dreamers, since last night, the president put forth a plan. Let me just say what I said last night, that plan is a campaign to make America white again. It is a plan that says over 50 percent of the current legal immigration will be cut back. … They are changing the character of our country by what they are putting forth. They bring a tear to the eye of the Statue of Liberty.
Pelosi also defended “sanctuary cities” such as her home town of San Francisco.
Trump’s proposal, revealed on Thursday, would grant a “path to citizenship” to 1.8 million so-called “Dreamers” — illegal aliens brought to the country as minors — even if they were not among the roughly 800,000 who applied for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. In return, Trump is demanding $25 billion for border security (including a border wall along most of the U.S.-Mexico border), an end to chain migration, and the cancellation of the diversity visa lottery.
Each of these provisions enjoys wide support among Americans, according to opinion polls. As the OutletName noted last week, a new Harvard-Harris poll “found that 65% of voters overall agreed with Trump’s position that any bill codifying Obama-era protections for illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children should be accompanied by funding for a wall, ending chain migration, and ending the diversity visa lottery program.”
However, Democrats are furious because the plan would cut off their efforts to legalize potentially tens of millions of additional illegal aliens, and forces them to choose between helping the “Dreamers” — the poster children for immigration reform — and pursuing their broader immigration ambitions.
Republicans charge that Democrats are more interested in importing new voters than in helping the people they purport to represent. Advocates for “Dreamers” complain that Trump proposals would make them “second-class citizens” by preventing them from sponsoring family members who brought them to the country illegally.
Manchin was cautiously open to Trump’s plan, hinting that he wanted to see more illegal aliens eligible for a “path to citizenship.”
He cited the Gang of Eight bill in 2013, which passed the Senate but failed in the House, noting that it included funding for border security and legal status for 11 million illegal aliens. That, Manchin suggested, was an example of “going big” on both legalization and border security, whereas Trump’s proposal only went “big” on the latter and “small” on the former.

Breitbart,"President Donald Trump singled out border patrol agents’ representatives Chris Crane and Brandon Judd for praise during a policy speech Wednesday, thanking them for their service and promising they will be allowed to carry out their jobs under his administration.
“We are going to restore the rule of law in the United States. Before we go any further, I want to recognize the ICE and border patrol officers in this room today, and to honor their service, and not just because they unanimously endorsed me for president,” Trump said.
“That helps! But that’s not the only reason,” he joked. “I also want to acknowledge two individuals in the audience who will play a very, very important role going forward. I’d like to recognize Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, and Chris Crane… the president of the National ICE Council. You guys are about to be very, very busy doing your jobs they want you want to do them.”
Trump pointed them out in the audience to applause and thanked them.
The National ICE Council, which represents thousands of ICE agents, endorsed Trump ahead of the first presidential debate—the first time the Council ever endorsed any candidate for public office.
“America has been lied to about every aspect of immigration in the United States,” Crane said when announcing the endorsement. “We can fix our broken immigration system, and we can do it in a way that honors America’s legacy as a land of immigrants, but Donald Trump is the only candidate who is willing to put politics aside so that we can achieve that goal. We hereby endorse Donald J. Trump, and urge all Americans, especially the millions of lawful immigrants living within our country, to support Donald J. Trump, and to protect American jobs, wages and lives.”
Crane himself worked tirelessly during the presidential campaign to protest the handcuffing of ICE officers the Obama administration looked the other way while massive surges of illegal immigration flowed into the country. Ignored by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration, Crane found in Trump a candidate who wholeheartedly supported law enforcement. Trump went out of his way to organize a meeting with Crane and other ICE officers and invited Crane to appear at a campaign rally with him.
“This is not the person that you frequently see on TV. He was very welcoming, very sincere. He really wanted to hear from boots on the ground, officers out in the field about what’s happening,” Crane said. “There’s no two ways about it—he was definitely more informed on the issues than a lot of members of Congress that I’ve met with in my lifetime.”
Judd had also appeared with Trump during a OutletName town hall, saying, “We have to end the catch-and-release program. You’ve got to get rid of that magic magnet that is bringing these people over here.” The National Border Patrol Council, which represents over 17,000 border patrol agents, likewise endorsed Trump in a bold statement in March. “Mr. Trump is as bold and outspoken as other world leaders who put their country’s interests ahead of all else,” they stated. “Our current political establishment has bled this country dry, sees their power evaporating, and isn’t listening to voters who do all the heavy lifting. Trump is opposed by the established powers specifically because they know he is the only candidate who actually threatens the established powers that have betrayed this country.”
Trump and his campaign maintained that immigration enforcement policies will be determined by the men and women doing the dangerous hard work of securing U.S. borders, not by bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.
Trump signed two executive orders and said he will enforce existing immigration laws rather than crafting new ones.","president donald trump singled out border patrol agents ’ representatives chris crane and brandon judd for praise during a policy speech wednesday, thanking them for their service and promising they will be allowed to carry out their jobs under his administration. “ we are going to restore the rule of law in the united states. before we go any further, i want to recognize the ice and border patrol officers in this room today, and to honor their service, and not just because they unanimously endorsed me for president, ” trump said. “ that helps! but that ’ s not the only reason, ” he joked. “ i also want to acknowledge two individuals in the audience who will play a very, very important role going forward. i ’ d like to recognize brandon judd, the president of the national border patrol council, and chris crane … the president of the national ice council. you guys are about to be very, very busy doing your jobs they want you want to do them. ” trump pointed them out in the audience to applause and thanked them. the national ice council, which represents thousands of ice agents, endorsed trump ahead of the first presidential debate — the first time the council ever endorsed any candidate for public office. “ america has been lied to about every aspect of immigration in the united states, ” crane said when announcing the endorsement. “ we can fix our broken immigration system, and we can do it in a way that honors america ’ s legacy as a land of immigrants, but donald trump is the only candidate who is willing to put politics aside so that we can achieve that goal. we hereby endorse donald j. trump, and urge all americans, especially the millions of lawful immigrants living within our country, to support donald j. trump, and to protect american jobs, wages and lives. ” crane himself worked tirelessly during the presidential campaign to protest the handcuffing of ice officers the obama administration looked the other way while massive surges of illegal immigration flowed into the country. ignored by democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton and the obama administration, crane found in trump a candidate who wholeheartedly supported law enforcement. trump went out of his way to organize a meeting with crane and other ice officers and invited crane to appear at a campaign rally with him. “ this is not the person that you frequently see on tv. he was very welcoming, very sincere. he really wanted to hear from boots on the ground, officers out in the field about what ’ s happening, ” crane said. “ there ’ s no two ways about it — he was",3.14652825181e-05,0.499968528747558,0,433,1.39,2.31,9.24,2.31,1.39,5.54,6.7,1.15,0.92,1.85,0.46,0.23,1.85,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.08,0.69,0.23,4.39,0.23,0.0,0.69,0.23,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23,0.23,9.93,1.39,7.39,0.69,0.46,0.0,2.77,3.7,3.0,2.08,5.542725173210162,8.545034642032332,1.6166281755196306

Listen to the show:
Immediately after the president’s speech to the nation, the media was on its way to making it the most fact-checked speech in history. No detail was too insignificant to be checked.

FoxNews,"Making good on a promise to overturn Obama-era immigration policies, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests increased 38 percent during the first three months of the Trump administration.
''These statistics reflect President Trump's commitment to enforce our immigration laws fairly and across the board,'' said ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan.
The increase reflects arrests made not at the border, but in U.S. cities, so called 'interior enforcement,” something critics say almost disappeared in the last year of the Obama Administration.
TRUMP'S TOUGH IMMIGRATION RHETORIC SLOWS ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS: 'WE'RE AT A TRICKLE'
According to the Department of Homeland Security:
* ICE has arrested more than 41,000 individuals who are either known or suspected of being in the country illegally. This reflects an increase of 37.6 percent over the same period in 2016.
* Nearly 75 percent of those arrested during this period in 2017 are convicted criminals, with offenses ranging from homicide and assault to sexual abuse and drug-related charges.
* The arrest of aliens at-large in the community increased by more than 50 percent.
* The arrest of convicted illegal immigrants climbed nearly 20 percent
* The arrest of non-criminal illegal immigrants rose 150 percent, to 10,800 since the beginning of the year compared to 4,200 in the same period in 2016.
The arrest of non-criminal illegal immigrants is controversial. To advocates, entering the U.S. illegally is a civil crime not worth punishing.
Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck believes shielding illegal immigrants from deportation increases the likelihood they'll cooperate with police in catching criminal aliens. He raised the point during a news conference following the arrest of 44 members of the brutal gang MS-13, half of whom are in the U.S. illegally.
""Many of witnesses that allowed us to do this by their statements – also have immigration issues,"" said Beck. ""You could say sanctuary policies make us successful (because) we get people to talk.""
CALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS PUSH PLANS TO PUNISH SANCTUARY CITIES
The Los Angeles Police Commission is considering a proposal to ignore crimes like loitering, graffiti, and sleeping in cars to counter immigrant fears that ICE will track police arrests, leading to their deportation for minor crimes. But opponents blame such policies for the rise in non-criminal immigrant arrests.
""Numerous law enforcement agencies have taken the step to not even honor detainers and that makes it extremely difficult for us,"" says Los Angeles ICE Director Dave Marin. ""They're just letting these individuals, convicted criminal aliens, and they're letting them out the door.""
That forces agents to conduct fugitive operations on the streets and in the workplace, whereas in the past ICE could pick criminal aliens up directly from jail.
Now, Marin says, agents encounter more spouses, relatives and co-workers who did not commit crime but were here illegally. Unlike the Obama administration, which used “prosecutorial discretion” to release non-criminals illegal immigrants, ICE under Trump does not, which explains the 150 percent increase.
In January, at his inauguration, President Trump said: ""A nation without borders is not a nation. Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders.""
The new arrest numbers support that claim, as many at the Department of Homeland Security say border security doesn't start at the border, but in cities, where actual enforcement leads to deterrence.","making good on a promise to overturn obama - era immigration policies, immigration and customs enforcement arrests increased 38 percent during the first three months of the trump administration.'' these statistics reflect president trump's commitment to enforce our immigration laws fairly and across the board,'' said ice acting director thomas homan. the increase reflects arrests made not at the border, but in u. s. cities, so called'interior enforcement, ” something critics say almost disappeared in the last year of the obama administration. trump's tough immigration rhetoric slows illegal border crossings :'we're at a trickle'according to the department of homeland security : * ice has arrested more than 41, 000 individuals who are either known or suspected of being in the country illegally. this reflects an increase of 37. 6 percent over the same period in 2016. * nearly 75 percent of those arrested during this period in 2017 are convicted criminals, with offenses ranging from homicide and assault to sexual abuse and drug - related charges. * the arrest of aliens at - large in the community increased by more than 50 percent. * the arrest of convicted illegal immigrants climbed nearly 20 percent * the arrest of non - criminal illegal immigrants rose 150 percent, to 10, 800 since the beginning of the year compared to 4, 200 in the same period in 2016. the arrest of non - criminal illegal immigrants is controversial. to advocates, entering the u. s. illegally is a civil crime not worth punishing. los angeles police chief charlie beck believes shielding illegal immigrants from deportation increases the likelihood they'll cooperate with police in catching criminal aliens. he raised the point during a news conference following the arrest of 44 members of the brutal gang ms - 13, half of whom are in the u. s. illegally.

FoxNews,"Last Monday evening, eight U.S. congressmen and I stood on a bluff overlooking the Mariposa Port of Entry in Nogales, Arizona, at the southern border with Mexico. We were wrapping up a two-day tour of the border by getting a bird's-eye view of the thousands of cars and tractor-trailers carrying freight that enter America every day through this busy port.
It was a chance to see multiple elements of an effective border security plan – walls, roads and infrastructure, cameras and sensors -- and most importantly, highly trained and professional Border Patrol agents.
While we stood there, the cameras and sensors detected a man pushing concertina wire away from the slatted fence, so he could climb the barrier and slide down on the American side. He then raced into the brush at the bottom of the bluff on which we were standing. Shortly after, he hid. Two Border Patrol trucks raced up and agents rushed out. They found his hiding place and took him into custody.
REP. ANDY BIGGS: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ONLY ONE OPTION LEFT -- DECLARE AN EMERGENCY AT THE BORDER
In this case, a single illegal immigrant was apprehended because all the elements of border security were present. But what about the thousands of acres and miles where there is no wall to slow illegal crossings? What about the ravines and valleys that do not have camera or sensor coverage? And, most importantly, even if there is technology assisting in detection and surveillance, how do we capture illegal immigrants when our Border Patrol doesn’t have roads to drive on, radios for communication, and must patrol thousands of square miles with only a handful of agents?
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., insists that building a border wall is “immoral.” I wonder when she last visited the border, spoke with agents, or conversed with families who live and work along it. Has she seen and heard the stories of the victims of the criminal violence that comes across the border, or counted the tens of thousands of people who have been harmed by the scourge of illegal drug and human trafficking?
Tons of drugs have been seized at ports of entry and even between the ports, and no one knows how many more tons are not interdicted. Approximately 40 percent of the drugs seized on our borders come through the Tucson sector. Again, that’s just what we catch.
We don’t know what we don’t know. That’s what’s important in this debate. What we know is devastating enough.
Death and addiction costs related to illegal drugs are backbreaking to this country. We have victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. The frontier is rugged and exacts a physical toll, resulting in the deaths of many trying to enter the country illegally. Drug and human smugglers commit crimes against their human cargo with impunity, creating a humanitarian crisis. Environmentalists should be concerned by the ecological damage being inflicted by border crossers. Economic damage includes suppression of wages and technological innovation resulting from cheap labor.
We simply do not know the full extent of all of the problems caused and exacerbated by illegal immigrants, regardless of whether their motive to enter is malevolent or benign.
What we can be certain of is that as long as there are incentives to enter and stay illegally in this country, people will continue to flood our borders.
When my congressional colleagues and I stood on the bluff overlooking the Mariposa Port of Entry, and witnessed the apprehension of the illegal immigrant, we saw what a fully funded and functioning border security strategy might look like. The foundational element is to slow down illegal entrants. You do that by building a wall.
As Mary Ann Mendoza, an Angel mother whose son was killed by an illegal immigrant, said, “A wall won’t stop everyone, but no wall won’t stop anyone.”

HuffPost,"Critics immediately panned President Donald Trump’s prime-time speech pushing for a U.S.-Mexico border wall for its numerous lies and misrepresentations, even on the president’s favorite network.
OutletName anchor Shepard Smith challenged many of Trump’s claims by using the government’s own numbers.
After Trump said that “innocent people” are being “horribly victimized” by immigrants who commit crimes, Smith quickly added perspective.
“The government’s statistics show that there is less violent crime by the undocumented immigrant population than by the general population,” he said.
Trump also argued for his wall by saying that immigrants carry illegal drugs across the border, but Smith pointed out that a wall wouldn’t make much difference there.
“Government statistics show much of the heroin actually comes not over the unguarded border but through ports of call,” he said.
Smith continued:
“He talks about undocumented crossings over the past months. In fact, the number of undocumented crossings over the southern border has been steadily down over the last 10 years and the government reports that there is more outward traffic than inward traffic.”
Smith also pushed back on Trump’s claims that Mexico will pay for the wall via a revised trade deal.","critics immediately panned president donald trump ’ s prime - time speech pushing for a u. s. - mexico border wall for its numerous lies and misrepresentations, even on the president ’ s favorite network. outletname anchor shepard smith challenged many of trump ’ s claims by using the government ’ s own numbers. after trump said that “ innocent people ” are being “ horribly victimized ” by immigrants who commit crimes, smith quickly added perspective. “ the government ’ s statistics show that there is less violent crime by the undocumented immigrant population than by the general population, ” he said. trump also argued for his wall by saying that immigrants carry illegal drugs across the border, but smith pointed out that a wall wouldn ’ t make much difference there. “ government statistics show much of the heroin actually comes not over the unguarded border but through ports of call, ” he said. smith continued : “ he talks about undocumented crossings over the past months. in fact, the number of undocumented crossings over the southern border has been steadily down over the last 10 years and the government reports that there is more outward traffic than inward traffic. ” smith also pushed back on trump ’ s claims that mexico will pay for the wall via a revised trade deal.",0.999956846237182,0.499956870400638,1,204,0.49,5.39,2.45,0.0,0.49,1.96,5.39,0.49,0.98,0.0,0.0,0.49,2.94,0.0,0.98,0.0,0.98,0.0,12.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.96,0.0,0.0,2.45,0.98,0.0,1.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.71,1.96,11.27,0.98,0.0,0.0,4.41,4.41,2.94,0.49,6.862745098039216,9.803921568627452,3.431372549019608
FoxNews,"You’ve heard it a thousand times, so many times it’s like background noise: Walls are racist. We could give you a thousand examples, but here’s a just one, from MSOutletName over this past weekend:
 
""This wall that the president wants is a monument to white nationalism,"" said Jason Johnson, political editor for TheRoot.com. ""Anybody who agrees to give any money to this wall is foolish."" Hundreds of different people could have said exactly the same thing, and have, almost word-for word. For the media, questioning the racism of President Trump’s border wall is like questioning gravity. If you want a wall, or any kind of secure border, you must be some kind of white supremacist.
 
What’s interesting about this argument – and again, you hear it everywhere - is how Orwellian this argument it is. Ask yourself: Who, exactly, supports unrestricted low-wage immigration? Who benefits most from it? If there’s any group in America that supports having more than 20 million people here illegally, it’s not our poor. It’s the people in our richest neighborhoods. Nobody else even comes close. If you made a chart, and let’s be honest here, you’d have to put rich, white people are the very top. Our endless supply of new immigrants gives them access to much cheaper household help -- nannies, housekeepers, gardeners, whatever. It makes the products they buy cheaper. Most of all, it makes them virtuous, like they’re helping the employees they exploit achieve the American dream. If there’s any group in America that supports having more than 20 million people here illegally, it’s not our poor. It’s the people in our richest neighborhoods. Nobody else even comes close. So what’s the flip side? Who gets hurt most by our new borderless country? Again, it’s not even close: African-Americans. Here’s Cornell economics professor Vernon Briggs, who said the following:
 
“Because most illegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work in the low skilled labor market and because the black American labor force is so disproportionately concentrated in this same low wage sector, there is little doubt that there is significant overlap in competition for jobs in this sector of the labor market,"" said Cornell economics professor Vernon Briggs. ""Given the inordinately high unemployment rates for low skilled black workers … it is obvious that the major loser in this competition are low skilled black workers.” Tucker Carlson Tonight – Monday, January 7Video
In other words -- and you already knew this and anybody who has thought about this for a second does --  low wage immigration is costing African-Americans jobs and money. Other studies have reached the same conclusion. It’s obviously true. And because it’s obviously true, that’s exactly why the people benefitting from it don’t want to have the conversation. It’s why they scream bigotry until you shut up.

Breitbart,"Border Patrol agents in South Texas discovered 30 illegal immigrants being smuggled in the back of a tractor-trailer at the Falfurrias Checkpoint. The find led to the arrest of men, women, and children who were placed into dangerous conditions in an attempt to sneak through the checkpoint located 80 miles from the Mexican border. Agents found eight more being smuggled in two pickup trucks that were allegedly driven by members of the same family. Agents assigned to the Falfurrias Border Patrol Checkpoint in the Rio Grande Valley Sector discovered a load of illegal immigrants after a K-9 alerted to suspicious cargo in the trailer. Following the early Saturday morning alert, the agents directed the driver of the 18-wheeler to move his rig to the secondary inspection station, Border Patrol officials said in a statement provided to OutletName Texas on Tuesday morning. An inspection of the trailer revealed 30 illegal immigrants hiding within the cargo of the truck. Officials said the load consisted of men, women, and children from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Mexico. The Rio Grande Valley Sector continuously leads the nation in the arrest of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) and Family Unit Aliens (FMUA), OutletName Texas reported. Agents arrested the driver and took the migrants into custody for processing for immigration violations. “These smuggling tactics continue to place immigrants in extreme danger,” Rio Grande Valley Sector Chief Patrol Agent Manuel Padilla, Jr. said in a written statement. “With summer approaching, we will continue to work with our local, state, and federal partners, as well as the community, to prevent senseless tragedies.” On March 26, a K-9 agent alerted to a Ford pickup truck that arrived at the Falfurrias Checkpoint. An inspection of the truck led to the discovery of an illegal immigrant in the cabin and three more hiding in a bed frame. A few minutes later, agents observed a Dodge truck approaching the same checkpoint. After a K-9 alerted, agents referred the driver to a secondary inspection station. The agents found two migrants hiding in the truck’s cabin and another two more hiding in a sofa in the back. Agents determined both drivers were from the same family and placed them both in custody. All three drivers are expected to be prosecuted on human smuggling charges. The illegal immigrants are being processed for immigration violations and will be turned over to immigration officials for processing. During FY 2018 (through February 28), RGV Sector agents arrested 9,729 illegal immigrants including 2,923 families and 1,406 unaccompanied minors.","border patrol agents in south texas discovered 30 illegal immigrants being smuggled in the back of a tractor - trailer at the falfurrias checkpoint. the find led to the arrest of men, women, and children who were placed into dangerous conditions in an attempt to sneak through the checkpoint located 80 miles from the mexican border. agents found eight more being smuggled in two pickup trucks that were allegedly driven by members of the same family. agents assigned to the falfurrias border patrol checkpoint in the rio grande valley sector discovered a load of illegal immigrants after a k - 9 alerted to suspicious cargo in the trailer. following the early saturday morning alert, the agents directed the driver of the 18 - wheeler to move his rig to the secondary inspection station, border patrol officials said in a statement provided to outletname texas on tuesday morning. an inspection of the trailer revealed 30 illegal immigrants hiding within the cargo of the truck. officials said the load consisted of men, women, and children from guatemala, honduras, el salvador, and mexico. the rio grande valley sector continuously leads the nation in the arrest of unaccompanied alien children ( uac ) and family unit aliens ( fmua ), outletname texas reported. agents arrested the driver and took the migrants into custody for processing for immigration violations. “ these smuggling tactics continue to place immigrants in extreme danger, ” rio grande valley sector chief patrol agent manuel padilla, jr. said in a written statement. “ with summer approaching, we will continue to work with our local, state, and federal partners, as well as the community, to prevent senseless tragedies. ” on march 26, a k - 9 agent alerted to a ford pickup truck that arrived at the falfurrias checkpoint. an inspection of the truck led to the discovery of an illegal immigrant in the cabin and three more hiding in a bed frame. a few minutes later, agents observed a dodge truck approaching the same checkpoint. after a k - 9 alerted, agents referred the driver to a secondary inspection station. the agents found two migrants hiding in the truck ’ s cabin and another two more hiding in a sofa in the back. agents determined both drivers were from the same family and placed them both in custody. all three drivers are expected to be prosecuted on human smuggling charges. the illegal immigrants are being processed for immigration violations and will be turned over to immigration officials for processing. during fy 2018 ( through february 28 ), rgv sector agents arrested 9, 729 illegal immigrants including 2, 92",1.87740370165e-05,0.49998128414154,0,421,4.75,3.8,4.75,1.9,0.48,2.61,5.23,3.09,0.71,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.95,0.0,0.48,0.0,0.0,0.24,12.35,0.71,0.0,0.48,0.71,0.0,0.48,4.28,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.61,14.73,2.38,8.79,1.43,0.0,0.0,3.33,5.23,0.48,1.19,6.413301662707839,7.1258907363420425,0.4750593824228029
Breitbart,"Sen. Tom Cotton’s (R-AR) strong influence over the national debate on immigration policy and President Trump’s administration has left Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) unwilling to broker an immigration deal unless the populist conservative Senator is left out of the conversation.
A POLITICO report revealed the level to which Cotton and his close ally Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) — both staunch pro-American immigration reformers who want to see legal immigration levels reduced to benefit American workers — have gotten under the skin of Schumer and Democrats.
When it comes to striking a deal between the Republican establishment, the “America First” wing of the Republican Party, Democrats, and the Trump administration on the issue of nearly 800,000 illegal aliens who have been shielded from deportation by the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Schumer allegedly told the president that he will not negotiate a deal if Cotton is involved.
The report stated:
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told President Trump this week that there will be no deal on Dreamers if hard-line conservative GOP Sen. Tom Cotton is involved, according to several congressional sources. Schumer also told the president that he was not being well served by White House staffers during negotiations over the fate of 700,000 young immigrants who face potential deportation if no deal is reached to protect them.
Schumer and Democrats, according to POLITICO, are greatly annoyed that Cotton and Perdue corrected the record on a White House meeting last week in which Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and others claimed Trump called African nations and El Salvador “shithole” countries.
“In regards to Senator Durbin’s accusation, we do not recall the President saying these comments specifically but what he did call out was the imbalance in our current immigration system, which does not protect American workers and our national interest,” Cotton and Perdue said in a statement.
Schumer and his open borders allies are also bugged by the fact that Cotton and Perdue — who introduced the Trump-endorsed, legal immigration-cutting RAISE Act last year — have been devoted to Trump’s popular pro-American immigration agenda.
Tom Cotton: ‘Not Nativist’ to Want Immigration Policy ‘Crafted to Benefit American Citizens, Not Foreigners’://t.co/mlY8XtSU4s — John Binder 👽 () December 26, 2017
That economic nationalist agenda includes an end to the process known as “chain migration” – whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. – as well as an end to the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which randomly gives out 50,000 visas every year to foreign nationals who win a lottery to permanently resettle in the U.S.
Unlike members of the Republican establishment, such as Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Cotton and Perdue have not caved in negotiations with Democrats on an immigration deal.
When an expansive amnesty plan by the “Gang of Six” — which includes Flake, Graham, Durbin, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO), Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) — was revealed this week, Cotton, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen shut the proposal down, blasting it for not including an end to chain migration, the Visa Lottery, and full funding for a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Might as well roll it straight into the trash can … mass amnesty far beyond DACA, fake border security, no end to chain migration. ://t.co/pkpCrJxXfa — Tom Cotton () January 17, 2018
Nothing in return: phantom border security, chain migration visas merely shifted temporarily among categories of relatives, & diversity lottery visas permanently locked in. And don't forget amnesty for 400k TPS recipients! ://t.co/k9vJ8gg5Wo — Tom Cotton () January 17, 2018
Cotton, seen as the heir to Sessions’ pro-American immigration agenda in the Senate, told POLITICO in an interview that the likely reason Schumer did not want him to be part of White House negotiations on immigration was “probably because I would get a good deal, and he wants a bad deal.”
Trump, Cotton, and Perdue have been successful in getting some members of the Republican establishment, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Graham, to oppose chain migration, which has imported more than nine million foreign nationals to the U.S. in the last decade, a figure that exceeds two years of American births and the population of New York City.
In an explosive report, OutletName News revealed that chain migration, if not ended, is expected to add between seven and eight million new foreign-born voters to the U.S. electorate – a scheme that favors Democrats as immigrants, specifically Hispanics and Asians, who vote 2-to-1 for Democrats over Republicans.
Nonetheless, chain migration and the Visa Lottery are overwhelmingly unpopular with the American people.
Poll: 60 Percent of Likely Voters Want to End ‘Visa Lottery’ Responsible for Importing NYC Terror Suspect ://t.co/Qk0pj5NxDZ — John Binder 👽 () January 4, 2018
In a new poll by Pulse Opinion Research, nearly 60 percent of likely voters want to see chain migration ended, while 60 percent also want to see the Visa Lottery program ended. That same poll showed that 60 percent of likely voters said legal immigration levels should be reduced to 500,000 admissions a year or even less – a plan that Trump, Cotton, and Perdue have championed.
Every year, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 43.7 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population. Mass immigration to the U.S. has kept American wages stagnant, while depressing job prospects for poor, working, and middle class communities.","sen. tom cotton ’ s ( r - ar ) strong influence over the national debate on immigration policy and president trump ’ s administration has left senate minority leader chuck schumer ( d - ny ) unwilling to broker an immigration deal unless the populist conservative senator is left out of the conversation. a politico report revealed the level to which cotton and his close ally sen. david perdue ( r - ga ) — both staunch pro - american immigration reformers who want to see legal immigration levels reduced to benefit american workers — have gotten under the skin of schumer and democrats. when it comes to striking a deal between the republican establishment, the “ america first ” wing of the republican party, democrats, and the trump administration on the issue of nearly 800, 000 illegal aliens who have been shielded from deportation by the president obama - created deferred action for childhood arrivals ( daca ) program, schumer allegedly told the president that he will not negotiate a deal if cotton is involved. the report stated : senate minority leader chuck schumer ( d - n. y. ) told president trump this week that there will be no deal on dreamers if hard - line conservative gop sen. tom cotton is involved, according to several congressional sources. schumer also told the president that he was not being well served by white house staffers during negotiations over the fate of 700, 000 young immigrants who face potential deportation if no deal is reached to protect them. schumer and democrats, according to politico, are greatly annoyed that cotton and perdue corrected the record on a white house meeting last week in which sen. dick durbin ( d - il ) and others claimed trump called african nations and el salvador “ shithole ” countries. “ in regards to senator durbin ’ s accusation, we don't recall the president saying these comments specifically but what he did call out was the imbalance in our current immigration system, which does not protect american workers and our national interest, ” cotton and perdue said in a statement. schumer and his open borders allies are also bugged by the fact that cotton and perdue — who introduced the trump - endorsed, legal immigration - cutting raise act last year — have been devoted to trump ’ s popular pro - american immigration agenda. tom cotton : ‘ not nativist ’ to want immigration policy ‘ crafted to benefit american citizens, not foreigners ’ : / / t. co / mly8xtsu4s — john binder ( ) december 26",0.645277678966522,0.145277678966523,0,385,1.82,1.56,9.09,1.56,0.26,7.27,6.49,0.78,0.52,0.52,1.56,0.0,3.64,0.0,0.26,0.0,0.26,0.0,12.73,0.0,0.26,0.0,1.3,0.26,0.52,5.45,0.26,0.0,1.04,0.0,0.0,0.26,0.0,0.0,0.52,1.04,7.53,1.3,5.45,1.04,0.0,0.26,2.86,4.16,2.86,1.04,7.772020725388601,9.844559585492227,0.2590673575129534
FoxNews,"President Trump lauded Washington Republicans’ successes last year and promised to build on that momentum with an ambitious 2018 agenda that includes rebuilding the military, achieving immigration reform and improving border security.
In a wide-ranging press conference from Camp David on Saturday, Trump also said he plans to campaign for GOP congressional candidates, and looks forward to perhaps improving relations with the rogue nation of North Korea in 2018.
“We are very well prepared for the coming year. We finished strong,” Trump said at his weekend political retreat at Camp David, in snow-covered western Maryland.
The president, in a roughly 20-minute-long press conference, also spoke about the ongoing special counsel investigation regarding whether Trump or his associates colluded with Russia during the 2016 White House race.
""Everything I've done is 100 percent proper,"" Trump said. ""That is what I do. I do things properly. … Just so you understand, there's been no collusion. There's been no crime.""
Trump also repeatedly said he and Republican leaders of the GOP-controlled Congress are eager to work with Democrats on a range of issues, even suggesting that they would postpone welfare reform without Democratic support.
However, he appeared to sharpen his hard line on bipartisan immigration reform, saying he won’t extend protection for young illegal immigrants under the expiring, Obama-era DACA program unless Democrats agree to fund his U.S.-Mexico wall as part of a comprehensive plan that includes strengthening American borders.
“I hope we are going to work out our agreements with the Democrats,” Trump said. But “we want the wall. The wall’s not going to happen, we’re not having DACA.”
He then reiterated his claims that Mexico would pay -- in some way -- for the wall along the border.
The president also spoke about stopping the flow of drugs into the United States, an issue that until Saturday did not appear to be at the forefront of his 2018 agenda.
“Drugs are pouring into the country,” he said. “I think we are going to put a big dent into that.”
Trump was joined at the press conference by congressional Republicans, Cabinet secretaries and White House aides.
“From a right-center point of view, 2017 was the most consequential year since I’ve been in Congress,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. “I’m excited about the new year. I’m excited to get to work.”
During the press conference, Trump expressed optimism about peace on the Korean Peninsula, where North Korean leader Kim Jung Un continues to pursue a nuclear weapon and an intercontinental missile on which to launch it.
He suggested the talks between North Korea and U.S. ally South Korea about the North joining the upcoming Olympic Games were “a start” toward potential de-escalation.
“If something can come out of those talks, that would be a great thing,” he said.
Trump said he would join the 2018 campaign trail for Republican candidates, saying “we are going to be very involved.”","president trump lauded washington republicans ’ successes last year and promised to build on that momentum with an ambitious 2018 agenda that includes rebuilding the military, achieving immigration reform and improving border security. in a wide - ranging press conference from camp david on saturday, trump also said he plans to campaign for gop congressional candidates, and looks forward to perhaps improving relations with the rogue nation of north korea in 2018. “ we are very well prepared for the coming year. we finished strong, ” trump said at his weekend political retreat at camp david, in snow - covered western maryland. the president, in a roughly 20 - minute - long press conference, also spoke about the ongoing special counsel investigation regarding whether trump or his associates colluded with russia during the 2016 white house race.

Daily Caller,"South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham wondered Sunday how President Donald Trump can negotiate an end to the partial government shutdown “as long as the radical left is in charge.”
Graham told OutletName’s “Face the Nation” that he doesn’t hold out much hope for a quick resolution to the impasse as long as Republicans are dealing with Democrats who are acting like fringe politicians.
“We’re having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], not support ICE. We’re having to negotiate with people who see border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers,” Graham said.
“ICE is not the problem, it’s the solution,” Graham told OutletName. “The goal is to repair a damaged, broken immigration system. It’s to implement policies Democrats have voted for in the past on President Trump’s watch.” “And we’re negotiating with people who will … accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racists. As long as the radical left is in charge, we’re not going to get anywhere,” he told the network.
Graham, who initially balked at supporting Trump’s candidacy to lead the Republican Party in the 2016 presidential election, has become one of the administration’s most loyal legislators. Graham defended Trump’s choice of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice and has even come around to Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, after some initial opposition.
“The president is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security,” Graham insisted. “The goal is to fix a broken immigration system.”
The government remains in a partial shutdown after three weeks of little progress between the president and a Democratic leadership that remains obdurate about not funding a border wall.
Newly reappointed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called the wall “immoral,” prompting the president to quip that she should also object to the wall around the Vatican.
“There is a deal to be had here, but it will include a wall,” Graham said. “And if there’s no wall in this deal, we’ll never have a deal.”","south carolina republican sen. lindsey graham wondered sunday how president donald trump can negotiate an end to the partial government shutdown “ as long as the radical left is in charge. ” graham told outletname ’ s “ face the nation ” that he doesn ’ t hold out much hope for a quick resolution to the impasse as long as republicans are dealing with democrats who are acting like fringe politicians. “ we ’ re having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ice [ immigration and customs enforcement ], not support ice. we ’ re having to negotiate with people who see border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers, ” graham said. “ ice is not the problem, it ’ s the solution, ” graham told outletname. “ the goal is to repair a damaged, broken immigration system. it ’ s to implement policies democrats have voted for in the past on president trump ’ s watch. ” “ and we ’ re negotiating with people who will … accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racists. as long as the radical left is in charge, we ’ re not going to get anywhere, ” he told the network. graham, who initially balked at supporting trump ’ s candidacy to lead the republican party in the 2016 presidential election, has become one of the administration ’ s most loyal legislators. graham defended trump ’ s choice of brett kavanaugh as a supreme court justice and has even come around to trump ’ s decision to withdraw u. s. troops from syria, after some initial opposition. “ the president is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security, ” graham insisted. “ the goal is to fix a broken immigration system. ” the government remains in a partial shutdown after three weeks of little progress between the president and a democratic leadership that remains obdurate about not funding a border wall. newly reappointed house speaker nancy pelosi has called the wall “ immoral, ” prompting the president to quip that she should also object to the wall around the vatican. “ there is a deal to be had here, but it will include a wall, ” graham said. “ and if there ’ s no wall in this deal, we ’ ll never have a deal. ”",2.36507021327e-05,0.499976396560669,0,371,0.81,3.5,10.51,2.7,1.35,6.74,6.47,1.35,0.81,1.08,1.08,0.0,2.43,0.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.02,0.0,0.0,0.27,0.54,0.27,0.27,3.23,0.54,0.27,0.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.54,0.81,10.24,0.27,9.7,0.54,0.0,0.0,3.23,2.96,3.5,1.35,5.3908355795148255,10.242587601078167,1.6172506738544474
FoxNews,"Valerie and her son took a walk around this city’s downtown area on Monday after spending three months on a treacherous trek from Brazil, through Central America to Texas. Valerie, a Congolese woman, fled her war-torn country with her family and is now trying to create a new life here. “We left the Congo because there weren’t any resources for us…my son has really liked it here. I’ve liked it here, as well. It’s for this reason I’ve come here to figure out my life, to improve my life,” she said in French. 
Valerie is one of hundreds of African migrants who arrived in San Antonio last week. City leaders said they weren’t given a heads up and quickly scrambled to accommodate them and quickly recruit several French-speaking volunteers who could serve as translators. “The City of San Antonio has received more than 200 individuals, mostly families and children. The families were released by the United States Customs and Border Patrol into the country with paperwork directing them to Portland, Maine,” said Interim Assistant City Manager Dr. Colleen Bridger. The majority of them stayed at Travis Park Church, which regularly hosts asylum seekers. “I’m not necessarily surprised…we react to changes on the border every day, we just had to figure out that process it didn't really shake us up too much,” said Gavin Rogers, associate pastor. It's not just Congolese migrants arriving in alarming numbers. Border Patrol agents reported arresting more than 500 people from Africa since May 30. The group included nationals from Angola, Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While Border Patrol has previously seen migrants from Africa, this is the first time they have seen such a large group crossing together. “It really has been a bit of an anomaly for us,” said Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. “I think most of them, you know, obviously are flying to different locations. And then, when they find themselves congregating in a location then they start to formulate a plan just south of the U.S. Mexican border here."" For years, people from the Congo and neighboring countries have fled to escape political instability and violence. According to the UN Refugee Agency, 4.5 million people from the DRC have been displaced. But the numbers seem to be increasing and officials in border towns are struggling to keep up. “Some [refugees] may have been traveling for months to get to the Mexico border in search of better opportunities that the U.S. has to offer, the human rights that the U.S. has to offer,” Bonita Sharma, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio’s College of Public Policy, told The Rivard Report. Unlike most Mexicans and Central Americans, many of the migrants from Africa don't have roots in America or families who can take them in once they are released from immigration detention. And many speak languages the immigration officials do not. “Quite often, the individuals from the African continent do not have a permanent address or a sponsor already in the U.S. And so you really just have to pinpoint an immigration court near where they think they are going to ultimately end up and hope that they report themselves in,” said Ortiz. Over the weekend, the city, along with Catholic Charities, worked with the asylum seekers to figure out their next destination as many arrived without designated host families and cities. “If we don't know exactly the best place to send the migrant community like the Congolese. We have to figure out what shelters are available around the nation, where's the best place for their community to go,” said Rogers. There was also concern that some of the migrants could carry diseases, as there is currently an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, Bridger quickly shut down those rumors, telling local reporters that the migrants go through multiple health screenings. ""It's a 21-day incubation period so it's really not possible that, if they were exposed to Ebola in the DRC, that now, six months later, they develop symptoms and infect us,"" Bridger said. By Monday, the majority of the migrants had left on buses, heading to cities where they may have friends or family members. The line outside the city’s Migrant Resource Center downtown had dwindled. But, if more come, Rogers said they’ll be ready. “We’re a church always willing to serve our neighbors,"" Rogers said. ""We'll continue to do so whether that's with migrants or the homeless or a new need that will crop up in the future.”","valerie and her son took a walk around this city ’ s downtown area on monday after spending three months on a treacherous trek from brazil, through central america to texas. valerie, a congolese woman, fled her war - torn country with her family and is now trying to create a new life here. “ we left the congo because there weren ’ t any resources for us … my son has really liked it here. i ’ ve liked it here, as well. it ’ s for this reason i ’ ve come here to figure out my life, to improve my life, ” she said in french. valerie is one of hundreds of african migrants who arrived in san antonio last week. city leaders said they weren ’ t given a heads up and quickly scrambled to accommodate them and quickly recruit several french - speaking volunteers who could serve as translators. “ the city of san antonio has received more than 200 individuals, mostly families and children. the families were released by the united states customs and border patrol into the country with paperwork directing them to portland, maine, ” said interim assistant city manager dr. colleen bridger. the majority of them stayed at travis park church, which regularly hosts asylum seekers. “ i ’ m not necessarily surprised … we react to changes on the border every day, we just had to figure out that process it didn't really shake us up too much, ” said gavin rogers, associate pastor. it's not just congolese migrants arriving in alarming numbers. border patrol agents reported arresting more than 500 people from africa since may 30. the group included nationals from angola, cameroon, the republic of the congo, and the democratic republic of the congo. while border patrol has previously seen migrants from africa, this is the first time they have seen such a large group crossing together. “ it really has been a bit of an anomaly for us, ” said del rio sector chief patrol agent raul ortiz. “ i think most of them, you know, obviously are flying to different locations. and then, when they find themselves congregating in a location then they start to formulate a plan just south of the u. s. mexican border here.

FoxNews,"In the span of just a few months, the idea of providing health care to illegal immigrants has morphed from a fringe, left-wing fancy to a plank of many 2020 Democrats' presidential campaigns -- but it’s a proposal that one study predicts would cost American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year. A standout moment of the June 27 Democratic primary debate was that of all the candidates on the stage raising their hands, signifying support for government health care plans including “undocumented” immigrants. Republicans and the White House have seized on that moment, with President Trump declaring it “the end of the race.” But with the campaign definitely not over, and a number of frontrunners now backing the policy, more attention is turning to how much it could cost to give millions of illegal immigrants health insurance. On Thursday, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a policy group that advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, published a study finding that the cost could be up to $23 billion a year. While candidates have not necessarily gone into detail about their plans, CIS cites an Atlantic survey that found that Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro would all provide “full benefits” to those in the country illegally. The CIS study estimated that 4.9 million illegal immigrants have incomes below 400 percent of the poverty line and also do not have insurance -- meaning they have incomes low enough to receive coverage via either Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act -- also known to many, particularly critics, as ObamaCare. The study estimates that if all income-eligible, uninsured illegal immigrants received subsidies under the ACA, then the cost to insure would be $22.6 billion, but with “likely enrollment” of 46 percent, the total cost would be perhaps $10.4 billion a year. It predicts that the average cost of a subsidized premium would be $4,637. If a mixed approach of ACA subsidies and Medicaid enrollment were used, the cost would dip to $19.6 billion with 100 percent enrollment, and $10.7 billion assuming “likely enrollment.” These numbers could change significantly if a more overarching health care overhaul is passed by a future Democratic White House and Congress. “Numbers aside, the fact that presidential candidates are advocating spending billions of dollars on people who are in the country illegally is significant in its own right,” the report concludes. “It suggests that allowing in large numbers of less-educated workers will inevitably generate significant political pressure to provide them access to social programs.” Extending health care to illegal immigrants could, however, be only one part of the cost to taxpayers of more generous social policies being pushed by Democrats. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was an early champion of left-favored policies now finding their way into 2020 Democratic platforms, recently introduced a new package of policies known as the “Just Society.” Among those bills is “The Embrace Act,” which would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as U.S. citizens and those in the country legally. ""Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual’s immigration status,” the bill reads. The bill defines a federal public benefit as: “any grant, contract, loan, professional license or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; and ... any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post-secondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit,or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.”","in the span of just a few months, the idea of providing health care to illegal immigrants has morphed from a fringe, left - wing fancy to a plank of many 2020 democrats'presidential campaigns - - but it ’ s a proposal that one study predicts would cost american taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year. a standout moment of the june 27 democratic primary debate was that of all the candidates on the stage raising their hands, signifying support for government health care plans including “ undocumented ” immigrants. republicans and the white house have seized on that moment, with president trump declaring it “ the end of the race. ” but with the campaign definitely not over, and a number of frontrunners now backing the policy, more attention is turning to how much it could cost to give millions of illegal immigrants health insurance. on thursday, the center for immigration studies ( cis ), a policy group that advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, published a study finding that the cost could be up to $ 23 billion a year. while candidates have not necessarily gone into detail about their plans, cis cites an atlantic survey that found that sens. bernie sanders, i - vt., kamala harris, d - calif., and elizabeth warren, d - mass. ; and former housing secretary julian castro would all provide “ full benefits ” to those in the country illegally. the cis study estimated that 4. 9 million illegal immigrants have incomes below 400 percent of the poverty line and also don't have insurance - - meaning they have incomes low enough to receive coverage via either medicaid or the affordable care act - - also known to many, particularly critics, as obamacare. the study estimates that if all income - eligible, uninsured illegal immigrants received subsidies under the aca, then the cost to insure would be $ 22. 6 billion, but with “ likely enrollment ” of 46 percent, the total cost would be perhaps $ 10. 4 billion a year. it predicts that the average cost of a subsidized premium would be $ 4, 637. if a mixed approach of aca subsidies and medicaid enrollment were used, the cost would dip to $ 19. 6 billion with 100 percent enrollment, and $ 10. 7 billion assuming “ likely enrollment. ” these numbers could change significantly if a more overarching health care overhaul is passed by a future democratic white house and congress. “ numbers aside, the fact that presidential candidates are advocating spending billions of dollars on people who are in",3.07535410684e-05,0.499969244003295,0,402,6.97,11.19,2.99,0.0,0.5,2.49,10.7,2.24,0.75,2.24,2.49,0.5,2.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.71,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75,2.99,5.22,0.0,1.74,1.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.5,5.97,1.24,3.98,0.5,0.0,0.0,3.73,2.49,2.49,1.49,3.722084367245657,10.173697270471465,1.9851116625310175

Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan's departure is not uncommon in a presidential transition. The head of the Transportation Security Administration, Peter Neffenger, also left in the transfer of power.

FoxNews,"The Pentagon will deploy 1,000 more troops to the southern border  week, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday afternoon.
The additional forces will bring the total to nearly 6,000 active-duty and National Guard personnel deployed in support of the Department of Homeland Security at the border with Mexico, one week after President Trump declared a state of emergency to free up funding for a promised border wall.
SOME 5,200 TROOPS DEPLOYING TO BORDER
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday the House will vote Tuesday to reject Trump’s national emergency when Congress returns  week. The president has promised to veto any such effort to undo his emergency declaration, which is also being challenged in the courts.
Trump wants to spend roughly $6 billion from the Pentagon budget, $2.5 billion from its drug interdiction program and $3.5 billion from the military construction bill, to pay for the wall.
For years, it has been the practice to request approval from Congress before reallocating Defense Department funds, the senior defense official said, but also told reporters a congressional sign-off is “not required.”
More than 5,000 U.S. active-duty forces were ordered to the southern border in late October ahead of the midterm elections, and as a caravan of thousands of migrants traveled up toward the U.S. from Central America.
Since then, the mission has been extended two times. Earlier this year, Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan said U.S. forces would remain on the border through the end of September, due to the painstaking work of laying more than 100 miles of barbed wire, and offering aviation, surveillance and other support.
So far, U.S. troops have strung roughly 70 miles of concertina wire, said the official.
“We’re laying down another 140 miles of concertina wire, about 30 percent done with that,” the official added.","the pentagon will deploy 1, 000 more troops to the southern border week, a senior u. s. defense official said friday afternoon. the additional forces will bring the total to nearly 6, 000 active - duty and national guard personnel deployed in support of the department of homeland security at the border with mexico, one week after president trump declared a state of emergency to free up funding for a promised border wall. some 5, 200 troops deploying to border house speaker nancy pelosi said friday the house will vote tuesday to reject trump ’ s national emergency when congress returns week. the president has promised to veto any such effort to undo his emergency declaration, which is also being challenged in the courts. trump wants to spend roughly $ 6 billion from the pentagon budget, $ 2. 5 billion from its drug interdiction program and $ 3. 5 billion from the military construction bill, to pay for the wall. for years, it has been the practice to request approval from congress before reallocating defense department funds, the senior defense official said, but also told reporters a congressional sign - off is “ not required. ” more than 5, 000 u. s. active - duty forces were ordered to the southern border in late october ahead of the midterm elections, and as a caravan of thousands of migrants traveled up toward the u. s. from central america. since then, the mission has been extended two times. earlier this year, acting defense secretary pat shanahan said u. s. forces would remain on the border through the end of september, due to the painstaking work of laying more than 100 miles of barbed wire, and offering aviation, surveillance and other support. so far, u. s. troops have strung roughly 70 miles of concertina wire, said the official. “ we ’ re laying down another 140 miles of concertina wire, about 30 percent done with that, ” the official added.",0.270064622163772,0.229935407638549,0,315,7.3,7.94,10.16,1.27,1.27,7.62,6.35,0.0,1.27,0.95,1.27,0.63,2.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.32,0.63,0.63,4.13,1.59,0.0,0.32,0.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.52,1.59,8.89,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.3,4.44,1.9,1.59,5.396825396825397,8.88888888888889,1.2698412698412698
CNN,"After immigration authorities rounded up hundreds of workers in a massive sweep at seven Mississippi food processing plants, friends and family members are desperately searching for answers. A crowd waited Thursday morning outside a plant in Morton, Mississippi, hoping authorities would release their loved ones. Many had been released by the afternoon. Children sobbed as they waited for word on what had happened to their parents, video footage from OutletName affiliates and Facebook Live showed. In Forest, Mississippi, strangers and neighbors volunteered to take children with nowhere to go after their parents were detained to a local gym for the night, according to OutletName affiliate WJTV. Volunteers distributed donated food and drinks. But most children sobbed rather than ate, according to WJTV. “I need my dad … he’s not a criminal,” one little girl cried as she spoke with the network outside the gym. “I understand the law and how everything works and how everything has a system. But everyone needs to hold the kids first and foremost in their minds,” gym owner Jordan Barnes told WJTV. “And that’s what we’ve tried to do here, just give them a place to stay.” Hours later, all the kids had been reunited with family members, Barnes told OutletName, and the gym was set to resume normal operations. But a parking lot near the plant in Morton was packed with people Thursday who said their lives were frozen as they waited for news following Wednesday’s raids. Hours had passed since the time when they thought more busloads of immigrants released from custody would be coming. Over and over, they asked for the time, worried with each passing hour that their loved ones were headed to immigrant detention centers instead of coming home. “It’s exhausting, really. … I couldn’t even hold back my tears, and I don’t really cry. But it was just heartbreaking watching all of this,” said a woman who gave her name only as Maria and said she was trying to help people locate detained family members. Brittany Reynoso said she came to the parking lot in case members of her church had gotten caught up in the raid. She wanted them to see a familiar face if they were released from custody. “It’s definitely a ghost town. It is so empty. I’ve never seen Morton or Forest or any of the surrounding areas look so empty during the day,” she said. “It is horrible. And I honestly don’t think these communities will make it without them, because they really and truly are the backbone of what’s keeping this town afloat.” Reverend: ‘Terror hit’ when children were at school
Authorities hailed Wednesday’s sweep at food processing plants in six cities as a record-setting operation. At least 680 undocumented immigrants were detained. More than 300 of them had been released by Thursday, Bryan D. Cox, an ICE spokesman, said in a statement. Eighteen juveniles were found working at the plants, according to Jere Miles, special agent in charge for the Department of Homeland Security. Nine were released and not taken for processing, Miles said. One was 14 years old, he said. At least 377 migrants were still in custody Thursday, Miles said. The arrests came as a result of administrative and criminal search warrants executed by special agents from Homeland Security Investigations, federal officials said. “Today, through the hard work of these men and women, we are once again becoming a nation of laws,” US Attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi Mike Hurst said Wednesday as he announced the arrests. Immigrant rights advocates, religious leaders and local officials sharply criticized the raids, noting that a number of children returned to empty homes after the arrests, which occurred on the first day of school. “Our brothers and sisters, our fellow citizens – 6 years old, 5 years old, 7 years old, 11 years old – they left to go to school yesterday, excited about education, and terror hit them while they were gone,” said the Rev. James Evans, a co-founder of the Mississippi Immigrant Rights Alliance. Raids are a ‘gross display of humanity,’ mayor says
At a news conference denouncing the raids, Evans and other leaders urged Mississippi residents to stand together and support each other. Advocates shared a hotline for anyone directly impacted by the raids. Luis Espinoza, an organizer with the alliance, teared up as he described seeing detained workers and said the immigrants who were detained are in need of legal and financial assistance. “I don’t see illegals. I don’t see bad people. It’s only families, fathers, mothers who want something better for the kids, so they come here and just work,” he said. “They are not criminals.” Speaking to reporters outside a plant in Canton, Mississippi, Mayor William Truly Jr. said he was concerned about the impact the arrests would have on the local economy – and on the community. “I recognize that ICE comes under the Department of Homeland Security, and this is an order of the United States. There’s nothing, I don’t think, anybody can do about it,” he said. “But my main concern is now, what happens to the children?” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba called the raids “a gross display of humanity to me as a parent.” “As a father of two young girls, to imagine children arriving after their first day of school to a condition where their parents are gone from their lives, I think that we truly have to question where the soul of our nation is at this point and time,” he told WJTV on Thursday. Jackson is 40 miles west of Morton. ICE Acting Director Matt Albence told reporters Wednesday that some parents would be released with GPS ankle monitors and allowed to go to back to their homes as their immigration proceedings continued. In the past, he said, the agency has worked with school liaisons to help “find placement” for children when their parents are detained. “Each case depends on the individual circumstance. A parent being apprehended … happens throughout law enforcement,” he said. “You go out to any jurisdiction, state, local or otherwise, and they make an arrest of somebody, and that individual is a parent, that individual is going to go to jail, and that child’s going to be left alone or with a family member.” Busloads of immigrants dropped off
Outside the Morton plant on Wednesday, an 11-year-old girl sobbed and begged an officer for a chance to see her mom as bystanders tried to comfort her. “Please, can I just see my mother?” the girl cried out in video broadcast live on Facebook. Elizabeth Iraheta told OutletName she shared the video so people would see what was happening at the plant, where she said she’s worked legally for 19 years. It was devastating, Iraheta said, to see family and friends suffering “just for coming to work hard in this country, and to see so many families separated.” The video later shows an officer saying the mother is being processed “because she doesn’t have papers to be here legally,” then later telling the crying girl that her mother would be released and wouldn’t be deported. Hours later, witnesses said, the girl’s mother was released. Videos shared on social media showed busloads of immigrants returning to one plant’s parking lot early Thursday as onlookers cheered. One witness said she thought about 20 people had been released from custody. Authorities haven’t publicly spoken about what sites were targeted, citing a pending criminal investigation. They’ve also declined to answer questions about whether any employers had been arrested or would face charges. ICE used confidential informants employed at several of the raided food processing plants to identify managers or supervisors who knew they were hiring undocumented workers, a senior immigration official with knowledge of the investigation told OutletName. In some cases, immigration enforcement received audio and video recordings. OutletName has reached out to the food processing plants for comment. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has stepped up worksite enforcement since President Donald Trump took office, conducting a number of large-scale raids at food-processing plants and gardening centers. “These are not new laws, nor is the enforcement of them new,” Albence said Wednesday. “The arrests today were the result of a yearlong criminal investigation.

HuffPost,"President Donald Trump again lashed OutletName correspondent Jim Acosta during a roundtable at the White House on Friday, mockingly thanking the reporter for his “sales pitch” for the president’s border wall.
Trump was referring to Acosta’s report Thursday showing that nothing was happening along an empty, quiet stretch of the Mexico-Texas border during Trump’s visit, which was intended to highlight the “invasion” there. Trump and some other Republicans mocked the report, pointing out that Acosta was walking along a border fence during his report.
“Good job. I appreciate your sales pitch,” Trump said Friday in a jab at Acosta.
When Acosta answered: “I didn’t see an invasion at the border,” Trump shot back: “Oh, you didn’t? That’s because we had a wall.” While there are about 650 miles of barriers along the southern border, construction of Trump’s border wall has not begun.
Acosta tweeted about Trump’s new claim of an invasion: “Fact check: False.”
Trump again said today the country is being invaded down at the border. Fact check: False. — Jim Acosta () January 11, 2019
Trump said during his comments that said the nation is “under siege” by immigrants attempting to cross the border. “We have a country that’s being invaded by criminals and drugs,” he said.
The president also insisted that his threat to declare a national emergency — and build a border wall without support from Congress or the majority of Americans — would be the “easy way out.” But “Congress should do this” — apparently meaning the House and Senate should agree to his demands. “It’s too simple,” he said.
“If they can’t do it, I will declare a national emergency. I have the absolute right to do it,” Trump added.
But Trump appeared to back further away from his threat to declare a national emergency in other comments.
“What we’re not looking to do right now is national emergency,” Trump said. “I’m not going to do it so fast.”","president donald trump again lashed outletname correspondent jim acosta during a roundtable at the white house on friday, mockingly thanking the reporter for his “ sales pitch ” for the president ’ s border wall. trump was referring to acosta ’ s report thursday showing that nothing was happening along an empty, quiet stretch of the mexico - texas border during trump ’ s visit, which was intended to highlight the “ invasion ” there. trump and some other republicans mocked the report, pointing out that acosta was walking along a border fence during his report. “ good job. i appreciate your sales pitch, ” trump said friday in a jab at acosta. when acosta answered : “ i didn ’ t see an invasion at the border, ” trump shot back : “ oh, you didn ’ t? that ’ s because we had a wall. ” while there are about 650 miles of barriers along the southern border, construction of trump ’ s border wall has not begun. acosta tweeted about trump ’ s new claim of an invasion : “ fact check : false. ” trump again said today the country is being invaded down at the border. fact check : false. — jim acosta ( ) january 11, 2019 trump said during his comments that said the nation is “ under siege ” by immigrants attempting to cross the border. “ we have a country that ’ s being invaded by criminals and drugs, ” he said. the president also insisted that his threat to declare a national emergency — and build a border wall without support from congress or the majority of americans — would be the “ easy way out. ” but “ congress should do this ” — apparently meaning the house and senate should agree to his demands. “ it ’ s too simple, ” he said. “ if they can ’ t do it, i will declare a national emergency. i have the absolute right to do it, ” trump added. but trump appeared to back further away from his threat to declare a national emergency in other comments. “ what we ’ re not looking to do right now is national emergency, ” trump said. “ i ’ m not going to do it so fast. ”",0.97430270910263,0.474302753806114,1,334,0.9,1.5,6.29,0.9,0.0,5.39,7.19,0.9,0.6,1.2,0.9,0.0,3.29,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.07,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.4,0.0,0.6,2.4,0.6,0.0,0.3,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,14.67,0.9,10.48,1.8,0.3,0.0,5.09,5.39,2.4,0.9,5.688622754491018,7.48502994011976,0.29940119760479045
CNN,"Thousands rallied in Washington Saturday less than a week before President-elect Donald Trump takes office to make clear their opposition to his policies on immigration and social justice.

At the other event, a march organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network and more than a dozen other groups, speakers criticized Trump's nomination of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions to lead the Justice Department, fearing that he will reverse Obama administration policies on civil rights.

CNN,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday designed to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities -- setting up a showdown with immigration advocates.
The order will ""strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants,"" according to press secretary Sean Spicer.
The order declares that entities labeled ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" by the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security will be ""not eligible"" for federal grants, and it directs the Office of Management and Budget to compile federal grant money currently going to sanctuary jurisdictions.
Already, some mayors have made clear they're standing firm. At a news conference just moments after Trump's executive order was announced, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said his city wouldn't budge.
""I haven't read the content of the sanctuary city (order), but I want to make very clear, we are going to stay a sanctuary city. We welcome, just as in the spirit of what Cardinal (Blase) Cupich talked about, 'there is no stranger among us,'"" Emanuel said.
But what is a sanctuary city? And can Trump really defund them?
Here's a look at what the term means and its implications in immigration policy under Trump.
What is a sanctuary city?
The term ""sanctuary city"" is a broad term applied to jurisdictions that have policies in place designed to limit cooperation with or involvement in federal immigration enforcement actions. Cities, counties and some states have a range of informal policies as well as actual laws that qualify as ""sanctuary"" positions.
Most of the policies center around not cooperating with federal law enforcement on immigration policies. Many of the largest cities in the country have forms of such policies.
In 2015, more than 200 state and local jurisdictions did not honor requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain individuals, ICE Director Sarah Saldaña testified before Congress, and a subset of that group refused to give access to their jails and prisons to ICE.
According to tracking by the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates for restricting immigration and opposes sanctuary policies, roughly 300 sanctuary jurisdictions rejected more than 17,000 detention requests, between January 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015.
The idea for sanctuary cities appears to have sprung out of churches in the 1980s that provide sanctuary to Central Americans fleeing violence at home amid reluctance by the federal government to grant them refugee status. They became popular in more diverse locales to counter what officials there saw as overzealous federal immigration policies, particularly against those arrested for minor, non-violent crimes.
How does it work?
There is no single definition for a sanctuary city.
For example, the Los Angeles Police Department said after November's election that it would continue its policy of not allowing police to stop people solely to establish their immigration status, according to the OutletName.
""San Francisco is a sanctuary city and will not waiver in its commitment to protect the rights of all its residents,"" San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee said earlier this month upon announcing an expansion to a city fund to provide legal services to the immigrant community, documented or otherwise.
Chicago has set up a similar fund, as has Los Angeles, and they're under consideration in other major cities, like New York.
""Chicago has in the past been a sanctuary city,"" Emanuel said in November, according to the Sun-Times. ""It always will be a sanctuary city.""
Emanuel also referenced Chicago's ""Welcoming City Ordinance,"" a collection of laws similar to others around the country that make clear Chicago will not help investigate the citizenship status of individuals unless mandated by law or a court, will not discriminate issuing city services depending on citizenship and will not cooperate with immigration detentions.
And 12 states and the District of Columbia have laws allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
The goal of the constellation of informal and formal policies is generally to protect undocumented immigrants who are not otherwise engaged in criminal activity from being detained or deported.
Who objects to these practices?
Some conservatives have opposed these policies for years, as they have sought tougher immigration laws that crack down on undocumented immigrants living in the US.
Trump made the issue a centerpiece of his campaign, at one time saying he would support a deportation force to round up all the millions of immigrants living in the US illegally. He has since backed off that position, with his surrogates saying his administration will prioritize removing criminals.
As major urban centers tend to be run by Democratic politicians, who support more forgiving immigration policies, many cities have been locked in battles with Republican leaders nationally over the policies.
ICE has also said the policies inhibit their ability to enforce immigration laws.
Opponents of sanctuary cities also often cite cases of crimes perpetrated or allegedly perpetrated by undocumented immigrants.
In one of the most emotionally charged challenges to sanctuary cities, the parents of Kate Steinle, a young woman who was allegedly fatally shot by an undocumented immigrant recently released from jail, attempted to sue San Francisco over its sanctuary city policy. The lawsuit claimed the sheriff and city were partly to blame for her death.
A judge ruled this month, however, dismissing the claim.
Still, Steinle's 2015 murder has been a rallying cry for opponents of sanctuary cities and those who seek tougher immigration policies.
What role does federal money play?
The order appears to apply mostly to future federal grants, though after OMB's review, Spicer explained that the funding identified could be taken away.
While the administration likely can't cut off all federal funding, as much of it is disbursed through Congress, the President could put some pressure on cities this way.
Aside from congressionally provided funds, there are a number of grants administered by federal agencies that could mean big money lost to cities and states.
One such program is the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, administered by the Department of Justice, points out Hans von Spakovsky, a legal and immigration expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation who advocates for policies like those implemented by Trump.
That fund alone allocated $274.9 million in 2016, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and the five states with the most allocations were California, at $30.5 million; Texas, at $21.4 million; Florida, with $17.8 million; New York, with $15.6 million; and Illinois, at $10.4 million.
Wouldn't that create a legal issue?
The move, when finalized, will almost certainly generate court challenges.
The courts have held in the past that the federal government can only strip funding that is related to the policy involved -- so it's unlikely to hold up if the administration tried to take away highway funds, for example, according to experts. The courts have also ruled that funding decisions may not be used to ""coerce"" states into actions.
But something like the JAG program, which supports law enforcement, might be considered germane to the issue.
In South Dakota v. Dole , the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 on Congress using highway funds to enforce a national drinking age, upheld past case law that federal grant restrictions may not pass muster ""if they are unrelated 'to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs,'"" and most also be to promote ""general welfare."" That ruling specifically applied to Congress, but would certainly be cited in any litigation over Trump's order.
And in a more recent case brought by conservatives against President Barack Obama's health care law, the Supreme Court held in 2012 that withholding Medicaid funds from states that did not cooperate was ""coercion,"" and thus unconstitutional.
Another case written by a conservative icon, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, is also cited as a possible defense for sanctuary cities. In Printz v. US , a case on gun rights, Scalia wrote, citing case law: ""The Federal Government may not compel the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.""
The matter will likely end up in the courts -- as did many of Obama's immigration executive actions.
""It's a gray area how far the federal government can go in basically engaging in what some might call coercive behavior using federal money as an angle, but that would make for a very spirited, interesting litigation fight, and in the vast majority of these cases, the federal government has won,"" von Spakovsky said in an interview before the executive orders were issued.","president donald trump signed an executive order wednesday designed to crack down on so - called sanctuary cities - - setting up a showdown with immigration advocates. the order will "" strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants, "" according to press secretary sean spicer. the order declares that entities labeled "" sanctuary jurisdictions "" by the secretary of the department of homeland security will be "" not eligible "" for federal grants, and it directs the office of management and budget to compile federal grant money currently going to sanctuary jurisdictions. already, some mayors have made clear they're standing firm. at a news conference just moments after trump's executive order was announced, chicago mayor rahm emanuel said his city wouldn't budge.

Breitbart,"Democrat Presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris spoke at a rally at UC Irvine Wednesday, calling on Congress to pass a “clean” DACA amnesty bill, with no enforcement measures attached. The Orange County Register reports the freshman Senator from California, a favorite among progressives for 2020, addressed a crowd of approximately 200 supporters characterizing President Trump’s criterion for reforming DACA as “mean-spirited:” “This is about a fight for the future of this country, believing in the values upon which this country was founded,” Harris said. … “The path right now is rocky. It is difficult. It is hard,” Harris said. “We are witnessing things that we can only describe as awful and wrong, and mean-spirited. But that’s OK … Because we know this is about doing the right thing. We know this is about all the young people, who were brought here, some before they could walk or talk.” Harris was loudly cheered by the heavily immigrant crowd of roughly 200, while about 15 counter-demonstrators shouted their opposition to new provisions for those in the country illegally as well as their opposition to Harris. Harris is “clearly seen as an ally by most on hand Wednesday, including the clergy, faculty and DACA students — a blend of Koreans and Latinos,” according to the OC Register. The event was choreographed to pressure the region’s Rep. Mimi Walters, R-Laguna Beach, to sign on and co-sponsor the current version of the Dream Act introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R- S.C., and Richard Durbin, D-Ill. Harris touted her co-sponsorship of the measure, which purports to give “permanent legal status to those covered by DACA and a path to citizenship for those in college, the military or who are otherwise employed.” Her message resonated with those present according to the OC Register article, sparking similar expressions of personal outrage at Trump’s ideas on immigration and particularly DACA reform: “We did not migrate to this country to sabotage this land, but to prosper with it,” said Ming Jun “Jenny” Park, a DACA recipient and fourth-year psychological major. While other leading Democrats including Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a joint statement flatly dismissing all Trump’s reform “principles”, they claim they’re open to “reasonable border security measures.” Pelosi was shouted down at her own event last month in her native San Francisco by hardcore progressives and open-border socialists when she expressed essentially the same position about border security—which the activists consider “selling out.”  To this rising hard left socialist movement, which goes by names like “Indivisible”, any acknowledgment of the border is tantamount to endorsing oppression. This forced Pelosi to step up her anti-Trump rhetoric as she doubled down at a Capitol Hill press event Wednesday: They call them principles — unprinciples! —  they are not principles, they are trash — are unacceptable to the dreamers and those of us who fight for them. Trump’s “principles?” OutletName News summarized Trump’s goal using the President’s own words: Immigration reform must create more jobs, higher wages, and greater security for Americans — now and for future generations.  The reforms outlined in the enclosure are necessary to ensure prosperity, opportunity, and safety for every member of our national family.","democrat presidential hopeful sen. kamala harris spoke at a rally at uc irvine wednesday, calling on congress to pass a “ clean ” daca amnesty bill, with no enforcement measures attached. the orange county register reports the freshman senator from california, a favorite among progressives for 2020, addressed a crowd of approximately 200 supporters characterizing president trump ’ s criterion for reforming daca as “ mean - spirited : ” “ this is about a fight for the future of this country, believing in the values upon which this country was founded, ” harris said. … “ the path right now is rocky. it is difficult. it is hard, ” harris said. “ we are witnessing things that we can only describe as awful and wrong, and mean - spirited. but that ’ s ok … because we know this is about doing the right thing. we know this is about all the young people, who were brought here, some before they could walk or talk. ” harris was loudly cheered by the heavily immigrant crowd of roughly 200, while about 15 counter - demonstrators shouted their opposition to new provisions for those in the country illegally as well as their opposition to harris. harris is “ clearly seen as an ally by most on hand wednesday, including the clergy, faculty and daca students — a blend of koreans and latinos, ” according to the oc register. the event was choreographed to pressure the region ’ s rep. mimi walters, r - laguna beach, to sign on and co - sponsor the current version of the dream act introduced by sens. lindsey graham, r - s. c., and richard durbin, d - ill. harris touted her co - sponsorship of the measure, which purports to give “ permanent legal status to those covered by daca and a path to citizenship for those in college, the military or who are otherwise employed. ” her message resonated with those present according to the oc register article, sparking similar expressions of personal outrage at trump ’ s ideas on immigration and particularly daca reform : “ we did not migrate to this country to sabotage this land, but to prosper with it, ” said ming jun “ jenny ” park, a daca recipient and fourth - year psychological major. while other leading democrats including senate leader chuck schumer and house democratic leader nancy pelosi issued a joint statement flatly dismissing all trump ’ s reform “ principles ”, they claim they ’ re open to “ reasonable border security measures. ” pelosi was shouted down at her own event last",0.0001688313641352,0.499831199645996,0,395,1.27,1.77,6.08,1.77,0.51,4.05,7.09,1.77,0.76,0.76,1.27,0.25,2.78,1.01,0.51,0.0,0.25,0.0,11.9,0.0,0.25,0.76,0.0,0.25,0.25,4.3,0.0,0.51,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,7.09,0.76,4.56,0.51,0.76,0.51,3.29,3.29,3.29,0.76,5.5696202531645564,9.620253164556962,1.2658227848101267
Breitbart,"A Texas woman was sentenced to six years in federal prison and a nearly $800,000 fine after she was convicted of harboring two illegal aliens, forcing them to work as maids without pay.
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency announced that Olga Sandra Murra, 64, of Fort Worth, was sentenced and expected to pay $795,000 in restitution to her victims, both of which are illegal aliens.
Murra was convicted on two counts of forced labor and two counts of harboring illegal aliens after threatening her two victims with deportation and subsequently forcing them to work.
Murra, a Mexican immigrant herself, moved to Forth Worth in 1997, bringing one of her victims with her, along with other family members. The following year, Murra arranged for her other victim to be brought into the U.S. illegally.
Between September 1997 and April 2011, Murra kept either one of both victims at her residences in Fort Worth or in El Paso. During this time period, Murra forced both victims to work for her cleaning business, in which she forced them to hand all of their earnings over to her by threatening to call immigration officials on them. The victims would work up to seven days a week sometimes and cleaned nearly three to four homes a day. Murra also ordered the illegal aliens to cook food for her at her own residence.
At some point, Murra presented herself as a religious figure to the women, making them listen to voice recordings of her reading Bible verses and told them that if they did not obey her, they would go to hell. Murra allegedly hit one of the victims and threatened the other.
Murra restricted their bathroom use and food intake to bread and water. The victims would be punished by being forced to sleep in the backyard or garage.
Murra also forced one of her victims to work at McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, aside from working at her cleaning business, continuing to take all of the victims’ earnings.
The case was investigated by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) division and prosecuted by Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Allen-McCoy and Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Wirmani.

NYTimes,"From the early days of the Trump administration, Mayor Bill de Blasio proclaimed that he would defend the residents of New York from the newly aggressive immigration authorities, “regardless of where they come from, regardless of their immigration status.” A year later, the federal government has ratcheted up its attacks against so-called sanctuary cities like New York — including Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco — threatening to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding for law enforcement programs and detaining growing numbers of undocumented residents. Cities faced a Friday deadline to prove their cooperation with the immigration authorities, as the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, known as ICE, continued making arrests. Nationwide, the number of arrests in 2017 increased 41 percent from the year before. In New York, where some 500,000 residents are undocumented, if ICE wants to arrest somebody, it can. “Putting a bubble over a city where ICE can’t penetrate is not possible,” said Camille Mackler, the legal policy director of the New York Immigration Coalition, an activist group. “People think ‘sanctuary city’ — that you’re able to walk freely without fear. That’s not the case.” ICE agents have been appearing in New York’s courthouses and at people’s front doors, and, according to immigrant advocates, even entered a Manhattan church with a Spanish-speaking immigrant congregation. While the New York Police Department does not generally hand over detainees to ICE, it does, through a bureaucratic backdoor, essentially provide a road map: Arrest information is sent to the state, which shares it with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ICE can now see that information. “It’s hardly a sanctuary,” said Muzaffar Chishti, the director of the Migration Policy Institute’s office at New York University School of Law. “The mayor of the City of New York does not hide people under his desk. We’re fully cooperating with ICE. People get deported from New York all the time.” Immigration arrests of residents without criminal records more than tripled in New York after President Trump took office. Of the 2,976 arrests in 2017, 899 were of people without criminal convictions, up from 250 out of 1,762 in 2016, according to ICE statistics. Under the Obama administration, undocumented immigrants without criminal records were not priorities for deportation. Mr. de Blasio often says that the term “sanctuary city” is misinterpreted: It is a policy intended to make undocumented victims or witnesses feel safe to report crimes to the police without fear of immigration repercussions. To that end, New York does not deputize police officers to carry out immigration laws, under a policy known as 287g, which Mr. Trump has strongly supported. Since 2014, the city has declined to honor what are known as detainers — requests by ICE to hold undocumented immigrants who have been charged or convicted of crimes for 48 hours past their release dates so that immigration agents can pick them up. The city also removed immigration authorities from the Rikers Island jail complex where they had easy access to prisoners when they were released. “It forces them to go to inconvenient and costly routes to get to their target,” Mr. Chishti said. New York’s detainer law, however, has exceptions: The police must turn over a person convicted of one of 170 serious crimes within the last five years — including arson, homicide, rape or robbery — and in cases in which a judge has signed a detainer request. What to Know About the Trump Investigations
Card 1 of 6
Numerous inquiries. Since leaving office, former President Donald J. Trump has been facing several investigations into his business dealings and political activities. Here is a look at some notable cases: Classified documents inquiry. The F.B.I. searched Mr. Trump’s Florida home as part of the Justice Department’s investigation into his handling of classified materials. The inquiry is focused on documents that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, when he left the White House. Jan. 6 investigations. In a series of public hearings, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack laid out a comprehensive narrative of Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This evidence could allow federal prosecutors, who are conducting a parallel criminal investigation, to indict Mr. Trump. Georgia election interference case. Fani T. Willis, the Atlanta-area district attorney, has been leading a wide-ranging criminal investigation into the efforts of Mr. Trump and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia. This case could pose the most immediate legal peril for the former president and his associates. New York State’s civil case. Letitia James, the New York attorney general, has accused Mr. Trump, his family business and his three adult children of lying to lenders and insurers, fraudulently inflating the value of his assets. The allegations, included in a sweeping lawsuit, are the culmination of a yearslong civil investigation. Manhattan criminal case. Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, has been investigating whether, among other things, Mr. Trump or his family business intentionally submitted false property values to potential lenders. As a result of the inquiry, the Trump Organization was convicted on Dec. 6 of tax fraud and other crimes. ICE issued 1,526 detainer requests to the New York Police Department in the 2017 fiscal year, up from 80 in 2016. The Police Department complied with none of them. By its own policy, ICE does not enter places of worship, schools and hospitals. But courthouses have become frequent sites of arrests because they offer a degree of control that agents would not have when going to people’s homes. “Because courthouse visitors are typically screened upon entry to search for weapons and other contraband, the safety risks for the arresting officers and for the arrestee inside such a facility are substantially diminished,” ICE said in a statement. According to the Immigrant Defense Project, a nonprofit organization that is tracking arrests at city and state courthouses, 87 arrests were made in New York City courts in 2017, compared with six in 2016. So far, this year, there have been 13 courthouse arrests. Aboubacar Dembele, 27, was one. He was surrounded by immigration agents moments after stepping out of a hearing in Bronx Criminal Court. Mr. Dembele, an undocumented immigrant from the Ivory Coast, had pleaded not guilty to an assault charge stemming from a fight on a city bus in December; the judge had reduced the charge to a misdemeanor from a felony, and had set a follow-up court date to address the charges. Instead, Mr. Dembele is awaiting deportation at the Hudson County Correctional Facility in Kearny, N.J. “The way that they come and ambush people is outrageous,” said his lawyer, Monica Dula, of the Legal Aid Society of New York. Mr. Dembele was placed on ICE’s radar because of his arrest; his court appearance was public record. In January, ICE clarified its policy to say that it would not arrest family members or witnesses. Actions inside courthouses, it said, would be against “targeted aliens with criminal convictions, gang members, national security or public safety threats.” “The public is led to believe that ICE is pulling out dangerous individuals,” the Brooklyn district attorney, Eric Gonzalez, said at a news conference to denounce ICE’s courthouse actions. He added that low-level offenders are more often being arrested. “There is a chilling effect on our noncitizen and immigrant populations.” As he spoke, ICE agents were in a Brooklyn courthouse to pick up a defendant. The judge postponed the case when the man’s lawyer, Roger Asmar, told her that his client was afraid to appear. Mr. Gonzalez has instructed prosecutors to bring lesser charges against immigrants accused of low-level offenses so as not to trigger deportations or affect their immigration applications, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., has declined to prosecute most people arrested for evading the fare on the subways. Mr. de Blasio has come out against that idea, however, for public-safety reasons. The city, which has provided a municipal ID card often used by undocumented residents, has also allocated $47.5 million for immigrant legal services this year. To the ire of some immigrant activists, Mr. de Blasio said the money could not be used to aid undocumented immigrants convicted of the serious crimes defined by the detainer law. The New York City Bar Association wrote him a letter claiming “it was fundamentally unfair” to deny people legal help, including those eligible for a complex form of relief for victims of domestic violence or unaccompanied minors. Last summer, Mr. de Blasio eliminated city money for that same class of immigrants in deportation proceedings. The City Council secured private funding to keep representing clients who fell into this category. At times, it seems that Mr. de Blasio’s fierce rhetoric has given some immigrants an inflated sense of security. In December, two ICE officers entered the downstairs lobby of Saint Peter’s Church in Midtown Manhattan that houses a Spanish-speaking congregation, La Iglesia de Sion, according to the Rev. Amandus J. Derr, a pastor at Saint Peter’s. Father Derr escorted the two men from the building. An official for ICE said it could not confirm that the officers were from the enforcement agency. The incident left the congregation rattled and its numbers depleted. One member attending a recent Sunday Mass, Angela Carvajal, 49, relayed her fears. “I hope the mayor will do something about this,” she said in Spanish. Her friend, Alicia Garcia-Fuentes, 40, added, “Isn’t he supposed to protect the undocumented?”","from the early days of the trump administration, mayor bill de blasio proclaimed that he would defend the residents of new york from the newly aggressive immigration authorities, “ regardless of where they come from, regardless of their immigration status. ” a year later, the federal government has ratcheted up its attacks against so - called sanctuary cities like new york — including chicago, philadelphia and san francisco — threatening to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding for law enforcement programs and detaining growing numbers of undocumented residents. cities faced a friday deadline to prove their cooperation with the immigration authorities, as the united states immigration and customs enforcement agency, known as ice, continued making arrests. nationwide, the number of arrests in 2017 increased 41 percent from the year before. in new york, where some 500, 000 residents are undocumented, if ice wants to arrest somebody, it can. “ putting a bubble over a city where ice can ’ t penetrate is not possible, ” said camille mackler, the legal policy director of the new york immigration coalition, an activist group. “ people think ‘ sanctuary city ’ — that you ’ re able to walk freely without fear. that ’ s not the case. ” ice agents have been appearing in new york ’ s courthouses and at people ’ s front doors, and, according to immigrant advocates, even entered a manhattan church with a spanish - speaking immigrant congregation. while the new york police department does not generally hand over detainees to ice, it does, through a bureaucratic backdoor, essentially provide a road map : arrest information is sent to the state, which shares it with the federal bureau of investigation. ice can now see that information. “ it ’ s hardly a sanctuary, ” said muzaffar chishti, the director of the migration policy institute ’ s office at new york university school of law. “ the mayor of the city of new york does not hide people under his desk. we ’ re fully cooperating with ice. people get deported from new york all the time. ” immigration arrests of residents without criminal records more than tripled in new york after president trump took office. of the 2, 976 arrests in 2017, 899 were of people without criminal convictions, up from 250 out of 1, 762 in 2016, according to ice statistics. under the obama administration, undocumented immigrants without criminal records were not priorities for deportation. mr. de blasio often says that the term “ sanctuary city ” is misinterpreted : it is",0.999982237815856,0.499982249086315,1,398,3.27,3.52,6.28,1.51,0.25,4.52,9.05,2.51,0.25,1.26,1.51,0.5,3.77,0.0,0.5,0.25,0.25,0.0,11.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.0,1.51,4.27,0.5,0.5,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,10.3,1.01,8.79,0.75,0.0,0.0,6.53,2.51,4.02,0.25,5.778894472361809,7.788944723618091,0.5025125628140703

NYTimes,"There is a lot of debate these days about whether the United States owes its African-American citizens reparations for slavery. It does. But there is a far bigger bill that the United States and Europe have run up: what they owe to other countries for their colonial adventures, for the wars they imposed on them, for the inequality they have built into the world order, for the excess carbon they have dumped into the atmosphere. The creditor countries aren’t seriously suggesting that the West send sacks of gold bullion every year to India or Nigeria. Their people are asking for fairness: for the borders of the rich countries to be opened to goods and people, to Indian textiles as well as Nigerian doctors. In seeking to move, they are asking for immigration as reparations. Today, a quarter of a billion people are migrants. They are moving because the rich countries have stolen the future of the poor countries. Whether it is Iraqis and Syrians fleeing the effects of illegal American wars, or Africans seeking to work for their former European colonial masters, or Guatemalans and Hondurans trying to get into the country that peddles them guns and buys their drugs: They are coming here because we were there. Before you ask them to respect our borders, ask yourself: Has the West ever respected anyone’s borders? A vast majority of migrants move from a poor to a less poor country, not a rich one. Immigration quotas should be based on how much the host country has ruined other countries. Britain should have quotas for Indians and Nigerians; France for Malians and Tunisians; Belgium for very large numbers of Congolese. And when they come, they should be allowed to bring their families and stay — unlike the “guest workers” who were enticed to build up the postwar labor force of the colonizers and then asked to leave when their masters were done exploiting them. The Dominican Republic, where the United States propped up the dictator Rafael Trujillo for three decades, should be high on the American preference list. So should Iraq, upon which we imposed a war that resulted in 600,000 deaths. Justice now demands that we let in 600,000 Iraqis: for each death we caused there, someone should get a chance at a new life here. Some 12 million Africans were enslaved and carried across the Atlantic by European powers. Should not 12 million people from Africa be allowed to live in the countries enriched by the toil of their ancestors? Both will be better off: the African still suffering from what slavery has done to his country, and the host country that will again benefit from African labor, but this time without enormous pain and for a fair wage. Just as there is a carbon tax on polluting industries, there should be a “migration tax” on the nations who got rich while emitting greenhouse gases. The United States is responsible for one-third of the excess carbon in the atmosphere; Europe, another one-quarter. A hundred million refugees fleeing hurricanes and droughts will have to be resettled by the end of the century. The United States should take a third, and Europe another quarter. A huge bill would come to the West, but it is one it should look forward to paying. Without immigration, America’s economic growth would have been 15 percent lower from 1990 to 2014; Britain’s would have been a full 20 percent lower. Immigrants are 14 percent of the American population, but they started a quarter of all new businesses and since 2000 earned over a third of the American Nobel Prizes in chemistry, physics and medicine. Migrants are 3 percent of the world’s population but contribute 9 percent of its gross domestic product. Their taxes prop up the pension systems of the wealthy nations, which are not making enough babies of their own. If you want to help the poorest people in the world, the fastest way to do so is to ease barriers to migration. Migrants sent back $689 billion in remittances last year, which amounts to three times more than the direct gains from abolishing all trade barriers, four times more than all the foreign aid given by those governments and 100 times the amount of all debt relief. Are the rich countries obligated to take in any and all comers from the countries they have despoiled? There are serious arguments against open borders: that the United States is a lifeboat in an ocean of poor nations, and letting too many people in will sink the boat; that even if we owe reparations to people we have dispossessed, those reparations can come in the form of cash payments or resettlement in another territory. There are no serious arguments that demonstrate long-term economic damage to countries that accept immigrants, even in large numbers. During the age of mass migration, a quarter of Europe moved to the United States, which went on to replace Europe at the pinnacle of wealth and power. A world with more open borders would have a brief spasm of mass movement, and then migration might actually decrease, because money and happiness would be more equitably spread around, and more people would stay home. To avoid paying the “migration tax,” the rich countries would have to stop propping up dictators, stop starting savage and unnecessary wars, restrain their multinational corporations from ripping off mineral wealth of poor countries and make sure that global trade is more equitable. Or else the migration bill from the devastated country would be prohibitive. What is good immigration policy for the United States is separate from what is just and moral for the peoples whose destiny America, past and present, has affected. It might make economic sense for the United States to let in more skilled Indians and fewer unskilled Latinos, but America owes them more, and it should open its doors more to its southern neighbors. History is what has happened and can never un-happen; history is happening right now. Attention needs to be paid. So does the bill.","there is a lot of debate these days about whether the united states owes its african - american citizens reparations for slavery. it does. but there is a far bigger bill that the united states and europe have run up : what they owe to other countries for their colonial adventures, for the wars they imposed on them, for the inequality they have built into the world order, for the excess carbon they have dumped into the atmosphere. the creditor countries aren ’ t seriously suggesting that the west send sacks of gold bullion every year to india or nigeria. their people are asking for fairness : for the borders of the rich countries to be opened to goods and people, to indian textiles as well as nigerian doctors. in seeking to move, they are asking for immigration as reparations. today, a quarter of a billion people are migrants. they are moving because the rich countries have stolen the future of the poor countries. whether it is iraqis and syrians fleeing the effects of illegal american wars, or africans seeking to work for their former european colonial masters, or guatemalans and hondurans trying to get into the country that peddles them guns and buys their drugs : they are coming here because we were there. before you ask them to respect our borders, ask yourself : has the west ever respected anyone ’ s borders? a vast majority of migrants move from a poor to a less poor country, not a rich one. immigration quotas should be based on how much the host country has ruined other countries. britain should have quotas for indians and nigerians ; france for malians and tunisians ; belgium for very large numbers of congolese. and when they come, they should be allowed to bring their families and stay — unlike the “ guest workers ” who were enticed to build up the postwar labor force of the colonizers and then asked to leave when their masters were done exploiting them. the dominican republic, where the united states propped up the dictator rafael trujillo for three decades, should be high on the american preference list. so should iraq, upon which we imposed a war that resulted in 600, 000 deaths. justice now demands that we let in 600, 000 iraqis : for each death we caused there, someone should get a chance at a new life here. some 12 million africans were enslaved and carried across the atlantic by european powers. should not 12 million people from africa be allowed to live in the countries enriched by the toil of their ancestors? both will be better off : the african still",0.999971508979797,0.499971535644363,1,432,2.55,5.79,9.26,1.39,1.16,6.71,8.56,0.69,2.31,2.08,1.39,0.23,3.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.89,0.46,0.23,0.0,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.93,1.62,0.0,1.16,0.46,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.46,0.23,0.23,10.65,2.31,8.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.01,2.78,3.24,0.46,5.555555555555555,7.175925925925926,1.8518518518518516
FoxNews,"The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it will directly ask the Supreme Court to overrule a federal court judge who last week barred officials from asking about citizenship on the 2020 census, saying in a court opinion that such a question would dramatically reduce the response rate -- and congressional representation -- of noncitizens.
The White House's highly unusual move, if approved by the Supreme Court, would allow the administration's lawyers to bypass intermediate appellate courts. Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in court papers filed Tuesday that the rare and fast turnaround is necessary if census questionnaires are to be printed in time.
The once-a-decade census determines not only how many seats are apportioned per district in the House of Representatives, but also how hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenue are distributed.
It's been 30 years since the court took on an issue without waiting for a federal appeals court to weigh in. Francisco says the justices should hear arguments in April or a special session in May.
The many court challenges against the Trump administration's bid to add a citizenship question, legal experts tell OutletName, face an uphill battle not only because conservatives now command a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court, but also because traditionally it's been the White House's prerogative to decide whether to inquire about citizenship on the census.
WATCH: ILLEGAL IMMIGRATIONS FEARFUL OF NEW CITIZENSHIP QUESTION
Former President Barack Obama's administration didn't ask the question in the 2010 census amid fears it would unconstitutionally intimidate illegal immigrants into avoiding answering their census questions -- and thus not count toward population totals used to determine the number of seats each state receives in the House of Representatives.
The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.
""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law,"" Chapman University law professor and constitutional law expert John Eastman told OutletName. ""The recent move is simply to restore what had long been the case.""
Eastman also told OutletName it would be legally permissible for the government to only count citizens for purposes of determining representation in the House of Representatives. However, other legal experts have contested that view, saying the Constitution demands that all ""persons"" be tallied -- not simply all citizens.
ANALYSIS: TRUMP IS RIGHT, ENDING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS CONSTITUTIONAL
Democrats would lose out because the citizenship question would affect predominantly liberal districts, but that's not a legally sufficient objection, legal analysts say.
The citizenship question represents the third time since October that Francisco is seeking the court's intervention without an appellate ruling. The other two involved Obama-era programs to shield young immigrants from deportation and allow transgender people to serve in the military.
""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law."" — Chapman University law professor John Eastman
The Supreme Court hasn't acted on the immigration case, and an appellate court has since ruled on the issue. The justices on Tuesday denied early review of the transgender service policy, but allowed Pentagon restrictions that had been blocked by lower courts to take effect while the appeals process unfolds.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced in March 2018 that the 2020 census would be the first since 1950 to include a citizenship question. He contended that the question would help the government enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act and ensure access to the ballot.
But 18 states, the District of Columbia, 15 big cities or counties, and immigrants' rights groups sued the Commerce Department, which designs the census, and claimed it failed to properly analyze the effect that the question would have on households with immigrants. The challengers said the Trump administration added the question to discourage immigrants from participating, potentially leading to a population undercount — and possibly fewer seats in Congress — in places that tend to vote Democratic.
U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman used Census Bureau estimates to conclude the citizenship question would depress responses in households with noncitizens by at least 5.8 percent.
TUCKER: BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS A TOTAL SCAM
Furman ruled that Ross acted in an ""arbitrary and capricious"" manner and violated the law.
The justices already had agreed to an administration request to hear arguments over whether Furman could base his decision on depositions of high-ranking officials and other material that was not part of the administrative record the Commerce Department compiled in deciding to ask about citizenship. In the end, Furman largely stuck to that record and the court has now called off arguments that were scheduled for Feb. 19.
The court could decide in the  few weeks whether to set new arguments on the timetable the Justice Department wants.
During his confirmation hearings in October, Trump's pick to lead the Census Bureau, Steven Dillingham, largely avoided questions on the matter. He later won Senate confirmation.

Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., tried to get Dillingham to weigh in, saying that citizens in “Montana should have more of a say in Washington, D.C., than illegal immigrants harboring in sanctuary cities across the country.""

OutletName' Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.","the trump administration announced tuesday that it will directly ask the supreme court to overrule a federal court judge who last week barred officials from asking about citizenship on the 2020 census, saying in a court opinion that such a question would dramatically reduce the response rate - - and congressional representation - - of noncitizens. the white house's highly unusual move, if approved by the supreme court, would allow the administration's lawyers to bypass intermediate appellate courts. solicitor general noel francisco said in court papers filed tuesday that the rare and fast turnaround is necessary if census questionnaires are to be printed in time. the once - a - decade census determines not only how many seats are apportioned per district in the house of representatives, but also how hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenue are distributed. it's been 30 years since the court took on an issue without waiting for a federal appeals court to weigh in. francisco says the justices should hear arguments in april or a special session in may. the many court challenges against the trump administration's bid to add a citizenship question, legal experts tell outletname, face an uphill battle not only because conservatives now command a 5 - 4 majority on the supreme court, but also because traditionally it's been the white house's prerogative to decide whether to inquire about citizenship on the census. watch : illegal immigrations fearful of new citizenship question former president barack obama's administration didn't ask the question in the 2010 census amid fears it would unconstitutionally intimidate illegal immigrants into avoiding answering their census questions - - and thus not count toward population totals used to determine the number of seats each state receives in the house of representatives. the citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long - form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. in 2010, there was no long - form questionnaire.

NYTimes,"The question of whether the administration’s security measures unfairly single out Muslims is at the heart of the coming Supreme Court arguments over President Trump’s latest travel ban. That ban limits most forms of immigration from some of the same countries, but it does not apply to refugees, who have been dealt with separately.
President Trump set a ceiling of 45,000 refugee admissions for the fiscal year, compared with the 85,000 set by President Barack Obama the year before amid an unabated refugee crisis worldwide, including civil war in Syria and conflict in other countries. Last year, hundreds of thousands of Muslims fled Myanmar to Bangladesh, where they are parked in camps.
The government is on pace to let in much fewer than 45,000 refugees. About 6,000 have been admitted since the fiscal year began on Oct. 1, and only 791 were Muslims, according to the International Rescue Committee. In the previous fiscal year, 14,496 Muslims were admitted.
But Muslims are not the only ones affected by the slowdown. Mark Hetfield, president of the HIAS resettlement agency, said the administration’s approach has also excluded some Christians from the Middle East. And some refugees who were admitted in previous years have been unable to reunite with family members still stuck in refugee camps abroad.
The number of admissions could rise now that the government has reopened the door for people from the 11 countries, although officials noted that 45,000 refugees was a ceiling, not a target, and that there would be a “lag time” as agencies put the new security measures in place.
Officials said the new measures would involve more “in-depth” interviews and “deep-dive” background checks, but they declined to be more specific. “We won’t give our playbook to our enemies,” one administration official said on a conference call with reporters.
With existing security checks, it can take two years for a refugee to be approved for admission to the United States. The vetting includes several interviews of family members, often together and apart; background checks; fingerprinting; and iris scans.
Critics of the administration’s new rules noted that no refugees have carried out a terrorist attack on American soil.
“By instituting a risk-based analysis to determine refugee admissions, the administration is essentially implementing a Muslim refugee ban without saying it, despite the number of security screenings already in place,” said Kevin Appleby, senior director for international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies.
But Ira Mehlman, the media director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that favors restricting immigration, said the administration was right to scrutinize refugees more closely.
“The obligation of the government is to ensure that people let in have been thoroughly vetted,” he said, adding that most people are not endangered by waiting longer for processing.
“Given that these countries have little infrastructure and accurate record-keeping, the vetting process is going to be somewhat more difficult.”","the question of whether the administration ’ s security measures unfairly single out muslims is at the heart of the coming supreme court arguments over president trump ’ s latest travel ban. that ban limits most forms of immigration from some of the same countries, but it does not apply to refugees, who have been dealt with separately. president trump set a ceiling of 45, 000 refugee admissions for the fiscal year, compared with the 85, 000 set by president barack obama the year before amid an unabated refugee crisis worldwide, including civil war in syria and conflict in other countries. last year, hundreds of thousands of muslims fled myanmar to bangladesh, where they are parked in camps. the government is on pace to let in much fewer than 45, 000 refugees. about 6, 000 have been admitted since the fiscal year began on oct. 1, and only 791 were muslims, according to the international rescue committee. in the previous fiscal year, 14, 496 muslims were admitted. but muslims are not the only ones affected by the slowdown. mark hetfield, president of the hias resettlement agency, said the administration ’ s approach has also excluded some christians from the middle east. and some refugees who were admitted in previous years have been unable to reunite with family members still stuck in refugee camps abroad. the number of admissions could rise now that the government has reopened the door for people from the 11 countries, although officials noted that 45, 000 refugees was a ceiling, not a target, and that there would be a “ lag time ” as agencies put the new security measures in place. officials said the new measures would involve more “ in - depth ” interviews and “ deep - dive ” background checks, but they declined to be more specific. “ we won ’ t give our playbook to our enemies, ” one administration official said on a conference call with reporters. with existing security checks, it can take two years for a refugee to be approved for admission to the united states. the vetting includes several interviews of family members, often together and apart ; background checks ; fingerprinting ; and iris scans. critics of the administration ’ s new rules noted that no refugees have carried out a terrorist attack on american soil. “ by instituting a risk - based analysis to determine refugee admissions, the administration is essentially implementing a muslim refugee ban without saying it, despite the number of security screenings already in place, ” said kevin appleby, senior director for international migration policy at the center for migration studies. but ira mehlman, the media director",0.999982714653015,0.499982698080203,1,424,4.72,5.9,8.02,2.12,0.47,5.19,7.55,1.42,0.71,0.94,0.47,0.0,4.25,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.24,0.0,12.03,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.25,0.71,1.65,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,1.65,9.43,1.89,7.55,0.24,0.0,0.0,4.95,5.19,2.83,0.0,3.7735849056603774,8.254716981132075,2.1226415094339623
HuffPost,"A few years ago a teenager in San Francisco made a mistake that landed him in immigration detention. One day after school, the 13-year-old punched his classmate and stole 46 cents.
The student, an undocumented immigrant from Australia, apologized, but the school called the police, who turned the teen over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE detained him for a few days and threatened to deport him and his family.
“He was traumatized and he was scared,” said Angela Chan, the policy director for Asian Americans Advancing Justice — Asian Law Caucus and the immigration attorney who represented the boy and his family. “It is a human rights violation to separate a young child from their family for an adolescent mistake,” Chan told OutletName.
It was no accident the teenager ended up detained by ICE back in 2010. More than 100 immigrant youth in San Francisco were detained or deported because of a 2008 city policy implemented by former mayor and now-Gov. Gavin Newsom and supported by Kamala Harris, then the city’s district attorney, who is now a Democratic senator running for president.
Though San Francisco is a sanctuary city, the policy required police to notify ICE about undocumented youth arrested for felonies, in some cases for minor crimes. The juveniles were handed over even before guilt or innocence was proved.
This was one of the worst human rights crises we saw in San Francisco in the last 30 years. Francisco Ugarte, immigration attorney with San Francisco’s Public Defender’s Office
Immigration advocates told OutletName that Harris needs to publicly revoke her support for the legislation and acknowledge the trauma it caused San Francisco’s undocumented youth and their families. Otherwise, they say, she cannot be a credible voice on immigrant rights, an issue that will be at the forefront of the 2020 election.
“This was one of the worst human rights crises we saw in San Francisco in the last 30 years,” said Francisco Ugarte, the managing immigration attorney with San Francisco’s Public Defender’s Office.
So far, Harris has defended her support for the policy, which was changed in 2011 when Newsom left office.
Her campaign spokesperson, Ian Sams, said in a recent statement to OutletName that the policy was intended to protect the sanctuary status of San Francisco and to ensure police maintained strong relationships with immigrant communities. “Looking back, this policy could have been applied more fairly,” Sams said.
In a recent interview with Political Party Live, a podcast about Iowa politics, Harris said the fact that juveniles were turned over to ICE before they were even convicted of a felony was an “unintended consequence” that she did not support.
But immigration advocates say the stated purpose of the policy was to report undocumented youth to immigration authorities without giving them due process and told OutletName that Harris’ statement is confusing and contradictory.
“Until she recognizes that what she did was a mistake, I don’t think she will have the credibility of a champion,” said David Campos, chairman of the San Francisco Democratic Party and former member of the city’s Board of Supervisors.
Harris’ statement references the fact that last year, Newsom told The Sacramento Bee that his policy was designed to protect San Francisco’s sanctuary status, which limits the city’s cooperation with ICE, at a time when it was under attack by the federal government because of a high-profile triple murder committed by an undocumented immigrant. Newsom said he thought his 2008 legislation was a compromise that would appease critics enough to leave the city’s sanctuary ordinance intact.
Chan, the lawyer for the teenager detained by ICE, said Newsom’s policy created panic in the community and undercut any trust immigrants had in police. The threat of deportation made immigrant victims and witnesses afraid to report crimes, she said, and immigrant parents were fearful of sending their kids to school in case the police got involved in a classroom incident.
There’s no reason for any official to be defending or rationalizing draconian deportation policies that are part of California’s past. Salvador Sarmiento, National Day Laborer Organizing Network
Harris’ supporters have pointed out that she has a record of fighting for immigrant rights.
In a statement to OutletName, her campaign spokesperson highlighted Harris’ crackdown on trafficking, her push for temporary visa protections for crime victims, her support of DACA, and the legal services she provided to unaccompanied minors as California’s attorney general as a few examples.
“Senator Harris has been a champion for immigrants throughout her career,” said the spokesperson. “She will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and to protect Dreamers, their families, and TPS recipients as president.”
Still, some said they couldn’t consider Harris a credible voice on immigration until she properly addresses and takes responsibility for her support of Newsom’s 2008 policy.
“There’s no reason for any official to be defending or rationalizing draconian deportation policies that are part of California’s past,” said Salvador Sarmiento, the national campaign coordinator for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network. “We expect all officials to recognize their mistakes and rectify them so that we can be sure they will mitigate the harm these policies have caused on our communities.”
Carrie Rosenbaum, a San Francisco-based immigration attorney, told OutletName that she is disappointed the senator didn’t revoke her support for Newsom’s 2008 policy and explain why her stance has changed. “Standing by the policy undermines her position as a supporter of immigrant rights,” Rosenbaum said, adding that if Harris really stands by the legislation, “she should be more forthcoming with voters about the ways in which her role as a prosecutor influences her views on immigration enforcement.”
While Ugarte, the public defender, says Harris has been moving in a more progressive direction on immigration by vocally opposing the Trump administration’s family separation policy and travel ban, he’s concerned that her recent comments about the need for “smart border security” evoke Obama-era rhetoric that resulted in the mass deportation of immigrants.
Ugarte said that if Harris doesn’t talk about defunding ICE and ending “collaboration between local law enforcement and immigration,” advocates “have legitimate reason to be concerned about what she would do if she were president of the U.S.”
But, he added, Harris first needs to vocally renounce her support for the 2008 immigration policy.
“If she wants to be someone who can stand up against Donald Trump and against the demonization of immigrants,” Ugarte said, “then taking a look at what happened in San Francisco in 2008 is a very important thing.”
The 13-year-old who was detained by ICE in 2010 for instigating a fight with his classmate was ultimately not deported back to Australia. But he and his family were allowed to stay in the U.S. only because their lawyer, Chan, launched an aggressive media campaign. She says many other families weren’t as lucky.","a few years ago a teenager in san francisco made a mistake that landed him in immigration detention. one day after school, the 13 - year - old punched his classmate and stole 46 cents. the student, an undocumented immigrant from australia, apologized, but the school called the police, who turned the teen over to immigration and customs enforcement. ice detained him for a few days and threatened to deport him and his family. “ he was traumatized and he was scared, ” said angela chan, the policy director for asian americans advancing justice — asian law caucus and the immigration attorney who represented the boy and his family. “ it is a human rights violation to separate a young child from their family for an adolescent mistake, ” chan told outletname. it was no accident the teenager ended up detained by ice back in 2010. more than 100 immigrant youth in san francisco were detained or deported because of a 2008 city policy implemented by former mayor and now - gov. gavin newsom and supported by kamala harris, then the city ’ s district attorney, who is now a democratic senator running for president. though san francisco is a sanctuary city, the policy required police to notify ice about undocumented youth arrested for felonies, in some cases for minor crimes. the juveniles were handed over even before guilt or innocence was proved. this was one of the worst human rights crises we saw in san francisco in the last 30 years. francisco ugarte, immigration attorney with san francisco ’ s public defender ’ s office immigration advocates told outletname that harris needs to publicly revoke her support for the legislation and acknowledge the trauma it caused san francisco ’ s undocumented youth and their families. otherwise, they say, she cannot be a credible voice on immigrant rights, an issue that will be at the forefront of the 2020 election. “ this was one of the worst human rights crises we saw in san francisco in the last 30 years, ” said francisco ugarte, the managing immigration attorney with san francisco ’ s public defender ’ s office. so far, harris has defended her support for the policy, which was changed in 2011 when newsom left office. her campaign spokesperson, ian sams, said in a recent statement to outletname that the policy was intended to protect the sanctuary status of san francisco and to ensure police maintained strong relationships with immigrant communities. “ looking back, this policy could have been applied more fairly, ” sams said. in a recent interview with political party live, a podcast about iowa politics, harris said the",0.99997866153717,0.499978696425387,1,424,2.83,3.77,8.02,2.12,0.0,5.9,5.19,0.24,1.18,1.18,0.71,0.24,2.36,0.0,0.94,0.24,0.0,0.0,15.57,0.94,0.24,0.94,2.12,0.47,0.0,2.12,0.24,0.0,0.94,0.71,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.94,8.25,0.47,6.84,0.71,0.0,0.0,5.9,7.78,1.89,0.24,7.0754716981132075,11.79245283018868,0.2358490566037736
HuffPost,"President Donald Trump’s partial government shutdown over his border wall closed in on the two-week mark and a brand-new Congress on Wednesday with no end in sight.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi made their first visit to the White House since their Dec. 11 meeting with Trump, when he said he would be “proud” to take responsibility for a government shutdown in his effort to force Congress to spend billions of dollars on a wall along the southern border. On Wednesday, the Democratic leaders emerged from the White House after 90 minutes, unified on not giving in to Trump.
“They are now feeling the heat,” Schumer said.
Pelosi, who is expected to return to the House speakership Thursday afternoon after eight years as minority leader, intends as her first action to pass spending bills that won Republican support last year to reopen the closed agencies.
“We’re asking the president to open the government,” she told reporters on the White House driveway. “We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do that?”
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, though, said he will not take up legislation that Trump has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue.
About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight Dec. 21 after Trump reneged on his commitment to a sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the Senate on a unanimous vote. Trump changed his mind after OutletName and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money.
Trump is now insisting that Congress appropriate $5.7 billion for that project, while Democrats want a short-term spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security and full-year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately.
In the meantime, about 800,000 federal employees ― about half furloughed, half deemed “essential” and required to work anyway ― face real problems with their household finances. Many will miss their first paycheck on Jan. 11 unless Trump signs a spending bill before then. Employees would have to dip into their savings or borrow money to pay their bills, as there is no government program to help them.
Trump, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top Democratic and Republican congressional leaders.
When asked how long the shutdown would last, the president replied, “As long as it takes,” calling his wall, a signature campaign promise, a matter of “national security.”
Trump’s comments came at what was billed as the first Cabinet meeting of 2019. Instead, Trump spent the first hour and a half of it complaining about a variety of issues, such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis’ performance and the late Sen. John McCain’s vote against Trump’s repeal of Obamacare, as well as offering his musings on such things as the utility of wheels and his desire for Russia to invade Afghanistan again.
Trump’s remarks were riddled with falsehoods on everything from trade to the number of illegal immigrants in the country to the way NATO works.
The White House did not respond to OutletName queries about whether Trump understood that what he was saying was false and, if he did, why he was doing so anyway.
Trump promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would get Mexico to pay for it. But since taking office, Trump has never asked Mexico for payment. Instead, he began threatening to shut down the government earlier this year unless Congress gave him billions of dollars to build it ― even though the type of structure he wants remains unclear.
During the campaign, he promised a “great, great” wall made of reinforced concrete that would rise 30 feet or more and extend so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath. In recent months, he has at times said the wall could just be steel slats, which would be like the “bollard fencing” developed during President Barack Obama’s administration.
In a tweet Wednesday morning, Trump claimed, falsely, that Mexico was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway.
Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback! — Donald J. Trump () January 2, 2019
Despite numerous requests over several weeks, the White House has not provided any economic analysis to back up Trump’s claims. Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revisions in the revised North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump has rebranded the United States Mexico Canada Agreement, will not bring in to the U.S. Treasury anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall. More important, what extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by people in the U.S., not Mexico.","president donald trump ’ s partial government shutdown over his border wall closed in on the two - week mark and a brand - new congress on wednesday with no end in sight. senate minority leader chuck schumer and house speaker - to - be nancy pelosi made their first visit to the white house since their dec. 11 meeting with trump, when he said he would be “ proud ” to take responsibility for a government shutdown in his effort to force congress to spend billions of dollars on a wall along the southern border. on wednesday, the democratic leaders emerged from the white house after 90 minutes, unified on not giving in to trump. “ they are now feeling the heat, ” schumer said. pelosi, who is expected to return to the house speakership thursday afternoon after eight years as minority leader, intends as her first action to pass spending bills that won republican support last year to reopen the closed agencies. “ we ’ re asking the president to open the government, ” she told reporters on the white house driveway. “ we are giving him a republican path to do that. why would he not do that? ” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, though, said he will not take up legislation that trump has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue. about a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight dec. 21 after trump reneged on his commitment to a sign a short - term spending bill that had already passed the senate on a unanimous vote. trump changed his mind after outletname and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money. trump is now insisting that congress appropriate $ 5. 7 billion for that project, while democrats want a short - term spending bill for the department of homeland security and full - year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately. in the meantime, about 800, 000 federal employees ― about half furloughed, half deemed “ essential ” and required to work anyway ― face real problems with their household finances. many will miss their first paycheck on jan. 11 unless trump signs a spending bill before then. employees would have to dip into their savings or borrow money to pay their bills, as there is no government program to help them. trump, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top democratic and republican congressional leaders. when asked how long the shutdown would last, the president replied, “ as long as it takes",0.999982595443725,0.499982649766025,1,425,3.76,5.88,6.82,1.18,1.18,4.71,7.76,0.71,2.12,1.18,0.24,0.47,2.82,0.24,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.59,0.24,0.0,0.47,3.29,0.0,1.65,5.65,4.24,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.24,9.41,1.41,6.82,0.94,0.0,0.47,8.71,4.24,2.59,1.41,2.1176470588235294,7.529411764705881,0.4705882352941176
Daily Caller,"The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will review lower court rulings blocking enforcement of President Donald Trump’s executive order on refugee and migrant entry, and stayed injunctions barring the order’s enforcement.
The announcement is a major victory for the president, whose signature immigration policy has been stymied repeatedly by the federal courts.
The justices consolidated two travel ban cases from the 4th and 9th Circuits, and scheduled oral arguments for the first session of the Court’s next term, which begins in October. They also partially vacated several lower court injunctions barring enforcement of the order’s travel ban provision, which prohibits the entry of foreign nationals from six countries with high instances of terrorism for a 90-day period.
“We grant the government’s applications to stay the injunctions, to the extent the injunctions prevent enforcement of 2(c) with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.”
Two classes of foreign national from the six countries named in the order may still enter the United States; aliens with relatives in America, or individuals with a meaningful connection to corporate entities and educational institutions in the United States will not be affected by the order.
“To prevent the government from pursuing that objective by enforcing 2(c) against foreign nationals unconnected to the United States would appreciably injure its interests, without alleviating obvious hardship to anyone else,” the Court wrote.
The Court also will allow the order’s provisions concerning refugee resettlement to take effect, with the same exceptions it provided for the travel ban. The directive reduces the number of refugees the United States will accept from 110,000 to 50,000, and denies refugee entry for 120 days.
As such, most of the president’s order will take effect within the next few days.
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote an opinion concurring and dissenting in part with the Court’s decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. Thomas argued the stays should be issued in full, without exception. He writes:
I fear that the Court’s remedy will prove unworkable. Today’s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding—on peril of contempt— whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country. See ante, at 11– 12. The compromise also will invite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits, as parties and courts struggle to determine what exactly constitutes a “bona fide relationship,” who precisely has a “credible claim” to that relationship, and whether the claimed relationship was formed ‘simply to avoid §2(c)’ of [the] Executive Order.
The National Immigration Law Center, an immigrant advocacy group litigating against the order, vowed to continue their fight against the travel restrictions.
“Today’s unanimous Supreme Court decision is a clear victory for our national security,” the president said. “It allows the travel suspension for the six terror-prone countries and the refugee suspension to become largely effective.”
“My number one responsibility as Commander in Chief is to keep the American people safe,” he added. “Today’s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation’s homeland. I am also particularly gratified that the Supreme Court’s decision was 9-0.”
It is not immediately clear that the ruling was unanimous. The Court issued its decision unsigned, and did not include a tally of the justice’s votes, as is typical of per curiam opinions. Five votes were needed to issue the stays, and four to review the lower court rulings. Given Thomas’ opinion dissenting as to the scope of the stay, it is safe to say there was a high degree of consensus — if Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch supported a broader stay, then at least five of the other six justices supported the stay the Court tailored. However, one cannot definitively say it was unanimous.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions expressed confidence that the high court would ultimately uphold the legality of the president’s order.
“Through Article II of the Constitution, the founders of our country vested the Executive Branch with a great responsibility: to ensure the national security of our country,” he said. “I am committed to defending the President’s ability to exercise that responsibility and the Department of Justice is confident that the United States Supreme Court will uphold this constitutional and necessary executive order.”","the supreme court announced monday that it will review lower court rulings blocking enforcement of president donald trump ’ s executive order on refugee and migrant entry, and stayed injunctions barring the order ’ s enforcement. the announcement is a major victory for the president, whose signature immigration policy has been stymied repeatedly by the federal courts. the justices consolidated two travel ban cases from the 4th and 9th circuits, and scheduled oral arguments for the first session of the court ’ s next term, which begins in october. they also partially vacated several lower court injunctions barring enforcement of the order ’ s travel ban provision, which prohibits the entry of foreign nationals from six countries with high instances of terrorism for a 90 - day period. “ we grant the government ’ s applications to stay the injunctions, to the extent the injunctions prevent enforcement of 2 ( c ) with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the united states. ” two classes of foreign national from the six countries named in the order may still enter the united states ; aliens with relatives in america, or individuals with a meaningful connection to corporate entities and educational institutions in the united states will not be affected by the order. “ to prevent the government from pursuing that objective by enforcing 2 ( c ) against foreign nationals unconnected to the united states would appreciably injure its interests, without alleviating obvious hardship to anyone else, ” the court wrote. the court also will allow the order ’ s provisions concerning refugee resettlement to take effect, with the same exceptions it provided for the travel ban. the directive reduces the number of refugees the united states will accept from 110, 000 to 50, 000, and denies refugee entry for 120 days. as such, most of the president ’ s order will take effect within the next few days. justice clarence thomas wrote an opinion concurring and dissenting in part with the court ’ s decision, joined by justices samuel alito and neil gorsuch. thomas argued the stays should be issued in full, without exception. he writes : i fear that the court ’ s remedy will prove unworkable. today ’ s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding — on peril of contempt — whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the united states have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country. see ante, at 11 – 12. the compromise also will invite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits, as parties",0.593808054924011,0.093808084726334,0,425,4.71,4.0,8.71,1.18,0.47,7.29,8.24,2.12,1.18,0.94,1.41,0.47,3.53,0.0,0.94,0.24,0.71,0.0,9.88,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.24,0.0,2.59,0.0,0.0,0.47,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.71,6.35,1.18,4.71,0.24,0.0,0.0,3.76,2.59,1.88,2.35,8.235294117647058,6.352941176470588,0.2352941176470588
NYTimes,"The procedural vote does not immediately end the shutdown. The Senate must still grant final approval of the bill, and it must then be approved by the House.
But final passage is a formality, and after a weekend of partisan finger-pointing — in which Democrats branded the shutdown the “Trump Shutdown,” after President Trump, and Republicans branded it the “Schumer shutdown” — the vote offered both parties a way out of an ugly impasse that threatened to cause political harm to both parties.
Mr. Schumer, speaking on the Senate floor, announced that he and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, had “come to an arrangement” to adopt the three-week spending measure while continuing to negotiate a “global agreement” that would include the fate of the dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.
Monday’s vote came after a frantic weekend of work by a bipartisan group of more than 20 senators, who on Sunday night were discussing a plan in which the government would stay open through early February, coupled with a promise from Mr. McConnell to allow a vote on a measure to protect the Dreamers from deportation.
Mr. McConnell pledged Monday morning that he would permit a “free and open debate” on immigration next month if the issue had not been resolved by then. But his promise was not enough for many Democrats, and on Monday morning, moderate Senate Democrats were still pressing for more in exchange for their votes to end the shutdown.
By the time of the vote just after noon on Monday, the moderate Democrats were predicting the vote would pass.
“We’re going to reopen the government,” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat whose state is home to thousands of federal workers, told reporters. Mr. Warner said there was now a “path clear on how we’re going to get a full-year budget and we got a path clear on how we’re going to start an immigration debate.” Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he was a “strong” yes.
“I said before trust but verify,” he said of Mr. McConnell. “He made this commitment publicly in the Senate floor. He was much more specific than he was last night. And frankly I think this is an important opportunity for him to demonstrate that he will carry through.”

“Put this mess behind us.”
Mr. McConnell said on Monday morning that the Senate would move ahead with a scheduled procedural vote at noon on a proposal to fund the government through Feb. 8, and he urged his colleagues to put an end to the shutdown.
“Every day we spend arguing about keeping the lights on is another day we cannot spend negotiating DACA or defense spending or any of our other shared priorities,” Mr. McConnell said, referring to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the program put in place by the Obama administration that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation.
Mr. McConnell reiterated a pledge he offered on Sunday night that he intended for the Senate to take up immigration legislation in February if the issue has not been resolved by then. A major question as senators seek to end the shutdown is what kind of commitment Mr. McConnell is willing to make regarding the consideration of legislation for the young immigrants, a central issue in the current impasse.
On Monday, Mr. McConnell pledged that the Senate’s immigration debate would have “a level playing field at the outset and an amendment process that is fair to all sides.”
“The very first step is ending the government shutdown,” he said.

Democrats wanted more than McConnell’s word.
Moderate Senate Democrats Monday morning had sought a firmer commitment from Mr. McConnell that the Senate would move to address the fate of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, in the coming weeks.
The Democrats were part of a bipartisan group of more than 20 senators working throughout the weekend to forge a compromise to reopen the government. Mr. McConnell signaled Sunday night that he was listening to their demands, saying from the Senate floor that he intended to move ahead with immigration legislation in February if the issue had not been resolved by then. But on Monday, Democrats wanted more in exchange for the votes to end the shutdown.
“Well I think the first thing he needs to do is strengthen his statement from last night,” said Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who votes with the Democrats. “ ‘I intend.’ I would much rather he say, ‘I commit’ or ‘I will move.’”
As senators from the group shuffled in and out of leadership offices, Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona and another member of the group, expressed optimism that such a public statement by Mr. McConnell would be enough to win over enough Democrats to vote to end the shutdown. Some Democrats called on Mr. McConnell to delay a procedural vote schedule for noon.
The crux issue, it seemed, was whether the majority leader could be trusted to keep his word. Democrats have not forgiven Mr. McConnell for blocking the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick Garland for almost a year pending the election of a Republican to the White House. And Mr. McConnell’s promises to Republican Senators Flake and Susan Collins of Maine for votes on health care and immigration in exchange for their support of the tax cut have yet to materialize.
How much of the issue is that mistrust?
“Uh, most of it,” said Senator Joseph Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia.
— Nicholas Fandos
Liberal activists weren’t ready to relent.
A broad array of liberal advocacy groups — including unions and immigrants’ rights activists — stepped up pressure on Democrats not to accede on Monday to any deal that does not include protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.
The advocates made clear that they do not trust Mr. McConnell.
“To anyone considering such a move, let me clear, promises won’t protect anyone from deportation, because delay means deportation for us,” said Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for America’s Voice, an immigrant rights group.
Moderate Senate Democrats on Monday were seeking a firmer commitment from Mr. McConnell. But the groups remained skeptical. Vanita Gutpta, the president and chief executive officer of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, harked back to Democrats’ vote on Friday to block a spending bill that would have kept the government open, without protecting the Dreamers.
“We’ve made it clear that the broad progressive movement is unified in saying the Democrats stood strong on Friday, they absolutely need to continue to do so,” Ms. Gupta said. She added, “Simply put a dream deferred right now is a dream denied for hundreds of thousands in our country.” The Sierra Club’s executive director, Michael Brune, was blunt: “Everyone in the Senate should have learned the lesson Senators Flake and Collins learned: you can’t trust Mitch McConnell. His promises are empty from the start.”

The White House comment line has an attitude.
On Monday morning, a telephone call to the White House comment line reminded callers that the federal government was shutdown and offered the Trump administration’s explanation for why: “Unfortunately, we cannot answer your call today because congressional Democrats are holding government funding for our troops and other national security priorities hostage to an unrelated immigration debate,” a recording said. “Due to this obstruction the government is shut down.” Setting aside the partisan nature of the call, its message is only half true, if that. Most of the government is functioning, at least for now. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Federal Communications Commission say they have enough money in the pipeline to operate normally. The White House ordered the National Parks to stay open, depriving the media of the most obvious signs of dysfunction.
Even Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election and any possible collusion with the Trump campaign, is still in action. He has declared his investigators “essential employees.”

Breitbart,"El Paso Sector Border Patrol officials report that at least 2,500 migrants illegally crossed the border along a small section of the New Mexico Border. The migrants crossed the border this fiscal year as part of large groups of Central American families and unaccompanied minors near the Antelope Wells Port of Entry.
In an area that normally only sees a few hundred illegal border crossings per year, El Paso Sector officials reported that 25 large groups of migrants crossed the border near the Antelope Wells Port of Entry in the first few months of Fiscal Year 2019. The Border Patrol defines a “large group” as more than 100 people, FOX14 reported.
This small section of the border is patrolled by agents assigned to the Lordsburg Station. Due to the remoteness of this area, agents are assigned to work from Camp Bounds Forward Operating Base at Antelope Wells, New Mexico. The Lordsburg Station falls under the supervision of the El Paso Sector.
During the entirety of Fiscal Year 2018, which ended on September 30, 2018, the El Paso Sector reported apprehending a total of 31,561 migrants. Those included 12,312 family units and 5,461 unaccompanied minors, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s 2018 Southwest Border Migration Report. Officials told OutletName News in December that the Lordsburg station’s apprehensions represent a small portion of those numbers. And, the Camp Bounds Forward Operating Base, located in the extreme southwestern part of the New Mexico boot heel, accounted for a small portion of that.
However, since the new fiscal year began on October 1, 2018, at least 25 groups of more than 100 migrants have been apprehended. OutletName14 reported that Border Patrol agents apprehended nearly 300 migrants last week alone — one group of 247 and a second group of 115.
Officials told the local OutletName affiliate that smugglers have started using the large groups of migrants as a distraction to tie up Border Patrol agents while they smuggle drugs across the border elsewhere.
Officials said that at about the same time the agents engaged with this very large group of migrants, drug smugglers reportedly moved a load of 265 pounds of marijuana across the border west of Antelope Wells.
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the pressure on Border Patrol agents due to the unsecured border is pushing the system “to a breaking point.”
Now it appears that drug smugglers are attempting to take advantage of the overwhelming nature of the crisis at our southern border by exploiting these families and children and pushing them to remote and desolate areas of the border to make their crossing.

President Donald Trump believes a border wall can stop undocumented immigrants.
But in a 2004 speech resurfaced by “The Daily Show,” Trump had some different thoughts on walls, at least when it comes to the metaphorical type.
“Never ever give up,” he urged graduates at Wagner College on New York’s Staten Island:
“Don’t give up. Don’t allow it to happen. If there’s a concrete wall in front of you, go through it, go over it, go around it, but get to the other side of that wall.”
Maybe that’s why he recently shifted from a “concrete” wall to one with “steel slats.”
See his full 2004 commencement address here. His comments about walls are at 12:35.
Trump was awarded an honorary degree for delivering the address. Since his election, however, at least 33 Wagner professors and more than 700 alumni have called on the school to rescind the degree.","oh man, once trump gets his wall he better hope no one shows mexico this old video we found. pic. twitter. com / ftzeglmecz president donald trump believes a border wall can stop undocumented immigrants. but in a 2004 speech resurfaced by “ the daily show, ” trump had some different thoughts on walls, at least when it comes to the metaphorical type. “ never ever give up, ” he urged graduates at wagner college on new york ’ s staten island : “ don ’ t give up. don ’ t allow it to happen. if there ’ s a concrete wall in front of you, go through it, go over it, go around it, but get to the other side of that wall. ” maybe that ’ s why he recently shifted from a “ concrete ” wall to one with “ steel slats. ” see his full 2004 commencement address here. his comments about walls are at 12 : 35. trump was awarded an honorary degree for delivering the address. since his election, however, at least 33 wagner professors and more than 700 alumni have called on the school to rescind the degree.",0.999980688095092,0.49998064445208,1,178,4.49,4.49,6.74,0.56,4.49,1.69,9.55,1.69,2.25,1.12,1.69,0.0,3.93,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.49,0.0,0.0,2.81,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.56,0.0,12.92,2.25,11.8,1.12,0.0,0.0,5.62,2.81,2.81,0.56,1.6853932584269662,6.741573033707865,1.6853932584269662
Daily Caller,"Well over half of young Republican voters think illegal immigrants should be offered a path to U.S. citizenship if they meet “certain conditions,” according to a new poll from the Public Religion Research Institute.
The PRRI’s American Values Atlas found that Republicans in the 18 to 29 age cohort have a significantly more liberal outlook than their older counterparts on the citizenship question, reflecting generational differences found across the American electorate regardless of party affiliation.
Among all Republicans, support for a path to citizenship stands at about 55 percent. When only Republicans between the ages of 18 to 29 are surveyed, that figure rises to 62 percent.
Young Republicans also take a softer line than older generations on other immigration-related questions, according to the PRRI poll.
When asked about discrimination against immigrants in the U.S., 41 percent of Republicans of all ages say immigrants face discrimination “a lot,” but the figure jumps to 60 percent among the youngest cohort of Republican voters. In contrast, only about a third of GOP voters 65 and older think immigrants experience discrimination.
Among all Americans, 63 percent say there’s a lot of discrimination against immigrants, but GOP voters between the ages of 18 and 29 are the only subgroup of Republicans in which a majority of respondents agree with that assertion.
The split between young and old Republicans on immigration questions is in keeping with a more permissive attitude among younger generations about a range of issues including gay marriage and multiculturalism, according to PRRI surveys. Many young Republicans believe increased diversity is a net benefit to the U.S.
Ryan Kromsky, a former University of Maryland student and co-founder of the school’s Progressive College Republicans, believes immigrants should be welcomed with “open arms” because they are “hard workers, bright students and aspiring capitalists.”
“Closed-minded Republicans need to expand their perspective to see how immigrants are helping us all create a better America,” the 24-year-old financial systems analyst told the Associated Press. “I believe that this will change with the younger generation of Republicans.”
The American Values Atlas poll results come from 40,509 interviews conducted by telephone, including 24,266 interviews via mobile phones, between May 18, 2016, and January 10, 2017. The margin of error is plus or minus 0.6 percentage points.","well over half of young republican voters think illegal immigrants should be offered a path to u. s. citizenship if they meet “ certain conditions, ” according to a new poll from the public religion research institute. the prri ’ s american values atlas found that republicans in the 18 to 29 age cohort have a significantly more liberal outlook than their older counterparts on the citizenship question, reflecting generational differences found across the american electorate regardless of party affiliation. among all republicans, support for a path to citizenship stands at about 55 percent. when only republicans between the ages of 18 to 29 are surveyed, that figure rises to 62 percent. young republicans also take a softer line than older generations on other immigration - related questions, according to the prri poll. when asked about discrimination against immigrants in the u. s., 41 percent of republicans of all ages say immigrants face discrimination “ a lot, ” but the figure jumps to 60 percent among the youngest cohort of republican voters. in contrast, only about a third of gop voters 65 and older think immigrants experience discrimination. among all americans, 63 percent say there ’ s a lot of discrimination against immigrants, but gop voters between the ages of 18 and 29 are the only subgroup of republicans in which a majority of respondents agree with that assertion. the split between young and old republicans on immigration questions is in keeping with a more permissive attitude among younger generations about a range of issues including gay marriage and multiculturalism, according to prri surveys. many young republicans believe increased diversity is a net benefit to the u. s. ryan kromsky, a former university of maryland student and co - founder of the school ’ s progressive college republicans, believes immigrants should be welcomed with “ open arms ” because they are “ hard workers, bright students and aspiring capitalists. ” “ closed - minded republicans need to expand their perspective to see how immigrants are helping us all create a better america, ” the 24 - year - old financial systems analyst told the associated press. “ i believe that this will change with the younger generation of republicans. ” the american values atlas poll results come from 40, 509 interviews conducted by telephone, including 24, 266 interviews via mobile phones, between may 18, 2016, and january 10, 2017. the margin of error is plus or minus 0. 6 percentage points.",4.36134505434e-05,0.499956369400024,0,391,6.39,6.65,4.86,1.53,1.53,2.05,9.97,3.58,1.28,0.77,1.28,0.0,4.09,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.46,0.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26,0.0,3.07,0.51,0.26,0.77,0.0,0.0,0.26,0.0,0.0,0.26,0.0,7.93,0.51,6.14,1.28,0.0,0.26,7.67,1.79,2.3,0.26,6.3938618925831205,7.41687979539642,0.0
HuffPost,"President Donald Trump has long employed undocumented workers at his New Jersey golf club despite his racist and anti-immigration policies and rhetoric, according to a new Washington Post investigation.
The Post reported Friday it located more than a dozen workers in Costa Rica who said they were undocumented when they worked at Trump’s country club in Bedminster as groundskeepers, housekeepers and dishwashers.
The former workers said their supervisors at the Trump club knew of their undocumented status, and some managers discussed obtaining fake documents.
“This golf course was built by illegals,” Dario Angulo, who said he was an $8-an-hour grounds crew worker at Trump’s resort, told the newspaper.
The former workers said dozens of other undocumented immigrants worked at the Bedminster resort, often following family members and friends there. Other undocumented workers came from El Salvador, Mexico and Guatemala, among other Latin American countries, which Trump has regularly denigrated.

FoxNews,"Outside Brownsville, the 'wall' is made of rust-colored steel bars embedded in concrete. Elsewhere, it's a mix of steel and metal mesh.
In other spots across the southwest, it's nothing at all.
The southern border barrier that separates the U.S. from Mexico is in fact a mishmash of materials that stops and starts at various points across hundreds of miles. OutletNameNews.com visited one patchy section in southern Texas. Together, the inconsistencies show how big a task President-elect Donald Trump would be taking on if he pursues his ‘big, beautiful wall’ on the border.
Skeptics are hardly in short supply in this region.
In border city Brownsville, Democratic Mayor Tony Martinez is convinced a wall won’t work.
“It just boggles the mind,” he told OutletNameNews.com. “Why are we playing this charade? It’s a form of deception to the American people.”
CARTELS EXPLOIT BORDER WALL FEARS
Opinions in border communities like Del Rio, Laredo, Brownsville, Mission and McAllen are split. While almost everyone OutletNameNews.com spoke with said security needs to be beefed up, they question whether the wall is feasible.
Given the inconsistent barrier in place now, residents could be forgiven for having a hard time visualizing the kind of epic construction feat Trump wants to achieve.
The U.S.-Mexico border, all told, stretches more than 1,900 miles from the coast of California to the southern tip of Texas. Right now, 654 miles of that has fencing of some kind.
The kind of fence varies from location to location.
The El Paso sector, for example, uses “post-on-rail” steel set in concrete in some sections and a steel mesh fence in others. In San Diego, a bollard fence with cantilever – the kind used for federal buildings – is in place. In Yuma, it’s a metal mesh fence.
But the landscape along the south Texas border is diverse and unlike parts of New Mexico, Arizona, California, it zig-zags through the river, and cuts through people’s backyards, farmers’ fields and even the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley campus.
“It’s really a totally stupid thing,” Cameron County Sherriff Omar Lucio told OutletNameNews.com of the current set-up. “It’s 10 feet high and has huge openings.”
Lucio, who is responsible for protecting a large swath of south Texas, says some border crossers skip the wall altogether and use the mouth of the Rio Grande River to raft across from Matamoros, Mexico -- something a border wall might not be able to stop, either.
Illegal immigrants also can take advantage of other gaps in the wall along terrain too tough or expansive to patrol regularly.
“Most agents are in favor of some sort of wall or fence, although a wall alone won’t make the country safer,” Jon Anfinsen, president of Local 2366 of the National Border Patrol Council, told OutletNameNews.com. “There are other sectors that will simply not support a wall because of the terrain, so a wall has to be combined with new technology and additional manpower to make the country safer.”
Anfinsen says while other sectors could support a wall on most or all of its border in their areas, his is “too hilly to feasibly make a wall on its entire stretch of border.”
The border fence was authorized under the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican-controlled Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. The legislation OK’d hundreds of miles of fencing along the Mexico border.
Since then, it’s been tweaked. Then-Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison pushed a measure that would give the Department of Homeland Security the authority to decide what type of fence should go up in different areas – the reason why there are so many different types of border barriers in place today.
As the border was being redrawn – in south Texas, it’s almost 2 miles north of the natural border of the Rio Grande River – people who had homes or businesses there paid the price.
Ray Loop’s family farm sits at the southernmost point along the border. Big, rusty 18-foot high steel bars courtesy of the federal government now dissect sections of it.
There are also gaps – lots of them, which border crossers use to make it over. Sometimes, they’ll hide in his citrus bushes waiting for the all clear. If that doesn’t work, they climb over on parts of the border that are lower.
“It takes them about a minute and a half to climb the wall,” he said.
Brownsville’s mayor showed OutletNameNews.com some of the holes in the wall. In one spot, the rust-colored bars end and a much shorter green fence begins. It’s easily traversable by migrant workers, asylum seekers, drug smugglers and human traffickers.
But Martinez says building a bigger, better wall like Trump has proposed won’t stop those determined to make it into U.S. territory.
Instead, he believes cross-border communication with Mexican authorities would go a long way toward cutting down on illegal immigration.
Cindy Johnson, a deaconess at United Methodist Women in Brownsville who works with illegal immigrants, agrees. As a lifelong resident of Brownsville, she urged Washington lawmakers against rushing to judgment on the benefits of a border wall.
“Lawmakers who’ve never even visited border communities shouldn’t be determining their futures,” Johnson told OutletNameNews.com.","outside brownsville, the'wall'is made of rust - colored steel bars embedded in concrete. elsewhere, it's a mix of steel and metal mesh. in other spots across the southwest, it's nothing at all. the southern border barrier that separates the u. s. from mexico is in fact a mishmash of materials that stops and starts at various points across hundreds of miles. outletnamenews. com visited one patchy section in southern texas. together, the inconsistencies show how big a task president - elect donald trump would be taking on if he pursues his ‘ big, beautiful wall ’ on the border. skeptics are hardly in short supply in this region. in border city brownsville, democratic mayor tony martinez is convinced a wall won ’ t work. “ it just boggles the mind, ” he told outletnamenews. com. “ why are we playing this charade? it ’ s a form of deception to the american people. ” cartels exploit border wall fears opinions in border communities like del rio, laredo, brownsville, mission and mcallen are split. while almost everyone outletnamenews. com spoke with said security needs to be beefed up, they question whether the wall is feasible. given the inconsistent barrier in place now, residents could be forgiven for having a hard time visualizing the kind of epic construction feat trump wants to achieve. the u. s. - mexico border, all told, stretches more than 1, 900 miles from the coast of california to the southern tip of texas. right now, 654 miles of that has fencing of some kind. the kind of fence varies from location to location. the el paso sector, for example, uses “ post - on - rail ” steel set in concrete in some sections and a steel mesh fence in others. in san diego, a bollard fence with cantilever – the kind used for federal buildings – is in place. in yuma, it ’ s a metal mesh fence. but the landscape along the south texas border is diverse and unlike parts of new mexico, arizona, california, it zig - zags through the river, and cuts through people ’ s backyards, farmers ’ fields and even the university of texas rio grande valley campus. “ it ’ s really a totally stupid thing, ” cameron county sherriff omar lucio told outletnamenews. com of the current set - up. “ it ’ s 10 feet high and has huge openings.",9.86628001555e-05,0.499901294708252,0,377,1.59,4.77,2.65,1.06,0.8,0.8,9.28,1.33,1.33,1.06,1.59,0.53,4.24,0.0,0.53,0.27,0.0,0.0,6.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,0.53,0.53,1.86,0.0,0.0,0.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27,0.27,15.65,0.27,14.06,1.06,0.0,0.27,2.12,2.65,5.84,0.53,3.6939313984168867,8.443271767810026,0.2638522427440633
NYTimes,"“I understand his feelings about it, because this has been a big distraction for him,” Mr. Sessions said of the Russia inquiry. Nonetheless, he said he had followed the recommendation of the Justice Department’s ethics lawyers when he recused himself.
""An attorney general who doesn’t follow the law is not very effective in leading the Department of Justice,” Mr. Sessions said. “Knowing the integrity that’s required of the attorney general, I believe I made the right decision.”
He also expressed sympathy for Mr. Trump. “He has had a lot of criticism and he’s steadfast, determined to get his job done,” Mr. Sessions said. He said the president “wants all of us to do our job, and that’s what I intend to do.” Mr. Sessions said he intends to step up prosecutions and leak investigations — priorities he said had already begun. Leaks, in particular, “cannot continue, so people need to go to jail,” Mr. Sessions said. “The president has every right to ask the Department of Justice to be more aggressive in that, and we intend to.”
Speaking in El Salvador, where he had traveled to meet with Salvadoran government officials to discuss the transnational MS-13 gang, Mr. Sessions also told The Associated Press he had not had the “best week.” But he said he retained a “harmony of value and beliefs” with Mr. Trump.
Immigration is a signature issue for Mr. Sessions. He has tied undocumented immigrants in the United States to violent crime, and made prosecutions of gangs, drugs and gun violations among his top priorities at the Justice Department. His trip to El Salvador on Thursday, coinciding with the Salvadoran government’s announcement of hundreds of gang-member prosecutions, came as Mr. Trump himself prepared to deliver a speech on Long Island regarding MS-13 gang violence on Friday.
But even as the president and his attorney general appeared aligned in their messages on MS-13, their relationship itself was far from repaired.
Mr. Sessions told OutletName he did not have any upcoming conversations with the president on his calendar. “But I believe that I understand his mission,” he said. “I understand his goals — that’s why I supported him for president.”
He also made clear, not yet six full months into his job, that he was well aware his time as the nation’s top law enforcement official could still come to an end at any moment. “I serve at the pleasure of the president,” he said. “I’ve understood that from the day I took the job.”","“ i understand his feelings about it, because this has been a big distraction for him, ” mr. sessions said of the russia inquiry. nonetheless, he said he had followed the recommendation of the justice department ’ s ethics lawyers when he recused himself.

NYTimes,"President Trump lashed out at undocumented immigrants during a White House meeting on Wednesday, warning in front of news cameras that dangerous people were clamoring to breach the country’s borders and branding such people “animals.” Mr. Trump’s comments came during a round-table discussion with state and local leaders on California’s so-called sanctuary laws, which strictly limit communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers, and which the Trump administration is suing to invalidate. It was hardly the first time the president has spoken in racially fraught terms about immigrants, but it underscored his anger about unchecked immigration — the animating issue of his campaign and his tenure so far — and his frustration that he has not been able to do more to seal the nation’s borders. As he has in numerous private meetings with his advisers at the White House, Mr. Trump used the session to vent about the nation’s immigration laws, calling them “the dumbest laws on immigration in the world.” He exhorted his administration to “do much better” in keeping out undesirable people, including members of transnational gangs like MS-13. “We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — we’re stopping a lot of them,” Mr. Trump said in the Cabinet Room during an hourlong meeting that reporters were allowed to document. “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people, these are animals, and we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before.” Mr. Trump’s remarks came as the local officials invited for the event took turns praising his immigration policies and lamenting California’s law, arguing that it was making it more difficult for their communities to find and deport criminals. Sheriff Margaret Mims of Fresno County said the statute barred Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities from using her databases “to find the bad guys,” or from entering prisons to locate people who might be in the country illegally. “It’s really put us in a very bad position,” Sheriff Mims said. “It’s a disgrace,” Mr. Trump answered, “and we’re suing on that.” The president’s language and his focus on California drew a sharp rebuke from Jerry Brown, the state’s Democratic governor. “Trump is lying on immigration, lying about crime and lying about the laws of California,” Mr. Brown said in a statement. “Flying in a dozen Republican politicians to flatter him and praise his reckless policies changes nothing. We, the citizens of the fifth-largest economy in the world, are not impressed.” During the session, Mr. Trump suggested that the mayor of Oakland, Calif., should be charged with obstruction of justice for warning her constituents in February of an impending large-scale immigration raid and arrests. “You talk about obstruction of justice,” said the president, who is himself the subject of a special counsel’s investigation into whether he sought to thwart a federal examination of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 elections. “I would recommend that you look into obstruction of justice for the mayor of Oakland.” Turning to Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, who sat at the other end of the large wooden conference table, Mr. Trump said: “Perhaps the Department of Justice can look into that.” The round table took place exactly one week after Mr. Trump used a closed-door cabinet meeting to castigate Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, for failing to do enough to crack down at the border. On Wednesday, Ms. Nielsen said little when called upon to speak, other than to thank Mr. Trump for his leadership on the issue. “You’re doing a good job, and it’s not an easy job,” Mr. Trump told Ms. Nielsen. He alluded to a recent push by his administration that parents be separated from their children when families cross illegally into the United States, but blamed Democrats — many of whom have vehemently opposed the practice — for the new policy. “I know what you’re going through right now with families is very tough, but those are the bad laws that the Democrats gave us,” Mr. Trump said. “We have to break up families. The Democrats gave us that law.” The president also took aim at Mexico as unhelpful on immigration. “Mexico does nothing for us,” Mr. Trump said. “Mexico talks, but they do nothing for us, especially at the border. Certainly don’t help us much on trade, but especially at the border, they do nothing for us.” His harsh criticism came as American and Mexican officials were at a critical stage in their efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Trump’s heated remarks on immigration, both private and public, appear to have resonated with his advisers, who have been moving to put in place ever-stricter policies in line with the president’s vision. Mr. Sessions said the Department of Justice would be adding immigration judges and prosecuting twice as many immigration cases this year. “The president has made clear to all of us that we have to do better,” he said. “We are going to do better.” The attorney general, a former senator who helped to derail previous attempts at revamping immigration laws, also expressed hope that a legislative overhaul could be enacted this year, although Republicans on Capitol Hill have shown little appetite for undertaking one. “This is the year that we have to move Congress,” Mr. Sessions said.","president trump lashed out at undocumented immigrants during a white house meeting on wednesday, warning in front of news cameras that dangerous people were clamoring to breach the country ’ s borders and branding such people “ animals. ” mr. trump ’ s comments came during a round - table discussion with state and local leaders on california ’ s so - called sanctuary laws, which strictly limit communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers, and which the trump administration is suing to invalidate. it was hardly the first time the president has spoken in racially fraught terms about immigrants, but it underscored his anger about unchecked immigration — the animating issue of his campaign and his tenure so far — and his frustration that he has not been able to do more to seal the nation ’ s borders. as he has in numerous private meetings with his advisers at the white house, mr. trump used the session to vent about the nation ’ s immigration laws, calling them “ the dumbest laws on immigration in the world. ” he exhorted his administration to “ do much better ” in keeping out undesirable people, including members of transnational gangs like ms - 13. “ we have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — we ’ re stopping a lot of them, ” mr. trump said in the cabinet room during an hourlong meeting that reporters were allowed to document. “ you wouldn ’ t believe how bad these people are. these aren ’ t people, these are animals, and we ’ re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that ’ s never happened before. ” mr. trump ’ s remarks came as the local officials invited for the event took turns praising his immigration policies and lamenting california ’ s law, arguing that it was making it more difficult for their communities to find and deport criminals. sheriff margaret mims of fresno county said the statute barred immigration and customs enforcement authorities from using her databases “ to find the bad guys, ” or from entering prisons to locate people who might be in the country illegally. “ it ’ s really put us in a very bad position, ” sheriff mims said. “ it ’ s a disgrace, ” mr. trump answered, “ and we ’ re suing on that. ” the president ’ s language and his focus on california drew a sharp rebuke from jerry brown, the state ’ s democratic governor. “ trump is lying on immigration, lying about crime and lying about the laws of california,",0.999977469444274,0.499977449208018,1,403,0.5,2.73,8.93,1.99,0.99,5.96,4.96,1.24,1.24,0.25,0.99,0.25,1.49,0.0,2.23,0.0,1.24,0.0,18.61,0.0,0.0,0.5,4.22,0.0,0.74,2.48,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,11.17,1.74,8.19,0.74,0.0,0.0,2.23,3.97,1.99,0.25,7.444168734491314,9.67741935483871,1.488833746898263

Daily Caller,"MSOutletName’s Joe Scarborough compared Wednesday’s White House press briefing immigration spat to Hitler’s famous autobiography on “Morning Joe” Thursday.
“Where things seem to really melt down was when Jim Acosta talked, and we’re not, we’re certainly not putting this on Jim Acosta … but when Jim Acosta used the language, that it seems like your polices are trying to engineer racial and ethnic percentages or something, it sure sounded like something that you would read out of like ‘Mein Kampf or something,” Scarborough said.
OutletName White House Correspondent Jim Acosta debated with senior White House adviser Stephen Miller over concerns that the Trump administration would discriminate and try to push social engineering. Acosta raised concerns that immigrants from English speaking countries like Great Britain and Australia would get preferential treatment, while minority communities would be marginalized.

Commentary magazine editor and “Morning Joe” panelist John Podhoretz mocked Acosta’s reference to the Statue of Liberty and said, “Having a reporter yammer at a White House official by quoting Emma Lazarus’ poem at the base of the State of Liberty as though that’s the basis for policy, something written in 1883, we’re living in 2017 … it was so obnoxious.”

HuffPost,"Federal immigration officials are not adequately policing contractors running immigrant detention centers where serious problems are often going unreported, according to a report the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security released last week.
In some cases, contractors ― including both private businesses and public operations, such as county jails ― failed to notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement of sexual assaults and employee misconduct, the IG report said.
“Instead of holding facilities accountable through financial penalties, ICE issued waivers to facilities with deficient conditions,” the report said.
The report said one facility, for example, was granted a waiver that allowed detainees with serious criminal histories to be held near those with nonviolent offenses. Another facility was granted a waiver to use tear gas instead of pepper spray, which is less toxic, according to the IG report.

ICE issued only two fines to contractors between October 2015 and June 2018, despite finding more than 14,000 deficiencies in that time period, the IG reported. One facility was fined for repeated deficiencies in health care; another for failing to pay proper wages.
The fines amounted to $3.9 million — or 0.13 percent of the more than $3 billion ICE paid to contractors during that period, the report noted.
ICE approved 65 waivers allowing facilities to ignore contract requirements — most for indefinite time periods ― between September 2016 and July 2018.
The investigation examined 106 detention facilities run by contractors that hold about 25,000 detainees daily. ICE has about 45,670 immigrants in detention each day.
ICE said in a letter accompanying the report that it has a “strong record of holding detention facilities accountable when deficiencies are identified.” It agreed, however, to improve oversight.","federal immigration officials are not adequately policing contractors running immigrant detention centers where serious problems are often going unreported, according to a report the inspector general for the department of homeland security released last week. in some cases, contractors ― including both private businesses and public operations, such as county jails ― failed to notify immigration and customs enforcement of sexual assaults and employee misconduct, the ig report said. “ instead of holding facilities accountable through financial penalties, ice issued waivers to facilities with deficient conditions, ” the report said. the report said one facility, for example, was granted a waiver that allowed detainees with serious criminal histories to be held near those with nonviolent offenses. another facility was granted a waiver to use tear gas instead of pepper spray, which is less toxic, according to the ig report. new! doesn ’ t fully use tools to hold # detentioncenters # contractors accountable for failing to meet standards. # ice doesn ’ t track discrepancy reports & rarely imposes financial consequences, when deficiencies could result in safety / health risks : : / / t. co / 2d1e2trjha — dhsoig ( ) february 4, 2019 ice issued only two fines to contractors between october 2015 and june 2018, despite finding more than 14, 000 deficiencies in that time period, the ig reported. one facility was fined for repeated deficiencies in health care ; another for failing to pay proper wages. the fines amounted to $ 3. 9 million — or 0. 13 percent of the more than $ 3 billion ice paid to contractors during that period, the report noted. ice approved 65 waivers allowing facilities to ignore contract requirements — most for indefinite time periods ― between september 2016 and july 2018. the investigation examined 106 detention facilities run by contractors that hold about 25, 000 detainees daily. ice has about 45, 670 immigrants in detention each day. ice said in a letter accompanying the report that it has a “ strong record of holding detention facilities accountable when deficiencies are identified. ” it agreed, however, to improve oversight.",0.999979853630065,0.499979823196554,1,323,7.74,7.74,8.36,0.31,1.24,6.81,8.36,1.24,1.86,0.62,0.93,0.31,3.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.95,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.26,2.48,0.0,1.55,0.93,0.0,0.31,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.93,5.57,0.93,3.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.12,3.41,1.86,0.31,2.476780185758514,10.8359133126935,1.8575851393188854
Breitbart,"Many mainstream news outlets appear to be purposely and dishonestly overlooking key facts about the U.S.-Mexico border region in order to push a false narrative about a safe border.
OutletName Border and Cartel Chronicles Director Brandon Darby took on the recent reporting by OutletName’s Jim Acosta and some social media postings by Texas Democrat Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke, where they try to claim the border, is safe. Darby’s statements were part of his recent interview with OutletName News Tonight.
In the case of Jim Acosta, Darby criticized the OutletName correspondent video report where he stands next to the border fence claiming the area is safe. What Acosta did not report on was the constant gun battles in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, just south of his location. He also did not report that just one day before, authorities in Mexico discovered 17 charred bodies in the town of Miguel Aleman — an area about 60 miles west of where he was standing.
“For him to do that, is so dishonest, it is outright propaganda,” Darby said.
Darby also spoke about social media postings by O’Rourke who continually claims that the whole border is safe.
“Well there are some places along the border that are safe like El Paso,” Darby stated. “They are safe because there is a wall, there is already a steel barrier there. In contrast. in Ciudad Juarez, the Mexican side of the El Paso- Juarez Metropolitan Area … it is one of the most violent places on earth. If you look at the murder rates since 2009 there, it’s insane”
In their effort to portray the border as a safe region, the politician and the OutletName journalist overlook the fact that the border region is not only the U.S. side but also the Mexican side of the border. These regions are home to some of the most violent cities in the world.
“For them to intentionally parse their words in a way to not have to mention the violence, death, and depravity that is happening within a kilometer from there — it is propaganda,” Darby said. “It is a Potemkin village they are setting up, it is dishonest, and it further silences the communities in Mexico. It further silences everything the migrants go through to get here, it further silences the more than 50,000 family members of the victims the cartels have disappeared. It further silences the further silences the approximately 200,000 who have been killed by the cartels in Mexico. It is not ok that they are doing this, it is propaganda. “
One of the most alarming trends in the way national news reported border issues dealt with the statement by U.S. President Donald Trump that one in three women were sexually assaulted in their journey to the border.
“What have we become as a nation? What are our media folks doing?” Darby asked, referring to how that statement was ignored by most news outlets.
“The president was wrong,” Darby pointed out. “He said one out of three women migrant women were raped on their journey from Central America to the border. That is the lowest estimate — most groups put it between 70 and 80 percent.”
The difference in estimates deals with only a fraction of the women actually admitting they were abused, while the rest continue to suffer in silence, he explained.
According to Darby, most of the groups that work with migrant women operate under the assumption that all of the women that reach the shelters have been raped at some point along their journey.
“The fact is, the president said in an address that tens of thousands of migrants women have been sexually assaulted on their way to the border and no one is paying attention to that,” Darby said. “The border is not just the U.S. side the border region. It is the U.S. and Mexico side and it has some of the most dangerous areas in the world, just by looking at the data.”
In regards to the coverage about authorities being able to cut through border fences as part of the testing, Darby explained that the apparent lack of a blue-collar background by the outlets reporting it possibly led to them failing to mention that the readily available “Sawzall” tool that was used to cut the fence was extremely loud and takes a long time to cut through the steel beams.
“There is no substance that we can put on the wall that someone can’t put dynamite or use a blow torch to get through,” Darby said. “That is why you need roads, cameras, and agents nearby so that when people try to compromise the integrity of the wall, the fencing, the agents can respond.”","many mainstream news outlets appear to be purposely and dishonestly overlooking key facts about the u. s. - mexico border region in order to push a false narrative about a safe border. outletname border and cartel chronicles director brandon darby took on the recent reporting by outletname ’ s jim acosta and some social media postings by texas democrat robert francis “ beto ” o ’ rourke, where they try to claim the border, is safe. darby ’ s statements were part of his recent interview with outletname news tonight. in the case of jim acosta, darby criticized the outletname correspondent video report where he stands next to the border fence claiming the area is safe. what acosta did not report on was the constant gun battles in reynosa, tamaulipas, just south of his location. he also did not report that just one day before, authorities in mexico discovered 17 charred bodies in the town of miguel aleman — an area about 60 miles west of where he was standing. “ for him to do that, is so dishonest, it is outright propaganda, ” darby said. darby also spoke about social media postings by o ’ rourke who continually claims that the whole border is safe. “ well there are some places along the border that are safe like el paso, ” darby stated. “ they are safe because there is a wall, there is already a steel barrier there. in contrast. in ciudad juarez, the mexican side of the el paso - juarez metropolitan area … it is one of the most violent places on earth. if you look at the murder rates since 2009 there, it ’ s insane ” in their effort to portray the border as a safe region, the politician and the outletname journalist overlook the fact that the border region is not only the u. s. side but also the mexican side of the border. these regions are home to some of the most violent cities in the world. “ for them to intentionally parse their words in a way to not have to mention the violence, death, and depravity that is happening within a kilometer from there — it is propaganda, ” darby said. “ it is a potemkin village they are setting up, it is dishonest, and it further silences the communities in mexico. it further silences everything the migrants go through to get here, it further silences the more than 50, 000 family members of the victims the cartels have disappeared. it further silences the further silences the approximately 200, 000 who have",2.14249448617e-05,0.49997854232788,0,411,2.19,4.14,2.68,0.73,0.49,1.46,4.38,0.49,0.97,0.24,0.49,0.0,2.19,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.49,0.0,11.68,0.24,0.0,0.0,1.46,0.0,0.24,1.95,0.0,0.0,0.73,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.0,1.7,17.27,0.49,16.06,0.49,0.0,0.0,2.43,3.16,4.38,0.49,6.81265206812652,6.326034063260341,3.1630170316301705
FoxNews,"More than 1,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents near the U.S.-Mexico border early Wednesday -- the largest ever group of migrants ever apprehended at a single time, sources told OutletName on Thursday. The group of 1,036 illegal immigrants found in the El Paso sector included migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, according to sources. The group was the largest group of migrants ever apprehended at a single time, sources told OutletName. The discovery was made in the El Paso section of the southern border – which provides support for the counties of El Paso and Hudspeth in the state of Texas and the entire state of New Mexico.  The record apprehension comes as the U.S. Border Patrol said Tuesday it's working to hire additional staff to manage the processing of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Right now, stations are overwhelmed with the influx of migrant families, as officials say are agents encountering more and larger groups of more than 100 people dropped in extremely remote locations along the Southwest border. Officials said the aim of beefing up staff is to take the burden off uniformed agents, who can then go back into the field. Agents said they are spending more than half their time feeding and caring for migrant families. Paperwork processing alone can take three hours per family. There were 58,474 families apprehended last month, according to CBP. In March, the agency said that there was an increase of nearly 106 percent over the same period last year. A top Border Patrol official told lawmakers in April that authorities have apprehended more families illegally crossing the border between October 2018 and February of this year than during all of the 2018 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 2017-Sept. 30, 2018).

Agents must pass a detailed background check and a lie detector test that has been required since 2012 is a major hurdle, with just a 28% pass rate between 2013 and 2016.

FoxNews,"Two hunters accused in a shooting on a remote Texas ranch near the Mexican border had told authorities that they were attacked by immigrants who had entered the country illegally.
Presidio County Sheriff Danny Dominguez told Odessa television KOSA that a grand jury indicted Michael Bryant and Walker Daugherty last week on charges of using deadly conduct by discharging firearms in the direction of others.
The charges stem from a Jan. 6 incident where police responding to call about a shooting on a ranch near Candelaria found Daugherty and another man in the hunting party, Edwin Roberts, with gunshot wounds. The men were part of a group of hunters and told authorities they were attacked by people who had illegally crossed the nearby border and tried to steal an RV some of the hunters were using.

Breitbart,"A Republican-Democrat House and Senate committee is planning to offer President Trump a border security package that could include less than a quarter of the $5.7 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall he originally requested.
Capitol Hill sources tell the media that a conference committee of Republicans and Democrats is preparing to unveil a border security funding plan that gives only about $1.3 to $2 billion to Trump for construction of his proposed wall on the southern border to stop wage-crushing illegal immigration.
OutletName reports:
On Capitol Hill, House and Senate conferees were nearing an agreement that could offer the president between $1.3 billion and around $2 billion in funding for border security, a range, still subject to change, that could include some physical barriers and result in a deal as early as Monday. Talk of a wall has given way to “bollard fencing” and strategic placements. [Emphasis added]
This $1.3 to $2 billion would be the total spending for border security, meaning the funding for the proposed border wall would be a figure potentially less than $1.3 billion.
Despite previously committing that he would not accept anything less than $5 billion in funding for a border wall in a border security package, Trump is now telling lawmakers and aides that he is open to accepting just $2 billion for the wall, sources told the OutletName:
Mr. Trump has told allies he would grudgingly accept a figure of around $2 billion, but House Democrats remain publicly opposed to spending that much on physical barriers. It is still not clear how much of the final allocation would go for new fencing, according to three people briefed on the negotiations. [Emphasis added] … Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, told senators at a party lunch and in private conversations over the past few days that Mr. Trump had told him, “I can live with $2 billion,” according to a Senate aide who witnessed one of the exchanges. [Emphasis added]
The conference committee was formed after Trump reopened the federal government following a shutdown without securing any funding for the border wall. Members of the committee include:
Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, Texas Rep. Kay Granger, Tennesee Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, Georgia Rep. Tom Graves, and Mississippi Rep. Steven Palazzo, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, Illinois Sen. Richard Durbin, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, New York Rep. Nita Lowey, California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, North Carolina Rep. David Price, California Rep. Barbara Lee, Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, and California Rep. Pete Aguilar.
The committee was formed to work on a funding package for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with a deadline of February 15, a funding route that experts have said the president never had to take.
Defense Department officials have reiterated that Trump does not need approval from Congress and, also, does not have to declare a national emergency to begin construction of the border wall. Instead, the president could have invoked 10 United States Code § 284, which authorizes the U.S. military to build barriers at the southern border, a Pentagon official has testified to Congress.
Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) has urged Trump to invoke these executive powers to immediately begin building the border wall.
“I think what [Trump] needs to do now is Title 10 gives him authority to you know where there’s an active drug corridor … that the Department of Defense can access money and build a fence, I think he needs to do that … I think that needs to happen,” Biggs said last month.
Total construction of the proposed southern border wall would cost about $25 billion, far from the funding the GOP-Democrat committee is expected to offer. At the current rate, securing about $1.3 to $2 billion for the border wall would fund less than 205 miles of wall construction on the roughly 2,000-mile long U.S.-Mexico border.
While Congress and Trump haggle dally over border wall funding, mass illegal immigration has continued at the southern border. Border apprehension data from December 2018 reveal that the number of adults traveling to the southern border with children has skyrocketed by 280 percent compared to the same time last year.
Illegal immigration at the border, for December 2018, has increased 81 percent compared to this same month the year before. Additionally, between January 25 and February 15 — the period that Trump has given Congress to work on a border security package — there is likely to be anywhere between 30,000 to 44,000 illegal border crossings based on previous DHS totals. This is about 1,300 to 2,000 illegal crossings a day at the southern border.","a republican - democrat house and senate committee is planning to offer president trump a border security package that could include less than a quarter of the $ 5. 7 billion for a u. s. - mexico border wall he originally requested. capitol hill sources tell the media that a conference committee of republicans and democrats is preparing to unveil a border security funding plan that gives only about $ 1. 3 to $ 2 billion to trump for construction of his proposed wall on the southern border to stop wage - crushing illegal immigration. outletname reports : on capitol hill, house and senate conferees were nearing an agreement that could offer the president between $ 1. 3 billion and around $ 2 billion in funding for border security, a range, still subject to change, that could include some physical barriers and result in a deal as early as monday. talk of a wall has given way to “ bollard fencing ” and strategic placements.

Daily Caller,"The caravan of migrants from Central America seeking asylum in the U.S. has arrived at the border, and some people associated with the group have already been caught scaling the border fences. “Several groups of people associated with the Central American caravan” illegally entered the U.S. “by climbing over the dilapidated scrap metal border fence on either side of the San Ysidro Port of Entry,” Rodney S. Scott, chief of the Border Patrol in the San Diego sector, which sits just north of Tijuana, told reporters Saturday. He said the migrants included “children as young as 4 years old and in one case a pregnant female.” He called it “unconscionable that anyone would expose a child to these dangerous conditions.” Five busloads of migrants were escorted Sunday through Tijuana to a cross-border rally near San Diego, where supporters gathered on both sides of the fence, The Associated Press reports.

Breitbart,"Mark Zuckerberg’s immigration lobbyist says President Donald Trump’s 2016 voters will stick with him “100 percent” in 2020 if he signs amnesty legislation backed by the Koch business group.
“Polling and common sense dictates this to be true,” said a tweet from Todd Schulte, director of the FWD.US lobbying group, which is trying to preserve the federal policy of importing more than 1 million new consumers and workers each year. He continued:
People think the President is gonna see a bunch of people vote for a Dem or Howard Schultz if he signs a border and daca deal? This is not a real thing, just a scare tactic.
Schulte did not refer to the more likely result of a Trump-signed, Koch-backed amnesty bill: A sharp drop in enthusiasm and turnout for Trump in 2020.
That turnout slump likely would be seen among the blue-collar Americans hit by illegal migration and among the white-collar Americans who are slammed by U.S. companies’ employment of roughly 1.5 million college-educated, temporary visa workers.
Schulte’s FWD was created by Zuckerberg, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and a variety of investors to promote amnesty and cheap labor. The group backed the 2013 “Gang of Eight” amnesty which would have allowed an unlimited inflow of foreign graduates and has waged an expensive campaign against Trump’s 2016 campaign and his Inauguration Day “Hire American” promise.
Schulte’s tweet was also intended to defend former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who claimed on OutletName that Trump’s base would support a bill which combined a “DACA” amnesty with some wall-construction money.
Gingrich’s statement was slammed by author Ann Coulter and also by Mickey Kaus, who is a left-of-center, pro-American immigration reformer. Kaus Tweeted:
Newt wasn’t saying ignore Coulter, Trump’s base’ll be fine with no wall. He was saying ignore Coulter, Trump’s base’ll be fine with Koch/Kushner deal to LEGALIZE DREAMERS. Not so sure about that! (‘You voted Trump, you got amnesty!’)

Not so sure about that! ('You voted Trump, you got amnesty!') ://t.co/LfLmI3fYn7 — Mickey Kaus () January 28, 2019
In his OutletName interview on January 28, Gingrich backed an amnesty for illegals who crossed the border as children — dubbed “dreamers” by lobbyists and a friendly media. He endorsed an amnesty even though their numbers may exceed 3 million, even though an amnesty would eventually provide their illegal-immigrant parents with legal residency, and even though few would ever vote for GOP candidates.
Gingrich said:
I very much want to see [White House officials] take care of the dreamers as a part of this package, and I know, talking to [GOP Sen.] Lindsey Graham and others, there’s real interest in the Senate on a bipartisan basis to get a deal that takes care of the dreamers, takes care of the southern border, meets the President’s needs and gets signed … Is he going to veto a bill that includes [an amnesty]? I don’t think so. … He should not pay any attention to Ann Coulter. Ann Coulter has never run for office, she does not know anything about how you put a [congressional] majority together. She’s off here in some fantasy land where she gets to be noisy which helps her sell books. The fact is, the President’s base is with the President … If he goes to them and says “I’ve got this done for the wall, I’ve got this done to protect America, I’m doing these good things you believe in,” the base is going to say “Fine.” Eighty percent of the country believes he ought to find legal ways for people who came here as children to become legal in a way that is not necessarily a path to citizenship, but certainly a path to a job. Sometimes, you have got to say to your base “Hey, if you are really my base you’ve got to stick with me.”
However, the public is sharply opposed to a wall-for-amnesty deal. OutletName News reported January 28:
The latest Monmouth University Poll reveals that about 88 percent of voters said they oppose efforts to tie an amnesty for illegal aliens to border wall funding. Instead, voters said the issues should be dealt with separately. More than 80 percent of Republicans, 90 percent of swing-voters, and even 95 percent of Democrats said they oppose an amnesty-for-border wall deal. Non-college educated white voters, the base of President Trump’s support, massively oppose the amnesty-for-wall deal by about 88 percent. All voters without a college degree oppose the plan by about 89 percent, as well as 92 percent of minority voters.
Coulter — who has slammed Trump for failing to win much wall funding – quickly made fun of Gingrich’s claims by portraying him as a Trump sycophant:
The great thing about Newt is, you can always count on him to tell truth to power. — Ann Coulter () January 28, 2019
The same day, Schulte jumped in to defend Gingrich from Kaus and Coulter:
I mean…100% they would be. Polling and common sense dictates this to be true.

“People think the President is gonna see a bunch of people vote for a Dem or Howard Schultz if he signs a border and daca deal? This is not a real thing, just a scare tactic,” said Schulte.
Schulte is a Democrat who uses his Twitter account to boost Democratic candidates, dismiss GOP candidates and jeer at immigration reformers such as Coulter.
An objectively very very strong announcement week for . — Todd Schulte () January 27, 2019
In late January, Schulte stepped up his efforts to marginalize Coulter, Kaus and other advocates of Trump’s “Hire American” policy which has successfully pushed up wages for Americans. He tweeted:
The whole weird point is people like Ann Coulter have almost zero power. The President is the voice to those voters wishes — but he has people around him who tell him otherwise for their own agendas, and he has FOBL (Fear of Base Loss). But his perception is off. — Todd Schulte () January 26, 2019
Deportation jokes are offensive. Your math is stupid. If you weren’t just a racist entertainer you would run for President yourself but you know you would get crushed . ://t.co/jfcMPcTCKs — Todd Schulte () January 26, 2019
Schulte’s FWD.us backs the establishment’s economic policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth.
But that policy also shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white collar and blue collar foreign labor.
That annual flood of roughly one million legal immigrants — as well as visa workers and illegal immigrants — spikes profits and Wall Street values by shrinking salaries for 150 million blue-collar and white-collar employees, and especially wages for the four million young Americans who join the labor force each year.
Progressives offer more customers & revenue to investors if they help block Trump's 'public charge' merit-reform of the nation's process for picking immigrants. Lots of money and political power at stake. ://t.co/HJ7AyOT5hQ — Neil Munro () September 24, 2018
The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that coastal investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices and pushes poor U.S. Americans, including Latinos and blacks, out of prosperous cities such as Berkeley and Oakland.","mark zuckerberg ’ s immigration lobbyist says president donald trump ’ s 2016 voters will stick with him “ 100 percent ” in 2020 if he signs amnesty legislation backed by the koch business group. “ polling and common sense dictates this to be true, ” said a tweet from todd schulte, director of the fwd. us lobbying group, which is trying to preserve the federal policy of importing more than 1 million new consumers and workers each year. he continued : people think the president is gonna see a bunch of people vote for a dem or howard schultz if he signs a border and daca deal? this is not a real thing, just a scare tactic. schulte did not refer to the more likely result of a trump - signed, koch - backed amnesty bill : a sharp drop in enthusiasm and turnout for trump in 2020. that turnout slump likely would be seen among the blue - collar americans hit by illegal migration and among the white - collar americans who are slammed by u. s. companies ’ employment of roughly 1. 5 million college - educated, temporary visa workers. schulte ’ s fwd was created by zuckerberg, microsoft founder bill gates and a variety of investors to promote amnesty and cheap labor. the group backed the 2013 “ gang of eight ” amnesty which would have allowed an unlimited inflow of foreign graduates and has waged an expensive campaign against trump ’ s 2016 campaign and his inauguration day “ hire american ” promise. schulte ’ s tweet was also intended to defend former house speaker newt gingrich, who claimed on outletname that trump ’ s base would support a bill which combined a “ daca ” amnesty with some wall - construction money. gingrich ’ s statement was slammed by author ann coulter and also by mickey kaus, who is a left - of - center, pro - american immigration reformer. kaus tweeted : newt wasn ’ t saying ignore coulter, trump ’ s base ’ ll be fine with no wall. he was saying ignore coulter, trump ’ s base ’ ll be fine with koch / kushner deal to legalize dreamers. not so sure about that!

HuffPost,"With less than two hours to go before a deadline to avert a government shutdown, 48 senators blocked a four-week government spending extension, causing the government to partially shutdown at midnight.
Forty-four Democrats and four Republicans voted against the short-term spending bill that passed the House on Thursday evening, many of them saying they could not vote for a measure that does nothing for the 700,000 undocumented young people President Donald Trump has put at risk of losing protection from deportation.
As of midnight, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) still had not officially closed the vote, meaning the final tally could change. But it fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage.
Leaders in both chambers haven’t settled on a Plan B. There’s no deal to help so-called Dreamers and no agreement on an even shorter-term bill to extend funding while they work on one. Senators remained in the chamber discussing a path forward but didn’t find one before the deadline.
It will be difficult to reach a long-term deal to reopen the government. Democrats want protections for Dreamers first, but White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that’s not something the administration will discuss until government funding is approved.
“We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands,” she said in a statement just before midnight. “This is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators. When Democrats start paying our armed forces and first responders, we will reopen negotiations on immigration reform.”
It wasn’t just Democrats who voted against the bill. Four Republicans also opposed the four-week funding measure: Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky. John McCain of Arizona was not present.
Five Democrats crossed the aisle to vote for the bill: Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Doug Jones of Alabama, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Donnelly of Indiana.
Republicans also tried to shift blame to the Democrats for a potential shutdown by adding a six-year extension of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to their short-term bill. Then GOP leaders in the Senate decided to hold a vote on that funding measure even though it was clear minutes before that it didn’t have the support the pass ― essentially daring Democrats to vote no.
“The time to stop playing games is now,” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said on the Senate floor earlier Friday.
Trump, who necessitated a legislative fix for so-called Dreamers when he ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in September, accused Democrats of wanting “illegal immigration and weak borders” in a Friday morning tweet.
Republicans insisted there’s no urgency on immigration. But Democrats, at the urging of Dreamers themselves, stood firm, even though many of them voted for a spending bill in December. At a time when Trump is simultaneously insisting he wants an immigration deal and making demands that Democrats find difficult to stomach ― reportedly discussing immigrants in racist terms and insulting the lawmakers he is negotiating with ― they argued that tying DACA to government funding is the best chance they have to do so.
On Friday, ahead of the vote, Schumer went to the White House to meet with Trump to discuss the deal in person. He said after the meeting that they “made some progress, but we still have a good number of disagreements.”
Trump tweeted after the meeting that it was “excellent” but hours later was back to publicly bashing Democrats, accusing them of wanting “a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy.”
But it wasn’t just Democrats who blocked the bill, and DACA wasn’t the only thing keeping lawmakers from supporting the spending bill. Some senators said they wouldn’t vote for another one-month spending bill because they view it as an irresponsible way to run the government. Such measures, called continuing resolutions, are in lieu of a full-year bill to fund the government because lawmakers have yet to reach a deal.
Some lawmakers who opposed a four-week bill said they would support a shorter-term spending measure to keep the government open while they worked on a deal, but it’s unclear whether even that has enough votes to pass.
White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short told reporters before the vote that, if it failed, it was “kind of hard to see” how they would reach a deal by midnight.
Young people are set to begin losing DACA protections in larger numbers in early March, although about 122 per day have been losing their shield against deportation since Trump rescinded the program. (The government is currently accepting renewal applications because of a court order, but aims to have that ruling overturned.)
Negotiations on a deal for Dreamers hit a skid last week, when Trump reportedly made racist and derisive statements about immigrants from African nations and Haiti. (Trump has denied making those comments. However, he wants to eliminate a program that grants visas to many African immigrants and ended temporary protected status that allows some Haitians already in the U.S. to remain here.)
Trump also rejected a bipartisan proposal from senators, most prominently Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), intended to conform to the president’s demands. The White House hasn’t voiced support for a bipartisan House proposal from Reps. Will Hurd (R-Texas) and Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.). And a separate effort to find a deal between the second-ranking members in each party in the House and Senate hasn’t led to an agreement.
In the House, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) asked Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) earlier this week to told a vote on both the Hurd-Aguilar bill and a Republican-only bill led by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) that Democrats heavily oppose, but he said no.
Durbin called for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to hold a vote on his bipartisan bill, which seven Republicans are already backing.
“It’s ready,” he said on the Senate floor on Friday. “It’s ready to be brought to the floor of the United States Senate. It’s ready to be passed into law.”
Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) spun the night’s developments in a positive light, predicting the failed vote would eventually drive both sides to settle on a bipartisan compromise.
“This is what makes Congress work,” Hatch said. “Sooner or later they can get tired of it, then they’ll say let’s quit playing around and get something done.”","with less than two hours to go before a deadline to avert a government shutdown, 48 senators blocked a four - week government spending extension, causing the government to partially shutdown at midnight. forty - four democrats and four republicans voted against the short - term spending bill that passed the house on thursday evening, many of them saying they could not vote for a measure that does nothing for the 700, 000 undocumented young people president donald trump has put at risk of losing protection from deportation. as of midnight, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r - ky. ) still had not officially closed the vote, meaning the final tally could change. but it fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage. leaders in both chambers haven ’ t settled on a plan b. there ’ s no deal to help so - called dreamers and no agreement on an even shorter - term bill to extend funding while they work on one. senators remained in the chamber discussing a path forward but didn ’ t find one before the deadline. it will be difficult to reach a long - term deal to reopen the government. democrats want protections for dreamers first, but white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said that ’ s not something the administration will discuss until government funding is approved. “ we will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands, ” she said in a statement just before midnight. “ this is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators. when democrats start paying our armed forces and first responders, we will reopen negotiations on immigration reform. ” it wasn ’ t just democrats who voted against the bill. four republicans also opposed the four - week funding measure : sens. lindsey graham of south carolina, jeff flake of arizona, mike lee of utah and rand paul of kentucky. john mccain of arizona was not present. five democrats crossed the aisle to vote for the bill : joe manchin of west virginia, heidi heitkamp of north dakota, doug jones of alabama, claire mccaskill of missouri and joe donnelly of indiana. republicans also tried to shift blame to the democrats for a potential shutdown by adding a six - year extension of the children ’ s health insurance program ( chip ) to their short - term bill. then gop leaders in the senate decided to hold a vote on that funding measure even though it was clear minutes before that it didn ’ t have the support the pass ― essentially daring democrats to vote no. “ the time to stop playing games",0.999982118606567,0.499982104727678,1,422,3.79,6.16,6.87,1.18,1.18,4.74,6.4,0.95,0.71,0.95,0.47,0.0,3.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.82,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.47,0.47,3.32,1.9,0.0,0.24,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,1.9,5.92,1.42,4.5,0.24,0.0,0.0,7.35,4.27,0.95,1.42,4.739336492890995,9.47867298578199,1.4218009478672986

Daily Caller,"Normally, I drive across the border from San Diego, California, to and from Tijuana, Mexico. Recently, a broken arm prevented me from driving, so I joined the tens of thousands of Mexicans and Americans who walk through the San Diego Port of Entry at San Ysidro.
Mexico-bound drivers are rarely checked by Mexican Immigration, but pedestrians are regularly checked. Americans must present a passport. I use my passport “card” issued by the United States for land border crossings with Mexico and Canada.
One must be a U.S. citizen to have a U.S. passport or passport card. Such documents prove U.S. citizenship.
When the Mexican immigration officer looked at my card, she waved me through stating, “You are Mexican.” The card clearly states my birth nation as MEXICO. No interviews, no lawsuits or adjudication. My own U.S. passport declares me to be a Mexican citizen. Why?
Mexico has its own version of the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment. If a child is born in Mexico, the child is a Mexican citizen upon his or her 18th birthday. So, Mexico and the United States are, perhaps, the world’s most advanced constitutional republics.
Now, why can’t some people read and comprehend our laws and our Constitution? Don’t they understand its “supremacy” clause?
In a phrase, federal law trumps local and state law; federal law is supreme.
Specifically, it’s about arguments that American children born of undocumented immigrants should be denied natural-born citizenship; that they should be denied “due process” and “equal enforcement of the law.”
Article 1 of the 14th Amendment states clearly that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside…”
Anyone who argues that a child born to one or more illegal alien parents in the United States is not a U.S. citizen is wrong. Some say people who hold such views are brainless.
Further, anyone who claims these children and their undocumented parents are not under United States “jurisdiction” are constitutionally illiterate.
Can illegal aliens be arrested for crimes? Must their children have birth certificates? Must their children produce certificates of vaccination to enter school? Must they have a license to drive? Must the children attend school per laws in all states?
Has the Supreme Court considered this argument? Yes, many times. Let’s begin with the argument that the 14th Amendment applies only to Blacks who were pre-1863 slaves or their children. The Court dispensed with this argument in the Slaughterhouse Cases in the 1870s.
Insofar as specified constitutional rights, it ruled that laws apply to all, not just certain favored groups regardless of the circumstances or legislative intent.
The federal court dispensed with the racial argument involving Mexicans in IN RE RICARDO RODRIGUEZ . The racial element argument that Mexicans were not white, thus not eligible for citizenship per 1846 federal law, was the position of Texas.
The court dispensed with that argument by Texas when it ruled that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) — like all treaties — had the force of the Constitution and overruled any other law.
In the 1898 Wong Kim Ark case, the Supreme Court spoke decisively on the 14th Amendment. A California child born of Chinese immigrants whom law prevented from becoming citizens traveled to China. On returning to the United States, despite his birth in the United States, he was denied entry because his parents were Chinese. He was a “Chinese person.”
The court took great pains to elaborate on the history of citizenship in Great Britain, of British Common Law on the subject and what laws were in effect when the United States came into being.
It detailed dozens of Supreme Court decisions since 1804 that examined citizenship, concluding that, even before the 14th Amendment, children born in the United States were citizens unless they were born to foreign diplomats, American tribal Indians, on foreign ships in American waters or to women accompanying invading military forces.
The huge exception, of course, was the 1857 Dred Scott decision that ruled that Africans could not be citizens because they were either property or were not white, period. That issue was addressed by the Civil War and was overturned by Americans wearing blue uniforms.
The 14th Amendment was written in blood.
To the argument that it applied only to slaves and their children, evidence abounds that the Senate considered foreigners and many quotes exist in the congressional publication of the day that refers to “the strangers among us, Gypsies and Chinese.” Nonetheless, some argue that only black Americans were covered by the 14th Amendment.
Of course, the 14th’s wording alone destroys that argument: “ALL PERSONS BORN OR NATURALIZED in the United States.” “All” means all. Doesn’t it?
The 400 years of British and American court decisions, the laws and the Constitution mean nothing to those who question whether the 14th applies to almost all children born here. They would garner more support if they applied their faulty thinking to children of felons, murderers and traitors like spies Aldrich Ames and the Walker Family who sold out our nation to Russia.
They see mostly Mexicans; some see Central Americans. They have concocted “anchor babies,” a term that defines American-born children of illegal aliens as something other than a citizen as defined by the Constitution.
“Anchor babies” is the 21st Century version of the 18th Century British and American “n-word.”
The words themselves are blatant proof that those who use the term “anchor babies” are racists. You see, “anchor babies” are not defined in law or in the Constitution; they simply exist in the minds of people who hate Mexicans (and Central Americans) and need something to equate to their despicable, racist term for those of African descent.

Daily Caller,"OutletName host Tucker Carlson asked Democratic political commentator Jonathan Harris to describe the difference between an “immoral and a moral physical barrier on our border.”
Harris quickly managed to paint himself into a corner as he attempted to justify Democratic leadership’s refusal to give President Trump money to fund a border barrier.
“There’s a difference between a physical barrier — most of which is already in place — and a concrete wall which Trump wants,” Harris said as the two began discussing the issue.
“What is the difference between what they have voted for and what [Trump is] proposing?” Carlson asked.
“I think it hinges less upon what is there and more about the $5 billion he wants to build something else,” Harris responded. “They have already voted in support of fencing there. Trump actually criticized it.”
Harris quoted a OutletName report saying the wall would only stop a third of illegal immigration, then called funding it “a waste of money.” “So Democrats are budget hawks now?” Tucker asked, laughing.
Harris laughed, then mentioned the balanced budget under Clinton before saying that they are “kind of,” but “they just don’t talk about it.”
“Democrats are saying his proposal is immoral,” Tucker pressed. “Their proposal is moral. What’s the difference between an immoral and a moral physical barrier on our border?”
“Because one doesn’t cost $5 billion,” Harris responded.
“So it’s the cost that is immoral,” said Carlson. “So any time we spend $5 billion needlessly, we’re committing an immoral act?”
“It’s not about committing an immoral act,” said Harris. “This is about spending $5 billion to build a wall, that is ineffective to address the illegal immigration that does not come from our southern border but comes from legal ports of entry.”
Carlson pointed out the hypocrisy of Harris’ view by citing a parallel example of whether or not Harris would be “willing to shut down the government” over “$5 billion we spent on something that would not help the country.”
“That would be problematic,” said Harris. “I’m not president. Trump is president and he shut down the government.”
“So the cost, the nature of the barrier, those are not relevant to anything,” noted the OutletName host. “What we’re talking about is the fear what Trump is proposing might actually work. That’s the actual problem.”","outletname host tucker carlson asked democratic political commentator jonathan harris to describe the difference between an “ immoral and a moral physical barrier on our border. ” harris quickly managed to paint himself into a corner as he attempted to justify democratic leadership ’ s refusal to give president trump money to fund a border barrier. “ there ’ s a difference between a physical barrier — most of which is already in place — and a concrete wall which trump wants, ” harris said as the two began discussing the issue. “ what is the difference between what they have voted for and what [ trump is ] proposing? ” carlson asked. “ i think it hinges less upon what is there and more about the $ 5 billion he wants to build something else, ” harris responded. “ they have already voted in support of fencing there. trump actually criticized it. ” harris quoted a outletname report saying the wall would only stop a third of illegal immigration, then called funding it “ a waste of money. ” “ so democrats are budget hawks now? ” tucker asked, laughing. harris laughed, then mentioned the balanced budget under clinton before saying that they are “ kind of, ” but “ they just don ’ t talk about it. ” “ democrats are saying his proposal is immoral, ” tucker pressed. “ their proposal is moral. what ’ s the difference between an immoral and a moral physical barrier on our border? ” “ because one doesn ’ t cost $ 5 billion, ” harris responded. “ so it ’ s the cost that is immoral, ” said carlson. “ so any time we spend $ 5 billion needlessly, we ’ re committing an immoral act? ” “ it ’ s not about committing an immoral act, ” said harris. “ this is about spending $ 5 billion to build a wall, that is ineffective to address the illegal immigration that does not come from our southern border but comes from legal ports of entry. ” carlson pointed out the hypocrisy of harris ’ view by citing a parallel example of whether or not harris would be “ willing to shut down the government ” over “ $ 5 billion we spent on something that would not help the country. ” “ that would be problematic, ” said harris. “ i ’ m not president. trump is president and he shut down the government. ” “ so the cost, the nature of the barrier, those are not relevant to anything, ” noted the outletname host. “ what we ’ re talking about is the fear what trump is proposing might actually work. that",2.32074617088e-05,0.499976754188537,0,390,3.33,3.59,4.87,2.05,0.51,2.31,10.26,0.77,1.03,1.54,2.05,0.51,4.36,0.51,0.26,0.26,0.0,0.0,16.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.79,0.0,0.0,0.77,3.08,0.0,0.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.46,0.51,7.69,0.26,0.0,0.0,2.56,4.62,5.64,1.79,6.41025641025641,11.794871794871794,2.564102564102564

As the Senate comes back Wednesday and the House is set to follow next week, lawmakers are returning to their unfinished business that was punted at the end of last year -- including a potential deal on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy.
Sources familiar with ongoing talks say there were no substantial developments over recess, although senators working on negotiations did keep talking and several groups in the House left town with all-but-completed outlines that they opted to wait on rather than leave open to public attack over the break.
But even as negotiations have been making progress, lawmakers have felt President Donald Trump's personal buy-in has remained elusive and, yet, the key to any ultimate deal.
The meeting Wednesday is designed to discuss a deal on budget caps on domestic and military spending with the White House legislative chief and director of the Office of Management and Budget.

NYTimes,"When the hotel chain Motel 6 acknowledged in September that two of its Arizona motels had helped the government detain and deport some guests, the company said that the practice had been “implemented at the local level.” But a lawsuit filed on Wednesday by Washington State suggests that it may have been more widespread. The suit, filed in King County Superior Court in Seattle, alleges that hotel employees in that state routinely gave immigration agents personal information about guests, including their names, birth dates and license plate numbers. At least 9,000 names were turned over, according to the suit, though only six were known to have been detained. Washington’s attorney general, Robert W. Ferguson, said that he began an inquiry after reading reports about the activity in Arizona, which prompted widespread condemnation and calls to boycott the hotel chain. One of those articles quoted an immigration lawyer who said he had heard about the same thing happening in Washington. “Motel 6 implied this was a local problem,” Mr. Ferguson said in a statement. “We have found that is not true. Washingtonians have a right to privacy, and protection from discrimination. I will hold Motel 6 accountable and uncover the whole story of their disturbing conduct.” As part of Mr. Ferguson’s investigation, Motel 6 initially provided information about 11 of its 26 locations in Washington, six of which, the company said, had been assisting immigration agents. As the inquiry continues, the number of names turned over, and people detained as a result, will most likely go up, Mr. Ferguson said. So far, his office has requested information about two years of hotel practices through September, when the company, after the reports from Arizona, introduced a nationwide policy barring employees from providing guest names to law enforcement unless they were compelled to. “To help ensure that this does not occur again, we will be issuing a directive to every one of our more than 1,400 locations nationwide, making clear that they are prohibited from voluntarily providing daily guest lists” to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Raiza Rehkoff, a spokeswoman for G6 Hospitality, the Texas-based parent company of Motel 6, said at the time. In response to questions about the lawsuit in Washington, Jillian Perera, a spokeswoman for G6, reiterated that employees nationwide had been forbidden in September from engaging in the practice. “Motel 6 takes this matter very seriously,” she added, “and we have and will continue to fully cooperate with the office of the state attorney general.” Mr. Ferguson said that his staff had interviewed Motel 6 employees, who described how the information was provided to ICE agents. The lawsuit says that an ICE agent would come to the reception desk and request the guest list, sometimes daily. The receptionist would print out the list and give it to the agent, along with a “law enforcement acknowledgment form” for the agent to sign, confirming receipt of the information. “Motel 6 staff observed ICE identify guests of interest to ICE, including by circling guests with Latino-sounding names,” the lawsuit said. The suit asserts that in cooperating with ICE, Motel 6 employees violated state and federal laws that protect consumers and those that guard against discrimination, as well as the State Constitution. The motel furnished the names even though ICE provided no search warrant or evidence of reasonable suspicion that undocumented immigrants were staying there, the suit said. ICE, which is not a defendant in the lawsuit, said that it would not comment on the case. But Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe, a spokeswoman, said in an email that, in general, “immigration enforcement actions are targeted and lead-driven, prioritizing individuals who pose a risk to our communities.” “It’s worth noting that hotels and motels have frequently been exploited by criminal organizations engaged in highly dangerous illegal enterprises, including human trafficking and human smuggling,” she said.","when the hotel chain motel 6 acknowledged in september that two of its arizona motels had helped the government detain and deport some guests, the company said that the practice had been “ implemented at the local level. ” but a lawsuit filed on wednesday by washington state suggests that it may have been more widespread. the suit, filed in king county superior court in seattle, alleges that hotel employees in that state routinely gave immigration agents personal information about guests, including their names, birth dates and license plate numbers. at least 9, 000 names were turned over, according to the suit, though only six were known to have been detained. washington ’ s attorney general, robert w. ferguson, said that he began an inquiry after reading reports about the activity in arizona, which prompted widespread condemnation and calls to boycott the hotel chain. one of those articles quoted an immigration lawyer who said he had heard about the same thing happening in washington. “ motel 6 implied this was a local problem, ” mr. ferguson said in a statement. “ we have found that is not true. washingtonians have a right to privacy, and protection from discrimination. i will hold motel 6 accountable and uncover the whole story of their disturbing conduct. ” as part of mr. ferguson ’ s investigation, motel 6 initially provided information about 11 of its 26 locations in washington, six of which, the company said, had been assisting immigration agents. as the inquiry continues, the number of names turned over, and people detained as a result, will most likely go up, mr. ferguson said. so far, his office has requested information about two years of hotel practices through september, when the company, after the reports from arizona, introduced a nationwide policy barring employees from providing guest names to law enforcement unless they were compelled to. “ to help ensure that this does not occur again, we will be issuing a directive to every one of our more than 1, 400 locations nationwide, making clear that they are prohibited from voluntarily providing daily guest lists ” to immigration and customs enforcement, raiza rehkoff, a spokeswoman for g6 hospitality, the texas - based parent company of motel 6, said at the time. in response to questions about the lawsuit in washington, jillian perera, a spokeswoman for g6, reiterated that employees nationwide had been forbidden in september from engaging in the practice. “ motel 6 takes this matter very seriously, ” she added, “ and we have and will continue to fully cooperate with the office of the state attorney general. ” mr",0.999981164932251,0.499981222632414,1,421,4.75,4.51,7.6,1.9,0.71,4.99,8.31,2.38,1.43,0.0,0.95,0.48,2.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.39,0.24,0.95,0.71,1.9,0.0,0.0,4.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,6.41,0.71,5.46,0.0,0.24,0.0,4.04,7.84,1.43,1.19,4.275534441805226,10.688836104513063,0.23752969121140144
NYTimes,"President Trump hit back on Friday at criticism over his administration’s hard-line stance on immigration, lamenting the “death and destruction caused by people that shouldn’t be here,” and accusing Democrats and the news media of not caring. While statistics show that native-born Americans commit crimes at higher rates than immigrants, Mr. Trump has long pushed a narrative that suggests otherwise. “No major networks send cameras to their homes or display the images of their incredible loved ones,” Mr. Trump said about the people who stood behind him on Friday — family members of those killed by undocumented immigrants. “These are the stories that Democrats and people that are weak on immigration” do not want to hear, he added. Mr. Trump’s somberly delivered remarks came two days after he signed an executive order to end the separation of families at the border, and amid a fiercely emotional national debate over the fate of some 2,300 children — many of them toddlers and infants — who have already been separated from their parents while trying to enter the United States. The president said that what the people who stood behind him, known as “angel families,” had been through was worse. Mr. Trump has embraced the stories of Americans killed by undocumented immigrants since the early days of his presidential campaign, giving them a platform to describe their tragedies at the Republican convention. He also honored several of them during his first address to Congress. On Friday, he gave them a platform at the White House, inviting the family members to deliver a personal story about their relatives, and deliver details of the deaths of their children. Some died in car accidents. Others were raped, beaten or tortured before they were killed. “I’m one of your legal immigrants,” said Sabine Durden, whose son, Dominic, was killed in a vehicular accident. Mr. Trump introduced her by saying her story was an “incredible” one. “I didn’t drag him over borders through deserts,” Ms. Durden said, at one point holding up a container of her son’s ashes. “I didn’t place him in harm’s way.” Several of the family members, holding large photos of their loved ones, said they shared the president’s anger with the news media. “I wish some of our media had the same integrity as our president,” Steve Ronnebeck, whose 21-year-old son, Grant, was shot by a man over a pack of cigarettes. The parents were emotional and raw as they delivered stories of personal tragedies delivered at the hands of immigrants who had entered the United States illegally. Their concerns about illegal immigration, and the crime statistics that the president pointed to, are echoed by many Americans. “Americans have long believed that immigrants are more likely than natives to commit crimes and that rising immigration leads to rising crime,” the National Academy of Sciences wrote in a 2015 study. “This belief is remarkably resilient to the contrary evidence that immigrants are in fact much less likely than natives to commit crimes. According to a 2017 report from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, 1.53 percent of native-born Americans are incarcerated, compared with 0.85 percent of undocumented immigrants and 0.47 percent of legal immigrants. The Marshall Project, in a 2018 analysis of data from 200 metropolitan areas over the last few decades, found that crime has fallen despite the immigrant population increasing. Other studies have found that the immigration has little effect on crime. Inviting the families to speak to the public was another strategy for the president, who has railed against undocumented immigrants since his days on the campaign trail and whose rhetoric about them has intensified in recent days. He has branded many illegal immigrants as “murderers and thieves” who want to “infest our country.” For Mr. Trump, the stories fit perfectly into his dark message about the threats coming over the border, which whipped up his supporters at rallies and helped motivate his voters at the polls. Stories from the victims’ families put a human face on Mr. Trump’s demand for a sprawling wall along the southern border. His relationship with the families dates back to his time as a candidate. In his campaign announcement in summer 2015, Mr. Trump assailed immigrants from Mexico, saying: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.” The speech was noticed by several mothers and fathers whose children were the victims of brutal crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, some of whom had been deported several times, only to return. As he battled Hillary Clinton for the White House, Mr. Trump kept in touch with many of the families by phone. And after he won the election, the president invited three of the family members to sit with Melania Trump, the first lady, during his first address to Congress. This week, the president told his supporters at a rally in Duluth, Minn., that angel families were not of interest to the news media or to Democrats. “They don’t bring cameras to interview the angel moms whose children were killed by criminal aliens who should have never been here in the first place,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday. “Not even close. They don’t want to talk to the angel moms.” It was sentiment shared at the White House on Friday by Laura Wilkerson, whose 18-year-old son, Josh, died in 2010 after being tortured and beaten. “It’s sad for our country,” Ms. Wilkerson said. “And it’s time to take it back.”","president trump hit back on friday at criticism over his administration ’ s hard - line stance on immigration, lamenting the “ death and destruction caused by people that shouldn ’ t be here, ” and accusing democrats and the news media of not caring. while statistics show that native - born americans commit crimes at higher rates than immigrants, mr. trump has long pushed a narrative that suggests otherwise. “ no major networks send cameras to their homes or display the images of their incredible loved ones, ” mr. trump said about the people who stood behind him on friday — family members of those killed by undocumented immigrants. “ these are the stories that democrats and people that are weak on immigration ” don't want to hear, he added. mr. trump ’ s somberly delivered remarks came two days after he signed an executive order to end the separation of families at the border, and amid a fiercely emotional national debate over the fate of some 2, 300 children — many of them toddlers and infants — who have already been separated from their parents while trying to enter the united states. the president said that what the people who stood behind him, known as “ angel families, ” had been through was worse. mr. trump has embraced the stories of americans killed by undocumented immigrants since the early days of his presidential campaign, giving them a platform to describe their tragedies at the republican convention. he also honored several of them during his first address to congress. on friday, he gave them a platform at the white house, inviting the family members to deliver a personal story about their relatives, and deliver details of the deaths of their children. some died in car accidents. others were raped, beaten or tortured before they were killed. “ i ’ m one of your legal immigrants, ” said sabine durden, whose son, dominic, was killed in a vehicular accident. mr. trump introduced her by saying her story was an “ incredible ” one. “ i didn ’ t drag him over borders through deserts, ” ms. durden said, at one point holding up a container of her son ’ s ashes. “ i didn ’ t place him in harm ’ s way. ” several of the family members, holding large photos of their loved ones, said they shared the president ’ s anger with the news media. “ i wish some of our media had the same integrity as our president, ” steve ronnebeck, whose 21 - year - old son, grant, was shot by a man over a pack of cigarettes. the parents",0.999983787536621,0.499983764275385,1,411,1.95,4.38,9.73,4.62,0.49,4.62,4.38,0.24,0.49,0.73,0.49,0.0,2.19,0.49,1.22,0.0,0.49,0.24,24.82,3.89,0.0,0.97,4.87,0.0,0.49,0.73,0.0,0.24,2.43,0.49,0.0,0.24,0.0,1.7,0.0,0.24,8.76,0.97,6.33,0.97,0.24,0.24,4.14,7.54,1.46,0.49,6.310679611650485,9.951456310679612,1.9417475728155338
HuffPost,"Never has the state of immigration been more in flux. Every category it seems has come under fire -- whether it’s family-based immigration, which has been dubbed ‘chain migration,’ employment-based under the guise of ‘Buy American Hire American’ or the diversity lottery which has been deemed a “national security” threat.
But of all the immigration issues currently up for debate, none is more urgent than the one facing Dreamers – those over 800,000 young people whose status in the US has become a cruel game of chess between the president and Congress that is being played right now.
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, (DACA) established under President Obama, opened a whole new path for young people who were brought to this country as children and raised essentially as Americans. DACA has allowed many of them to obtain a college education and many for the first time to legitimately pursue a career.
Last year, the Trump Administration announced it was cancelling the program, setting it on a course to end on March 5, 2018 unless Congress could find a fix. The best option, the Dream Act, which in the past has gotten strong bipartisan support and is favored by a majority of Americans, would extend legal permanent residency to Dreamers. But with ever more unreasonable demands from President Trump in exchange for his support, such as $18 billion for a border wall, it seems increasingly unlikely the sides could reach a sensible compromise.
Yet, those of us who know these remarkable young people, and who understand their stories, those of us who are their advocates and their teachers, their employers, their co-workers and friends -- continue to look to this fractured Congress for a reprieve.
Immigration attorneys like myself have seen the fallout of Donald Trump’s actions. Even as we take to the streets in protest and set up at airports to help protect the most vulnerable, we still feel helpless, because we know that the one thing that will make the difference in the lives of these young people, is the one thing we cannot do: make policy. So we are left to clean up the damage.
But what if we could be proactive, and begin now by creating a plan of action to help DREAMers in the event Congress does not pass a Dream Act and before it is too late?
My vision is for a nationwide legal defense fund for immigrants. It draws on my experience as a former barrister in the U.K., where I practiced about 13 years ago. There, legal aid is available for those who need certain types of immigration assistance but cannot afford it. US Immigration is tricky and complicated and studies show that with legal representation, people have significantly higher chances of success in court.
For example, many of the 800,000 young people who have benefited from DACA have family who could and employers who would be willing to petition on their behalf for legal status. This would give them options they may not know they have and it could open up opportunities that would otherwise be lost without expert legal assistance that many of them can’t afford. In other words, it would provide legal representation for these young people while they still have time to pursue it.
There’s precedence for this in the US, too. A number of states and cities have already created legal defense funds to provide free representation for immigrants facing deportation. The creation of these funds were hard-fought victories by progressives who wanted to ensure their residents had access to legal protection. New York and California took the lead and I’m proud of city leaders in Seattle who worked to create a fund for residents here as well.
Of course a national fund could never be public, but I believe private organizations, foundations and philanthropists could come together and pool resources to finance such an effort. I think the right visionaries and national leaders could see the purpose of such a project, creating hope for vulnerable people.
Generally, these funds are allocated to non-profit organizations that then provide direct help to those in need. Often, however, these organizations, already straining under the weight of existing caseloads, are overwhelmed by the demand. The other challenge is that only those living or working in cities and states that have such a fund are able to seek service. In my opinion, a national plan could be broader in scope and able to help those facing deportation anywhere in the country, with priority given to DREAMers, should DACA end without a viable alternatives in place.
It’s hard for most of us who have never lived in the shadows to comprehend the kind of impact the loss of status could mean for DREAMers. It could be the difference, for some, between going to college and going to work in the fields alongside their parents; the difference between a career as a nurse or a teacher, an engineer or social worker or returning to an unknown future in a country most of them don’t know.","never has the state of immigration been more in flux. every category it seems has come under fire - - whether it ’ s family - based immigration, which has been dubbed ‘ chain migration, ’ employment - based under the guise of ‘ buy american hire american ’ or the diversity lottery which has been deemed a “ national security ” threat. but of all the immigration issues currently up for debate, none is more urgent than the one facing dreamers – those over 800, 000 young people whose status in the us has become a cruel game of chess between the president and congress that is being played right now. deferred action for childhood arrivals, ( daca ) established under president obama, opened a whole new path for young people who were brought to this country as children and raised essentially as americans. daca has allowed many of them to obtain a college education and many for the first time to legitimately pursue a career. last year, the trump administration announced it was cancelling the program, setting it on a course to end on march 5, 2018 unless congress could find a fix. the best option, the dream act, which in the past has gotten strong bipartisan support and is favored by a majority of americans, would extend legal permanent residency to dreamers. but with ever more unreasonable demands from president trump in exchange for his support, such as $ 18 billion for a border wall, it seems increasingly unlikely the sides could reach a sensible compromise. yet, those of us who know these remarkable young people, and who understand their stories, those of us who are their advocates and their teachers, their employers, their co - workers and friends - - continue to look to this fractured congress for a reprieve. immigration attorneys like myself have seen the fallout of donald trump ’ s actions. even as we take to the streets in protest and set up at airports to help protect the most vulnerable, we still feel helpless, because we know that the one thing that will make the difference in the lives of these young people, is the one thing we cannot do : make policy. so we are left to clean up the damage. but what if we could be proactive, and begin now by creating a plan of action to help dreamers in the event congress does not pass a dream act and before it is too late? my vision is for a nationwide legal defense fund for immigrants. it draws on my experience as a former barrister in the u. k., where i practiced about 13 years ago. there, legal aid is available for those who need",0.999980926513671,0.499980910846716,1,435,1.84,3.68,8.28,2.76,0.92,4.6,8.97,1.84,1.38,1.61,1.38,0.0,3.91,0.0,0.46,0.0,0.23,0.0,12.18,0.23,0.23,0.0,0.23,0.69,0.23,3.45,0.69,0.0,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23,0.92,9.2,2.07,6.44,0.69,0.0,0.23,5.98,3.22,5.98,0.46,5.517241379310345,9.655172413793103,1.3793103448275863
Breitbart,"A liberal panelist at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Friday was booed down after claiming that “Mexicans who are coming across this border” are politically aligned with conservatives.
During the panel “The Trump Effect on American Politics,” left-wing radio host Rick Ungar attempted to justify illegal immigration, a weak U.S.-Mexico border, and amnesty for illegal aliens by saying Mexican illegal aliens held conservative viewpoints.
Ungar said:
Everybody always say Democrats want to do [amnesty] because we see millions of new voters coming to the Democratic Party, and I’ve got to tell you something, as somebody who lived in Mexico for seven years of my life, Mexicans who are coming across this border have so much more in common with conservatives that it’s not even a close call. They do. They do. [Emphasis added]
The CPAC panelist was quickly booed down by conservatives in the audience, who eventually started chanting “Build that wall!” the famous phrase often chanted at President Trump’s campaign rallies.
For the last few years, CPAC organizers have shunned pro-American immigration reformers from the conservative conference, despite polls showing that Republican voters see reducing illegal and legal immigration levels as the second biggest priority for the nation.
Instead, CPAC’s 2018 immigration panel included four men, three of which have ties and funding connections to the pro-mass immigration billionaires, the Koch brothers.

Ungar’s assertion that the massive waves of legal and illegal immigration over the past three to four decades, primarily from Central America, is turning out new Republican and conservative voters runs contrary to research by University of Maryland, College Park researcher James Gimpel.
In 2014, Gimpel’s research concluded with three major findings:
Immigrants, particularly Hispanics and Asians, have policy preferences when it comes to the size and scope of government that are more closely aligned with progressives than with conservatives. As a result, survey data show a two-to-one party identification with Democrats over Republicans.
By increasing income inequality and adding to the low-income population (e.g. immigrants and their minor children account for one-fourth of those in poverty and one-third of the uninsured) immigration likely makes all voters more supportive of redistributive policies championed by Democrats to support disadvantaged populations.
There is evidence that immigration may cause more Republican-oriented voters to move away from areas of high immigrant settlement leaving behind a more lopsided Democrat majority.
Democrats like former San Antonio, Texas mayor Julian Castro admit that mass immigration to the U.S. will result in Democrat dominance for generations in swing states.

As OutletName News reported, should current legal immigration levels remain the same for the next 20 years — wherein the U.S. admits more than one million legal immigrants a year — there will be about 15 million new foreign-born voters added to the U.S. electorate, more than enough to swing elections in favor for one political party over the other.
Every year, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from the process known as “chain migration,” whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.","a liberal panelist at the conservative political action conference ( cpac ) on friday was booed down after claiming that “ mexicans who are coming across this border ” are politically aligned with conservatives. during the panel “ the trump effect on american politics, ” left - wing radio host rick ungar attempted to justify illegal immigration, a weak u. s. - mexico border, and amnesty for illegal aliens by saying mexican illegal aliens held conservative viewpoints. ungar said : everybody always say democrats want to do [ amnesty ] because we see millions of new voters coming to the democratic party, and i ’ ve got to tell you something, as somebody who lived in mexico for seven years of my life, mexicans who are coming across this border have so much more in common with conservatives that it ’ s not even a close call. they do. they do.

NYTimes,"As negotiators on Capitol Hill held out hope of a swift agreement that could end the impasse before the weekend was out, the House and the Senate were reconvening for a rare Saturday session. The likeliest path to reopening the government was an agreement on a stopgap spending measure that stretched longer than the few days that Senate Democrats wanted, but shorter than the four weeks that the House approved on Thursday night.
But agreeing on the length of the stopgap bill was complicated by several contentious issues, particularly the fate of the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants known as Dreamers.
Mr. Trump said Democrats were prioritizing “illegal immigrants” over American citizens and military personnel, and argued that the only solution to end the dysfunction was to defeat the party in this year’s midterm congressional elections.
“Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border,” the president said. “They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!”
In fact, it was Mr. Trump who opted not to accept a deal that he and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, had hashed out over lunch at the White House on Friday, which would have kept the government open, funded a border wall and extended legal status to undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, later called Mr. Schumer to say the agreement lacked sufficient immigration restrictions.
While Mr. Schumer said shortly after the government shut down that “in my heart, I thought we might have a deal tonight,” White House officials argued that he had drastically overstated the progress made during the lunch.
In the absence of a resolution, Republicans and Democrats traded political recriminations.
“What a massive failure of leadership,” Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement. “Donald Trump, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell and Republican lawmakers pulled out all the stops to give a massive tax break to their wealthy donors, but now that it’s time to take care of the rest of America they can’t get their act together.”
“This is Trump’s Republican Party: chaotic, destructive and driven by greed,” he added.
The president’s Twitter burst came on a morning when he had planned to be in Palm Beach, most likely preparing for a round of golf and the Saturday night party at Mar-a-Lago, which guests have paid $100,000 per couple to attend. Instead, his schedule was blank, containing no indication that the president was headed south to warmer temperatures or celebratory events.
Still, Mr. Trump was impatient to complete an agreement to reopen the government — whatever the details might be — and depart for his resort, advisers said.
Traveling to the Middle East, Vice President Mike Pence sought to reassure American service members that the shutdown would be resolved, telling them, “We’ll get this thing figured out in Washington.” But he told reporters traveling with him, “It’s going to take as long as it takes.”
While the administration has argued that it is doing more than President Barack Obama’s did in 2013 to soften the effect of a shutdown, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence both emphasized that active-duty military personnel would be serving without pay until the government resumes its normal functions.
“These soldiers deserve better,” Mr. Pence said at Shannon Airport in Ireland, where Air Force Two was refueling as he made his way to Cairo for the start of a three-day visit to the Middle East.
“You have troops headed down range to Kuwait for six months, and they are anxious about the fact that they aren’t going to get paid right away,” he added, calling the situation “unconscionable.”
“It’s disappointing to every American that Democrats in the Senate would shut down the government when we have troops in harm’s way,” Mr. Pence said.
Democrats tried early Saturday to win passage of emergency legislation to ensure that military personnel received pay during the shutdown, but Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, objected. He said he wanted to reach an agreement to fund the entire government “before this becomes necessary.”
In a statement Friday night, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said immigration talks could reopen only “when Democrats start paying our armed forces and first responders.”
“We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands,” she added.","as negotiators on capitol hill held out hope of a swift agreement that could end the impasse before the weekend was out, the house and the senate were reconvening for a rare saturday session. the likeliest path to reopening the government was an agreement on a stopgap spending measure that stretched longer than the few days that senate democrats wanted, but shorter than the four weeks that the house approved on thursday night. but agreeing on the length of the stopgap bill was complicated by several contentious issues, particularly the fate of the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants known as dreamers. mr. trump said democrats were prioritizing “ illegal immigrants ” over american citizens and military personnel, and argued that the only solution to end the dysfunction was to defeat the party in this year ’ s midterm congressional elections. “ democrats are far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border, ” the president said. “ they could have easily made a deal but decided to play shutdown politics instead. # weneedmorerepublicansin18 in order to power through mess! ” in fact, it was mr. trump who opted not to accept a deal that he and senator chuck schumer of new york, the top senate democrat, had hashed out over lunch at the white house on friday, which would have kept the government open, funded a border wall and extended legal status to undocumented immigrants brought to the united states as children. john f. kelly, the white house chief of staff, later called mr. schumer to say the agreement lacked sufficient immigration restrictions. while mr. schumer said shortly after the government shut down that “ in my heart, i thought we might have a deal tonight, ” white house officials argued that he had drastically overstated the progress made during the lunch. in the absence of a resolution, republicans and democrats traded political recriminations. “ what a massive failure of leadership, ” tom perez, the chairman of the democratic national committee, said in a statement. “ donald trump, paul ryan, mitch mcconnell and republican lawmakers pulled out all the stops to give a massive tax break to their wealthy donors, but now that it ’ s time to take care of the rest of america they can ’ t get their act together. ” “ this is trump ’ s republican party : chaotic, destructive and driven by greed, ” he added. the president ’ s twitter burst came on a morning when he",0.999984979629516,0.499984984107869,1,405,0.99,4.44,9.88,1.48,0.74,7.41,7.41,1.23,0.49,1.73,0.99,0.0,2.96,0.25,0.49,0.0,0.49,0.0,11.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.98,0.99,1.23,3.46,1.48,0.0,0.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.49,7.65,0.74,6.17,0.74,0.0,0.0,6.91,7.41,1.48,0.74,5.185185185185185,12.592592592592592,0.9876543209876543
Breitbart,"The Brooks County Sheriff’s Office reported the recovery of three deceased migrants this week. The discoveries raised the migrant death toll for this county located about 80 miles inland from the Mexican border to five for 2019.
On February 17, Brooks County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Bianca Mora received information about the discovery of a deceased migrant in the southwest part of the county, according to information provided by sheriff’s office officials. This is a known area for drug smugglers to drop off their human cargo to have them march around the Falfurrias Border Patrol Checkpoint.
Deputy Mora met Border Patrol agents and a justice of the peace at the scene four miles into the ranch where she observed a deceased male lying face down in a wooded area. She reported that the partially disrobed migrant wore a purple plaid shirt, grey boxers, blue jeans with a khaki belt, and black socks. Shoes were found near the body along with a cellphone, a charger, a yellow wallet containing a Mexican identification card, a silver chain with a round pendant, eyeglasses, a wristwatch, and a prescription pill container.
The justice of the peace made the statutory death pronouncement and the local funeral home representatives took custody of the body.
Mora noted the identification card belonged to 57-year-old Daniel Quintero Ochoa. It is not known if that is the identity of the deceased migrant and the face had decomposed beyond recognition from being face-down in the dirt.
The Webb County Medical Examiner’s Office in Laredo, Texas, will provide autopsy services for Brooks County and will attempt to confirm the deceased’s identity.
Three days earlier, Deputy S. Rosas and Training Officer B. Gomez received information about the discovery of skeletal remains on a ranch located near the Border Patrol checkpoint. The deputies met Border Patrol agents at the scene located about 1.2 miles into the ranch, sheriff’s officials reported. The deputies found skeletal remains scattered by animals over a wide area. Deputies found a small quantity of foreign currency at the scene.
Deputy Rosas gathered the skeletal remains and personal items and placed them in paper evidence bags. The remains will be transported to the Webb County Medical Examiner’s office who will attempt to make an identification from the remains.
On February 11, Deputy Robert Castanon received notice of the discovery of the skeletal remains of a third deceased migrant. These remains were located on the same ranch as the February 14 discovery. Castanon met a Border Patrol agent at the scene located about 4.5 miles inside the ranch.
The agent led the deputy to the location of what appears to be a female migrant based upon items of clothing found at the scene. The bones and skull were found in a wide area after being scattered by animals. In addition to the skeletal remains, the deputy found a woman’s silver ring with a pink stone, a white bra, a small blue bag made from cloth, and an assortment of change, the report states.
The deputy gathered the remains and personal effects of the deceased migrant and placed them in evidence bags for transportation to the Webb County Medical Examiner’s Office who will attempt to identify the deceased.
The discovery of the three sets of human remains brings the migrant death toll for this year in this single county located about 80 miles from the Texas border with Mexico to five.
Border Patrol officials also found the body of a migrant who drowned in the All-American Canal in Southern California this week, OutletName News reported on Thursday.
The International Organization for Migrants’ Missing Migrant Project reports that at least 21 migrants have been found dead in incidents connected to smuggling migrants across the border into the U.S.– 18 of those were found near the Texas border.

HuffPost,"President Donald Trump wants a border wall so badly that he’s willing to sustain what on Saturday became the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history.
But for all his bluster, Trump has not racked up the draconian immigration enforcement record he threatened from the campaign trail. By the most important enforcement metric, deportations, Trump has trailed far behind his more liberal predecessor Barack Obama.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported about 95,000 people from the interior of the United States last year. Interior deportations in Obama’s first three years in office topped 200,000 annually. Only in his final two years in office did Obama register numbers lower than Trump’s.
Trump’s comparatively low deportation numbers are no coincidence: They are a direct result of the administration’s chaotic attempts to overhaul the immigration system. Each ill-planned and legally dubious move the Trump administration makes to change the enforcement system clogs up some part of the federal bureaucracy and makes it harder for the administration to achieve its stated goals.
The Self-Defeating Quest For The Wall
Trump’s fixation on the wall ― or fence, or steel slats, or “peaches,” or whatever he’s calling it this week ― is a great example of how his policies tend to kneecap immigration enforcement.
The federal government is responsible for enforcing immigration law, so no one truly obsessed with deporting people would allow the federal government to shut down because that would further jam up a complex enforcement system that is already backlogged in the federal courts by more than 1 million cases.That’s exactly what’s happening. The country’s immigration courts are largely closed. Those who miss their court dates because of the shutdown are getting sent to the back of the line, according to OutletName ― which can mean delays of up to four years. As of last week, nearly 43,000 hearings had been canceled, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse project at Syracuse University ― with an additional 20,000 or so cancellations expected for every week the shutdown drags on.
ICE is about to blow through its detention budget again, raising legal questions about whether the agency can continue to detain some of the people in its custody, according to BuzzFeed.
These are not the kinds of results one would expect with a hard-liner in the White House. But it’s a perfectly logical outcome for Trump, who campaigned on a border wall to solve a contrived crisis of illegal immigration at a time when unauthorized crossings stood at 45-year lows.
Terrifying Migrant Communities, But Making Deportations Harder
Trump’s other actions have undermined enforcement, too. Within a week of taking office, he signed a sweeping executive order that, among other things, did away with Obama-era prosecutorial discretion guidelines that had directed ICE to focus its arrests on people with serious criminal records, recent border-crossers or people with previous deportations on their records. The message, which Trump’s first acting director of ICE, Thomas Homan, repeated often, was clear: No one would be exempt from enforcement of federal law.It was terrifying for migrant communities, which now feared more indiscriminate enforcement. But it also undermined the goal of increasing deportations, because it’s a more complicated and longer process to remove someone from the country who has a clean criminal record and the right to a hearing before an immigration judge.
Moving Judges To The Border ― And Slowing Deportation Cases
Likewise, the Trump administration shuffled judges to the border in an attempt to rush through the cases of Central American families that have shown up in larger numbers in recent years, often requesting asylum ― effectively putting cases guaranteed to be lengthy at the front of the jam-packed docket. But the judges didn’t share then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ enthusiasm for disposing of asylum cases quickly and skeptically. And the backlog in their home jurisdictions grew, too.
Polarizing Politics And Pushing Liberal Jurisdictions To Protect Immigrants
On top of all this, the Trump administration’s hostility toward migrants and hyper-polarization of the immigration issue has made Democratic-led jurisdictions far more likely to embrace “sanctuary” policies limiting cooperation with ICE than they were under Obama. The consequence of Trump’s lack of diplomacy is that ICE now has far less leeway to make arrests at local jails than it once did, reducing the agency’s efficiency.
More Money, Fewer Results
So, now the president who entered office promising to deport up to 3 million people is actually removing far fewer people than the Democrat who preceded him ― even though ICE’s budget ballooned by more than 15 percent to $7.1 billion last year. And Trump’s fixation on securing partial funding for a wall is only making him more inefficient.
None of this should be particularly surprising. Trump has fabricated a vision of the border untethered from reality to sell his wall proposal. But it has become increasingly common, as the shutdown drags on, for Trump’s Republican backers in Congress to defend the president’s intransigence as a common-sense plea for a long overdue commitment to a more vaguely defined “border security.”
But there’s no unusual crisis at the border other than a high number of Central American families and children, who hardly present a security threat. And to judge from Trump’s record so far, he’s more committed to the idea of a wall, regardless of the cost, than to actual immigration enforcement.","president donald trump wants a border wall so badly that he ’ s willing to sustain what on saturday became the longest federal government shutdown in u. s. history. but for all his bluster, trump has not racked up the draconian immigration enforcement record he threatened from the campaign trail. by the most important enforcement metric, deportations, trump has trailed far behind his more liberal predecessor barack obama. immigration and customs enforcement deported about 95, 000 people from the interior of the united states last year. interior deportations in obama ’ s first three years in office topped 200, 000 annually. only in his final two years in office did obama register numbers lower than trump ’ s. trump ’ s comparatively low deportation numbers are no coincidence : they are a direct result of the administration ’ s chaotic attempts to overhaul the immigration system. each ill - planned and legally dubious move the trump administration makes to change the enforcement system clogs up some part of the federal bureaucracy and makes it harder for the administration to achieve its stated goals. the self - defeating quest for the wall trump ’ s fixation on the wall ― or fence, or steel slats, or “ peaches, ” or whatever he ’ s calling it this week ― is a great example of how his policies tend to kneecap immigration enforcement. the federal government is responsible for enforcing immigration law, so no one truly obsessed with deporting people would allow the federal government to shut down because that would further jam up a complex enforcement system that is already backlogged in the federal courts by more than 1 million cases. that ’ s exactly what ’ s happening. the country ’ s immigration courts are largely closed. those who miss their court dates because of the shutdown are getting sent to the back of the line, according to outletname ― which can mean delays of up to four years. as of last week, nearly 43, 000 hearings had been canceled, according to the transactional records access clearinghouse project at syracuse university ― with an additional 20, 000 or so cancellations expected for every week the shutdown drags on. ice is about to blow through its detention budget again, raising legal questions about whether the agency can continue to detain some of the people in its custody, according to buzzfeed. these are not the kinds of results one would expect with a hard - liner in the white house. but it ’ s a perfectly logical outcome for trump, who campaigned on a border wall to solve a contrived crisis of illegal immigration at a time when",0.99998128414154,0.499981246988682,1,425,3.53,6.82,6.35,0.0,1.18,5.18,11.06,1.88,2.59,1.41,2.12,0.71,3.76,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.65,0.0,0.24,2.59,0.47,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.47,10.12,0.47,8.71,0.24,0.0,0.24,4.94,2.59,4.0,1.65,4.235294117647059,10.823529411764705,0.7058823529411765
FoxNews,"Every new illegal immigrant that enters the United States will cost more than $82,000 each over their lifetime, a conservative think tank that advocates for lower immigration levels has claimed. The Center for Immigration Studies updated their 2012 analysis which put the average lifetime net fiscal cost of a border crosser at $74,722. In the six years since, the price has jumped to $82,191. The think tank’s analysis has come into question however, with multiple outlets pushing back on its numbers and methodology. The new figure by the CIS estimates what it takes to protect the border, educate, house and feed illegal immigrants and makes the assumption they will spend a lifetime on various welfare programs. This estimate means that for every 100,000 illegal immigrants that are stopped from crossing the border, it would save taxpayers $8.2 billion over the illegal immigrants’ lifetimes, the report states. The report also concludes that a southern border wall between the U.S. and Mexico would only have to stop four percent of undocumented migrants, or about 60,000 over the next 10 years, to recoup the cost of President Trump’s $5 billion funding ask. Almost everyone has come up with a different price tag on the cost of illegal immigration. President Trump, for example, has touted several different estimates. During a Cabinet meeting in late December, Trump put the price of illegal immigration as high as $275 billion. “I’ve heard numbers as high as $275 billion we lose on illegal immigrants,” he said. “The $5, $5.6 billion approve by the House is such a small amount compared to the level of the problem.” In early December, Trump said illegal immigration cost $250 billion per year. On Dec. 18, he said it was “more than $250 billion” per year. That number jumped dramatically two days later when he claimed, “illegal immigration cost our nation $275 billion a year.” Meg Wiehe, deputy director at the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told OutletName that Trump’s figure “sounds extraordinarily high to me.” David Dyssegaard Kallick, deputy director of the nonpartisan Fiscal Policy Institute, was more blunt, calling the numbers “frankly absurd.” CIS research director Steven Camarota says even though experts may disagree over his numbers, one thing is clear - a border wall with Mexico will eventually pay for itself by reducing taxpayer burdens. “The range of reasonable assumption indicated that a wall would not have to come close to being anywhere near 100 percent effective to pay for itself,” he wrote. “This would be true even if a wall cost twice as much. A wall that is only partially effective could pay for itself by offsetting the cost that otherwise successful illegal crossers would create. “","every new illegal immigrant that enters the united states will cost more than $ 82, 000 each over their lifetime, a conservative think tank that advocates for lower immigration levels has claimed. the center for immigration studies updated their 2012 analysis which put the average lifetime net fiscal cost of a border crosser at $ 74, 722. in the six years since, the price has jumped to $ 82, 191. the think tank ’ s analysis has come into question however, with multiple outlets pushing back on its numbers and methodology. the new figure by the cis estimates what it takes to protect the border, educate, house and feed illegal immigrants and makes the assumption they will spend a lifetime on various welfare programs. this estimate means that for every 100, 000 illegal immigrants that are stopped from crossing the border, it would save taxpayers $ 8. 2 billion over the illegal immigrants ’ lifetimes, the report states. the report also concludes that a southern border wall between the u. s. and mexico would only have to stop four percent of undocumented migrants, or about 60, 000 over the next 10 years, to recoup the cost of president trump ’ s $ 5 billion funding ask. almost everyone has come up with a different price tag on the cost of illegal immigration. president trump, for example, has touted several different estimates. during a cabinet meeting in late december, trump put the price of illegal immigration as high as $ 275 billion. “ i ’ ve heard numbers as high as $ 275 billion we lose on illegal immigrants, ” he said. “ the $ 5, $ 5. 6 billion approve by the house is such a small amount compared to the level of the problem. ” in early december, trump said illegal immigration cost $ 250 billion per year. on dec. 18, he said it was “ more than $ 250 billion ” per year. that number jumped dramatically two days later when he claimed, “ illegal immigration cost our nation $ 275 billion a year. ” meg wiehe, deputy director at the nonpartisan institute on taxation and economic policy, told outletname that trump ’ s figure “ sounds extraordinarily high to me. ” david dyssegaard kallick, deputy director of the nonpartisan fiscal policy institute, was more blunt, calling the numbers “ frankly absurd. ” cis research director steven camarota says even though experts may disagree over his numbers, one thing is clear - a border wall with mexico will eventually pay for itself by reducing taxpayer burdens. “ the range of reasonable assumption indicated",0.0004028618277516,0.499597132205963,0,404,8.91,12.13,3.71,0.5,0.5,2.97,8.66,2.97,0.74,0.5,2.23,0.25,2.48,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.99,0.0,0.5,2.72,3.96,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.99,9.65,2.23,6.68,0.5,0.5,0.0,6.19,2.48,3.22,1.73,7.920792079207921,8.663366336633663,0.7425742574257426
NYTimes,"Thank goodness that’s over.
On Monday the Senate voted 81 to 18 and the House 266 to 150 to reopen the federal government and fund it through Feb. 8, as well as to stop holding hostage the health care of almost nine million poor kids — and not a moment too soon. Shutdowns may make good partisan theater, but they don’t make any winners.
Now perhaps Congress will finally get around to taking up a bill to protect the nearly 700,000 so-called Dreamers, immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children — legislation that almost nine in 10 Americans support.
That, at least, was the offer the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, made in order to break the stalemate. It wasn’t an ironclad promise, of course, and given Mr. McConnell’s record, it’s fair of many Democrats and other people of good faith to question his word.
Nonetheless, the spotlight is now where it should be: on the failure of President Trump and Republicans in Congress to take care of the Dreamers, despite their repeated claims that they want to. Mr. Trump has sent wildly contradictory messages. The Dreamers, he said last February, are “absolutely incredible kids” who deserve to be treated “with heart.” And yet, in September he created this problem by ordering an end to the program if Congress didn’t find a permanent fix by March 5. Two weeks ago he promised to deliver them a “bill of love.” But two days later he rejected a bipartisan deal to that end. On Friday, hours before the shutdown deadline, Mr. Trump reportedly reached an agreement with the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, which would have protected Dreamers and increased border security, but he then reversed course at the urging of the anti-immigrant hawks who circle the Oval Office — mainly his chief of staff, John Kelly, and senior adviser, Stephen Miller. On Sunday, the president unleashed his inner Mr. Miller and attacked Democrats who, he said, “just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked.” So what does this White House want? No one seems to know, including Mr. Trump himself. Mr. Schumer said dealing with the president is “like negotiating with Jell-O.” And that was a key factor precipitating the weekend’s shutdown. One Republican strategist said Mr. Trump’s lack of any clear convictions, combined with his ignorance of basic policy matters, “emboldens all parties to take positions that they won’t compromise.”","thank goodness that ’ s over. on monday the senate voted 81 to 18 and the house 266 to 150 to reopen the federal government and fund it through feb. 8, as well as to stop holding hostage the health care of almost nine million poor kids — and not a moment too soon. shutdowns may make good partisan theater, but they don ’ t make any winners. now perhaps congress will finally get around to taking up a bill to protect the nearly 700, 000 so - called dreamers, immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children — legislation that almost nine in 10 americans support. that, at least, was the offer the senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell, made in order to break the stalemate. it wasn ’ t an ironclad promise, of course, and given mr. mcconnell ’ s record, it ’ s fair of many democrats and other people of good faith to question his word. nonetheless, the spotlight is now where it should be : on the failure of president trump and republicans in congress to take care of the dreamers, despite their repeated claims that they want to. mr. trump has sent wildly contradictory messages. the dreamers, he said last february, are “ absolutely incredible kids ” who deserve to be treated “ with heart. ” and yet, in september he created this problem by ordering an end to the program if congress didn ’ t find a permanent fix by march 5. two weeks ago he promised to deliver them a “ bill of love. ” but two days later he rejected a bipartisan deal to that end. on friday, hours before the shutdown deadline, mr. trump reportedly reached an agreement with the senate minority leader, chuck schumer, which would have protected dreamers and increased border security, but he then reversed course at the urging of the anti - immigrant hawks who circle the oval office — mainly his chief of staff, john kelly, and senior adviser, stephen miller. on sunday, the president unleashed his inner mr. miller and attacked democrats who, he said, “ just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. ” so what does this white house want? no one seems to know, including mr. trump himself. mr. schumer said dealing with the president is “ like negotiating with jell - o. ” and that was a key factor precipitating the weekend ’ s shutdown. one republican strategist said mr. trump ’ s lack of any clear convictions, combined with his ignorance of basic policy matters,",0.999983429908752,0.499983406702086,1,404,3.71,3.22,6.93,0.25,0.99,5.69,10.15,1.24,0.99,1.98,2.97,1.24,2.23,0.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.46,0.5,0.5,3.71,0.25,0.25,0.5,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.74,4.21,0.5,3.47,0.25,0.0,0.0,6.44,3.96,1.98,0.74,4.9504950495049505,8.415841584158416,2.2277227722772275
HuffPost,"The Trump administration has claimed that U.S. border officials detained “nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists” last year at the Mexican border. But figures from the federal government’s Department of Customs and Border Protection reveal that only six people on a security watchlist were detained over a six-month period, OutletName reports.
The grossly inflated figure is apparently part of a strategy by the administration to whip up fear of immigrants at the southern border and support for a declaration of a national emergency by President Donald Trump so he can build his border wall.
Forty-one people on the Terrorist Screening Database were encountered at the southern border from Oct. 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018 (which is the first half of fiscal year 2018). But 35 of them were U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, leaving only six “non-U.S. persons,” OutletName said.
On the northern border, which is of little concern to the Trump administration, Customs and Border Protection stopped 91 people listed in the database — including 41 who were not American citizens or residents, OutletName reported. State Department reports on terrorism have expressed more concern about suspects traveling in from Canada than Mexico.
The 4,000 figure is apparently linked to the total number of suspected terrorists encountered worldwide in 2017 — and is even an exaggeration of that. DHS reported that there were 2,554 “encounters” that year with individuals on the terrorist watch list traveling to the U.S. Of those, 2,170 were attempting to enter by air, with 335 by land and the rest by sea. Nothing “tied them to Mexico,” The Associated Press reported.
The Trump administration is apparently claiming that the entire tally — plus an additional 1,500 — were all stopped at the Mexican border.
“Wait, wait ... I know this statistic,” Wallace said. “Do you know where those 4,000 people come or where they’re captured? Airports.”
He also cited a State Department report that found “no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from Mexico.”
Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen has so far refused to clarify the discrepancy in the statistics, saying they are classified. But she also said Friday that Customs and Border Protection had “stopped” more than 3,000 “special-interest aliens” at the border. But that’s different than the terrorist watch list and generally includes immigrants who simply come from countries of concern to the U.S., AP noted.
According to AP, citing a CATO Institute study, the only known terrorists crossing the Mexican border from 1984 to 2017 were three ethnic Albanians from Macedonia who came as children in 1984 and were arrested in the foiled plot to attack the Army base at Fort Dix in 2007.","the trump administration has claimed that u. s. border officials detained “ nearly 4, 000 known or suspected terrorists ” last year at the mexican border. but figures from the federal government ’ s department of customs and border protection reveal that only six people on a security watchlist were detained over a six - month period, outletname reports. the grossly inflated figure is apparently part of a strategy by the administration to whip up fear of immigrants at the southern border and support for a declaration of a national emergency by president donald trump so he can build his border wall. forty - one people on the terrorist screening database were encountered at the southern border from oct. 1, 2017, to march 31, 2018 ( which is the first half of fiscal year 2018 ). but 35 of them were u. s. citizens or legal permanent residents, leaving only six “ non - u. s. persons, ” outletname said. on the northern border, which is of little concern to the trump administration, customs and border protection stopped 91 people listed in the database — including 41 who were not american citizens or residents, outletname reported. state department reports on terrorism have expressed more concern about suspects traveling in from canada than mexico. the 4, 000 figure is apparently linked to the total number of suspected terrorists encountered worldwide in 2017 — and is even an exaggeration of that. dhs reported that there were 2, 554 “ encounters ” that year with individuals on the terrorist watch list traveling to the u. s. of those, 2, 170 were attempting to enter by air, with 335 by land and the rest by sea. nothing “ tied them to mexico, ” the associated press reported. the trump administration is apparently claiming that the entire tally — plus an additional 1, 500 — were all stopped at the mexican border. “ wait, wait... i know this statistic, ” wallace said. “ do you know where those 4, 000 people come or where they ’ re captured? airports. ” he also cited a state department report that found “ no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from mexico. ” secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen has so far refused to clarify the discrepancy in the statistics, saying they are classified. but she also said friday that customs and border protection had “ stopped ” more than 3, 000 “ special - interest aliens ” at the border. but that ’ s different than the terrorist watch list and generally includes immigrants who simply come from countries of concern to the u. s.",0.996562421321868,0.496562393382192,1,410,7.07,5.12,2.93,0.0,0.24,2.68,9.02,2.93,0.0,0.49,2.44,0.24,4.15,0.0,0.24,0.24,0.0,0.0,9.27,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.73,0.0,0.49,3.41,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.98,11.46,1.71,8.54,1.95,0.0,0.0,3.17,4.39,2.68,0.0,7.804878048780488,7.317073170731707,0.7317073170731708
NYTimes,"A difficult situation for migrant children in government custody could grow more challenging if the largest provider in the overburdened shelter system were to lose its grants.
The provider, Southwest Key Programs, faces mounting pressure after a video of staff members abusing children surfaced last month and the Justice Department opened an investigation into its finances. State and federal officials have cracked down on suspected malfeasance at shelters in the past year, closing multiple facilities, including two run by Southwest Key, and moving children elsewhere.
But taking any broader action on Southwest Key, a nonprofit that houses almost a third of detained migrant youth, would be a balancing act for officials as they tried to avoid tipping an overstressed system into chaos. Without adequate shelter space, minors remain stuck at border stations ill-equipped to care for them.

NYTimes,"What does “pro-life, pro-family” really mean? The idea behind that phrase has long been an important organizing principle for pro-life groups like Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council. For many who work for these organizations — or who vote for candidates endorsed by them — being “pro-life, pro-family” is not a euphemism for opposing abortion and same-sex marriage. It acknowledges that protecting children, including ones not yet born, often requires protecting and supporting their mothers and families too. We are in the midst of a serious crisis for vulnerable children and families, though, and these “pro-life, pro-family” organizations have been largely silent. The crisis is the Trump administration’s practice of separating children from undocumented parents, even when the families are asking for asylum. In one particularly horrific case, a mother said that her baby was taken from her while she was breast-feeding. The number of children being taken is so large that the administration, using the fear these children must feel as a means of deterring undocumented immigration, is apparently building “tent cities” around military bases to house them. Given their support of the administration, and an unwillingness to speak critically about immigration policy, “pro-life, pro-family” organizations now risk being tied to these and other horrific practices. Some church groups and leaders have followed their broad pro-life commitments in condemning these practices. Evangelical leaders like Russell Moore and Samuel Rodriguez have signed a public letter of protest to the administration. “The traumatic effects of this separation on these young children, which could be devastating and long-lasting, are of utmost concern,” they wrote. On Wednesday, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, denounced the Trump administration’s immigration policy. “We urge courts and policymakers to respect and enhance, not erode, the potential of our asylum system to preserve and protect the right to life,” he said. Catholic bishops in border states and cities have been particularly scathing. “Separating immigrant parents and children as a supposed deterrent to immigration is a cruel and reprehensible policy,” Bishop Daniel Flores of Brownsville, Tex., recently wrote. During the 2016 presidential campaign, I spoke with Bishop Flores about mass deportation. He called the policies intrinsically evil. Because it regularly forces children into places where their lives are under threat, Bishop Flores argued, it is “not unlike driving someone to an abortion clinic.” So why can’t the biggest pro-life organizations join these religious leaders in condemning the administration’s treatment of children? Where is National Right to Life? Where is the Susan B. Anthony List? The leadership of the Susan B. Anthony List, one of the most powerful pro-life groups in the country, originally had harsh things to say about Donald Trump as a candidate. They were “disgusted” by the way he treated people, and “women, in particular.” It was “anyone but Donald Trump.” It is true that the president’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, seems likely to be anti-abortion, as do several federal judges who have been confirmed under Mr. Trump. His appointments and policies with respect to the Department of Health and Human Services have been similarly anti-abortion. But this is nothing like a turning point for the movement. People opposed to abortion got some short-term gains, all of which could be easily reversed by the next administration, and some judges about whom they must wait and see. And these modest gains have cost the movement greatly. In standing by President Trump and his administration — and, indeed, in now honoring him as their standard-bearer — traditional pro-life leaders have put short-term and uncertain political gain ahead of consistent moral principle. Because of their support of the president and general silence on his administration’s actions, the major players in the pro-life movement are now tethered to his horrific border policies. This presents a real threat to the broader movement’s capacity to be taken seriously by young people and people of color. The silence on the border policies is not a simple question of groups keeping a focus solely on abortion. Many pro-life organizations also do extensive work opposing euthanasia. There is nothing in principle compelling such organizations to ignore anti-life and anti-family border policies. If the traditional pro-life movement is to regain credibility as something other than a tool of the Trump administration, it must speak out clearly and forcefully against harming innocent children as a means of deterring undocumented immigration. These groups have extraordinary access and influence in the White House. They have to use it.","what does “ pro - life, pro - family ” really mean? the idea behind that phrase has long been an important organizing principle for pro - life groups like focus on the family and the family research council. for many who work for these organizations — or who vote for candidates endorsed by them — being “ pro - life, pro - family ” is not a euphemism for opposing abortion and same - sex marriage. it acknowledges that protecting children, including ones not yet born, often requires protecting and supporting their mothers and families too. we are in the midst of a serious crisis for vulnerable children and families, though, and these “ pro - life, pro - family ” organizations have been largely silent. the crisis is the trump administration ’ s practice of separating children from undocumented parents, even when the families are asking for asylum. in one particularly horrific case, a mother said that her baby was taken from her while she was breast - feeding. the number of children being taken is so large that the administration, using the fear these children must feel as a means of deterring undocumented immigration, is apparently building “ tent cities ” around military bases to house them. given their support of the administration, and an unwillingness to speak critically about immigration policy, “ pro - life, pro - family ” organizations now risk being tied to these and other horrific practices. some church groups and leaders have followed their broad pro - life commitments in condemning these practices. evangelical leaders like russell moore and samuel rodriguez have signed a public letter of protest to the administration. “ the traumatic effects of this separation on these young children, which could be devastating and long - lasting, are of utmost concern, ” they wrote. on wednesday, cardinal daniel dinardo, president of the united states conference of catholic bishops, denounced the trump administration ’ s immigration policy. “ we urge courts and policymakers to respect and enhance, not erode, the potential of our asylum system to preserve and protect the right to life, ” he said. catholic bishops in border states and cities have been particularly scathing. “ separating immigrant parents and children as a supposed deterrent to immigration is a cruel and reprehensible policy, ” bishop daniel flores of brownsville, tex., recently wrote. during the 2016 presidential campaign, i spoke with bishop flores about mass deportation. he called the policies intrinsically evil. because it regularly forces children into places where their lives are under threat, bishop flores argued, it is “ not unlike driving someone to an abortion clinic. ” so",0.999975800514221,0.499975768871082,1,407,0.49,1.97,9.34,4.18,0.98,4.18,8.6,1.47,1.23,0.74,1.97,0.49,3.19,0.0,1.47,0.74,0.49,0.0,19.9,3.69,0.0,1.23,0.49,0.0,0.25,4.42,0.25,2.21,1.97,0.98,0.0,0.74,0.25,0.0,0.0,1.72,6.14,0.25,4.91,0.25,0.25,0.25,2.95,4.42,3.93,0.25,8.5995085995086,10.073710073710075,1.4742014742014742

Sadly, many of the public officials have been in a state of denial and have no sense of urgency for this crisis. This warped sense of reality is also the sentiment by other public figures trying to win elections.
The Ohio and New England regions have been especially hard hit by the opioid crisis. If it wasn’t for our dedicated first responders who administer Narcan daily, the death rates would be through the roof.
We have seen successful law enforcement operations all over these regions taking down massive amounts of fentanyl and heroin while arresting numerous criminals. Two milligrams of fentanyl can kill an adult, according to the experts in the DEA. That equates to the fact that over 200,000 people can die from one pound of this poison.
Yes, it’s true our population first started consuming mass amounts of opioids from the medicine cabinet and there has been serious over prescribing for years. But now the addicted have turned to a less expensive alternative on the streets.
Unfortunately, the cartels don’t have any quality control and are mixing the poisonous chemicals with heroin and cocaine and making counterfeit pills with fentanyl. The addicted are unfamiliar with the substances they are taking, and in many cases, it’s too late.
Parents, teachers and educators have not been properly informed, and our nation’s leaders must step up.
I am fortunate to be involved in a nationwide campaign to educate the public in the “Not in Vein” heroin, fentanyl and opioid documentary. The producers of the film were inspired after hearing the tragic loss of 20-year-old Marin Riggs from Ohio.
Like Marin’s mother stated, “She’s now a pissed off mom.” Her words touched the film producers and others like me to step up and help with an aggressive awareness initiative. We feel Heidi Riggs’s pain and want to prevent more tragedy.
It’s obvious to me that many politicians have mislabeled the drug crisis as a prescription drug problem and an over-prescribing issue. There is plenty of blame to go around. Many politicians won’t blame the cartels for the deaths and do so deliberately for political reasons. It’s easier for them if they ignore the real cause.
Let’s be clear: In 2018, illicit drugs distributed by cartels are driving this crisis and the public needs to know the truth. According to research from the American Action Forum, in many parts of the country, prescription drug overdoses are down as illicit cartel drug overdoses are up.
Thanks to President Trump for addressing the crisis in Massachusetts and New Hampshire for what it is, a cartel invasion to spread their poison and make tons of money.
We need to use the brave personnel of ICE and remove these criminal aliens contributing to the destruction of our society. Now it’s time for Congress to provide real solutions. They need to provide the resources for better border security and must update the antiquated laws that no longer make sense.
Congress must secure the border to stem the tide of illegal drugs and brutal cartel activity.","if you look at the latest multi - agency law enforcement operation during october 2018 in lawrence, massachusetts, it should be very apparent that our country has been invaded by the violent mexican cartels. they are making millions of dollars and taking complete advantage of the addicted population. the street networks of cartels and illegal immigrants are moving around the region, pushing poison to our citizens, and thriving. they are currently the driving force behind the nation ’ s unprecedented drug crisis. politicians need to step up and secure the border now. we can ’ t afford to lose americans at the alarming rate of almost 200 per day to drug overdoses. the massive busts in lawrence depict how bad the situation is around the united states as ice detained or issued indictments for 50 illegal or criminal aliens who were operating with this organization. officials in the area have made it clear that the sanctuary policies of lawrence has provided the illegals with a safe haven to operate and ultimately kill our citizens. sadly, many of the public officials have been in a state of denial and have no sense of urgency for this crisis. this warped sense of reality is also the sentiment by other public figures trying to win elections. the ohio and new england regions have been especially hard hit by the opioid crisis. if it wasn ’ t for our dedicated first responders who administer narcan daily, the death rates would be through the roof. we have seen successful law enforcement operations all over these regions taking down massive amounts of fentanyl and heroin while arresting numerous criminals. two milligrams of fentanyl can kill an adult, according to the experts in the dea. that equates to the fact that over 200, 000 people can die from one pound of this poison. yes, it ’ s true our population first started consuming mass amounts of opioids from the medicine cabinet and there has been serious over prescribing for years. but now the addicted have turned to a less expensive alternative on the streets. unfortunately, the cartels don ’ t have any quality control and are mixing the poisonous chemicals with heroin and cocaine and making counterfeit pills with fentanyl. the addicted are unfamiliar with the substances they are taking, and in many cases, it ’ s too late. parents, teachers and educators have not been properly informed, and our nation ’ s leaders must step up. i am fortunate to be involved in a nationwide campaign to educate the public in the “ not in vein ” heroin, fentanyl and opioid documentary. the producers of the",0.0003848090127576,0.49961519241333,0,430,2.33,4.88,7.91,2.09,1.4,4.88,8.6,1.16,1.63,1.86,1.4,0.23,2.09,0.0,0.93,0.23,0.23,0.23,9.3,1.16,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.09,0.47,0.0,6.74,4.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.93,0.7,1.63,9.3,1.4,6.28,0.7,0.0,0.7,3.49,2.79,4.19,0.0,4.651162790697675,8.13953488372093,2.3255813953488373
CNN,"Top Mexican officials are expected to arrive in Washington for talks with senior officials in the Trump administration Wednesday -- the same day the White House is announcing plans for building a wall on the border -- hoping to turn the page after a period of tense relations.
Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, who has led talks between the Mexican government and the Trump transition team, and Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo are approaching the meetings on trade, security and immigration with a similar negotiating strategy to the ""America First"" policy President Donald Trump reaffirmed Friday in his inauguration speech.
""We say Mexico first,"" a senior Mexican diplomat told OutletName on the eve of the two-day visit. ""If they want to re-visit the relationship, then we say, yes. Let's see what they want, what they bring to the table and how it can better benefit us.""
Another Mexican diplomat said, ""We are coming to defend 25 years of unprecedented levels of cooperation. There is a lot of anger that we have become this punching bag and because of the lack of context in portraying Mexicans through one negative lens.""
The ministers are scheduled to meet with several top White House officials, including Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, Trump son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and chief strategist Steve Bannon before President Enrique Peña Nieto meets with Trump on January 31.
They are also expected to meet John Kelly, the newly sworn-in Secretary of Homeland Security, as well as members of Trump's economic team.
Mexican diplomats said the delegation comes prepared to remind the White House that Mexico has cards to play, too.
Most important among them is cooperation on deporting thousands of Central American immigrants before they reach the US. On the economic front, Mexico is the one of the largest trading partners to more than half of the American states.
""More than five million US jobs depend on selling things to Mexico,"" said Earl Anthony Wayne, who served as US Ambassador to Mexico from 2011 to 2015. ""If we want to track terrorists and others trying to get into the US, Mexico plays an important role. If we want to get better at criminal and drug organizations that operate in Mexico, they are critical. All of this needs to be done with deepening trust and cooperation.""
The delegation will be the first foreign dignitaries to visit Washington since Trump took office, after his fiery anti-Mexico campaign rhetoric and his pledges to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, deport illegal immigrants from the US, and build a wall on the Mexican border.
Trump, who said earlier this month negotiations on the border wall would begin ""immediately"" upon taking office, is expected to take executive action Wednesday directing federal resources toward building it.
Peña Nieto said his government is prepared to negotiate with the US if Mexico's national sovereignty is respected.
In a speech Monday, he laid out economic integration and respect for the rights of migrants and the money they send home as his nation's key negotiating points.
Trump has suggested some of the $25 billion in annual remittances that migrants return home would be retained to pay for the border wall -- a project Mexico opposes and which Pena Nieto has aid Mexico would never pay for.
""Neither confrontation nor submission. Dialogue is the solution,"" Peña Nieto said Monday.
The White House said Trump has already spoken to both Peña Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau about his desire to renegotiate NAFTA and would be discussing the issue further when he meets with both leaders in the coming weeks. Trump has suggested negotiating bilateral trade deals with each of America's neighbors.
""We are low-hanging fruit because we and Canada are probably the two countries that have the most at stake,"" the Mexican official said. ""But anyone who thinks they can walk back the integration we have achieved over the last 20 since NAFTA will pay a very heavy price.""
Steve Schwarzman, the CEO of Blackstone Group who is serving as an adviser to the Trump administration, told a group of Canadian officials week that Canada had a ""very special status"" and ""things should go well for Canada"" in trade talks with the US.
As he prepared to leave for Washington, Guajardo, the economy minister, said Latin America's second-largest economy was prepared to leave NAFTA if the new terms didn't benefit Mexicans.
""There could be no other option. Go for something that is less than what we already have? It would not make sense to stay,"" Guajardo told Mexican television, ""The strategy for this treaty needs to be one in which everyone wins. It's impossible to sell it here at home if there aren't clear benefits for Mexico.""
Videgaray, one of Pena Nieto's most trusted advisers, was forced to resign as finance minister in September after arranging Trump's visit to Mexico City, which was widely viewed as a public relations disaster for Peña Nieto.
But earlier this month, Peña Nieto appointed him as foreign secretary to boost ties with the incoming Trump team. Videgaray has spoken several times to Kushner since Trump took office, describing him to aides as ""articulate, pragmatic and a very good messenger"" for the President.
""There is nobody the President trusts more,"" one Mexican official said of Kushner. ""He is someone who brings context, nuance and common sense to his father-in-law.""
This week's talks are expected to lay the groundwork for Peña Nieto's visit next week, which Mexican diplomats see as an important opportunity to get past the anti-Mexico rhetoric Trump used during the campaign and a chance to put the US-Mexico relationship back on track.
""There is ... frustration with our government and ourselves that we have not been able to tell the story of this important relationship,"" a Mexican diplomat said. ""There are a lot of stereotypes of Mexicans in the US, but there are also stereotypes of Americans in Mexico. It is in the interest of both governments to explain what this relationship is and what we can do together.""
The diplomat said it was too early to say if US-Mexico ties have suffered long-term damage from the negative comments Trump made during the campaign. ""A lot of this will depend on how Trump explains the value of our relationship,"" he said.
Wayne, the former US ambassador to Mexico, agreed that Trump's tone during Peña Nieto's visit would be important to holding a constructive set of talks.
""There is growing popular pressure to standup up to this new tone of coming out of North America,"" Wayne said.
He said Trump would do well to repeat his demeanor during his visit to Mexico City, where he was much more respectful than he was during the campaign
""It didn't change the substance, but it was done in a way of two partners talking to one another,"" Wayne said.","top mexican officials are expected to arrive in washington for talks with senior officials in the trump administration wednesday - - the same day the white house is announcing plans for building a wall on the border - - hoping to turn the page after a period of tense relations. foreign minister luis videgaray, who has led talks between the mexican government and the trump transition team, and economy minister ildefonso guajardo are approaching the meetings on trade, security and immigration with a similar negotiating strategy to the "" america first "" policy president donald trump reaffirmed friday in his inauguration speech.

HuffPost,"More than 37,000 visa applications were rejected by the U.S. State Department in 2018 due to President Trump’s travel ban, according to data released on Tuesday. Visa denials are up by at least 1,000 over the year before.
The final iteration of Executive Order 13769, which was upheld by the Supreme Court last year, barred citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, as well as citizens from North Korea and Venezuela, from entering the United States. The State Department numbers provide a telling look at the impact of the ruling since the ban was enacted.
Of those total rejections, 15,384 applicants were denied immigrant visas granted to those who wished to seek permanent residence within the U.S.
An additional 21,645 applications were denied to those who sought non-immigrant visas, such as those who sought short-term visits to the U.S., usually for tourism or business.
The ban was widely criticized as unconstitutional and discriminatory toward Muslims, pointing to the fact the many of the countries listed were Muslim-majority countries. The ban was challenged multiple times in the lower court before the final decision was upheld.
Although the newest data set does not include a breakdown of denied applications by country, previous figures show that the number of visas issued to people from five of the Muslim-majority countries listed in the ban — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen — dropped by 80 percent between 2016 to 2018.","more than 37, 000 visa applications were rejected by the u. s. state department in 2018 due to president trump ’ s travel ban, according to data released on tuesday. visa denials are up by at least 1, 000 over the year before. the final iteration of executive order 13769, which was upheld by the supreme court last year, barred citizens from seven muslim - majority countries, as well as citizens from north korea and venezuela, from entering the united states. the state department numbers provide a telling look at the impact of the ruling since the ban was enacted. of those total rejections, 15, 384 applicants were denied immigrant visas granted to those who wished to seek permanent residence within the u. s. an additional 21, 645 applications were denied to those who sought non - immigrant visas, such as those who sought short - term visits to the u. s., usually for tourism or business. the ban was widely criticized as unconstitutional and discriminatory toward muslims, pointing to the fact the many of the countries listed were muslim - majority countries. the ban was challenged multiple times in the lower court before the final decision was upheld. although the newest data set does not include a breakdown of denied applications by country, previous figures show that the number of visas issued to people from five of the muslim - majority countries listed in the ban — iran, libya, somalia, syria and yemen — dropped by 80 percent between 2016 to 2018.",0.999953269958496,0.499953214235575,1,245,6.12,7.35,5.31,0.0,0.41,4.9,4.9,0.82,1.22,0.41,0.82,0.0,2.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.41,3.27,0.41,1.63,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.16,1.22,4.9,0.82,0.0,0.0,6.53,6.94,1.22,0.0,3.2653061224489797,6.938775510204081,1.2244897959183674

Breitbart,"Three-quarters of Republicans support President Donald J. Trump declaring a national emergency to build a wall along America’s southern border, according to a poll released on Wednesday.
Seventy-six percent of Republicans support President Trump declaring a national emergency to build a wall along the southern border, according to a Morning Consult/Politico survey released on Wednesday.
The poll found that 52 percent of Republicans “strongly support” Trump declaring a national emergency and 24 percent of Republicans somewhat support the president using emergency powers to build a wall.
In contrast, 71 percent of Democrats strongly oppose Trump using building the wall through a national emergency.
When given the choice of whether Trump should shut down the government, Trump should declare an emergency, or Trump should do neither of these options, a near majority of Republican voters said that Trump should declare a national emergency and 12 percent somewhat oppose such a measure.
Forty-seven percent of Republican voters said that Trump should declare a national emergency, 20 percent of Republican voters said that Trump should shut down the government again, and 22 percent said that Trump should do neither of these options.
The poll arises as President Trump recently ended the longest government shutdown in American history in his quest to obtain border wall funding. Congress has re-opened the government until February 15; however, Trump said that there remains a “good chance” he could declare a national emergency to build the wall if Congress will not fund the border wall.
Overall, 81 percent of Republicans approve of President Trump’s job performance, with 51 percent of GOP voters strongly approving of the president’s handling of the presidency.
The Morning Consult survey also suggested that Republican voters believe it’s increasingly unlike that Congress will provide funding for Trump to build the wall.
At the beginning of the shutdown, 54 percent of GOP voters said that it remains unlikely that Congress will provide full funding for Trump’s proposed border wall along the American southern border. Now, 64 percent of Republicans voters believe Congress will not likely provide full funding for the wall.
Amongst registered voters, Republicans hold an advantage on the issue of immigration. Forty percent of voters said that they trust Republicans in Congress to handle immigration, while 38 percent Democrats, and 21 percent of voters that they either did not know or did not have an opinion.
Forty-six percent of Republican voters, or a near majority, said that building a wall along the southern border wall serves as a top priority, and 30 percent of GOP voters said it was an important, but lower priority. Meanwhile, 50 percent of Democrats said that America should not build a wall.
Trump has continued to push Congress to pass a border security bill that contains border wall funding, although he has stated that if Congress cannot fulfill its duties to secure the country’s border, then he might declare a national emergency.
“I think we have a good chance,” Trump said at the White House last week. “We’ll work with the Democrats and negotiate and if we can’t do that, then obviously we’ll do the emergency because that’s what it is. It’s a national emergency.”","three - quarters of republicans support president donald j. trump declaring a national emergency to build a wall along america ’ s southern border, according to a poll released on wednesday. seventy - six percent of republicans support president trump declaring a national emergency to build a wall along the southern border, according to a morning consult / politico survey released on wednesday. the poll found that 52 percent of republicans “ strongly support ” trump declaring a national emergency and 24 percent of republicans somewhat support the president using emergency powers to build a wall. in contrast, 71 percent of democrats strongly oppose trump using building the wall through a national emergency. when given the choice of whether trump should shut down the government, trump should declare an emergency, or trump should do neither of these options, a near majority of republican voters said that trump should declare a national emergency and 12 percent somewhat oppose such a measure. forty - seven percent of republican voters said that trump should declare a national emergency, 20 percent of republican voters said that trump should shut down the government again, and 22 percent said that trump should do neither of these options. the poll arises as president trump recently ended the longest government shutdown in american history in his quest to obtain border wall funding. congress has re - opened the government until february 15 ; however, trump said that there remains a “ good chance ” he could declare a national emergency to build the wall if congress will not fund the border wall. overall, 81 percent of republicans approve of president trump ’ s job performance, with 51 percent of gop voters strongly approving of the president ’ s handling of the presidency. the morning consult survey also suggested that republican voters believe it ’ s increasingly unlike that congress will provide funding for trump to build the wall. at the beginning of the shutdown, 54 percent of gop voters said that it remains unlikely that congress will provide full funding for trump ’ s proposed border wall along the american southern border. now, 64 percent of republicans voters believe congress will not likely provide full funding for the wall. amongst registered voters, republicans hold an advantage on the issue of immigration. forty percent of voters said that they trust republicans in congress to handle immigration, while 38 percent democrats, and 21 percent of voters that they either did not know or did not have an opinion. forty - six percent of republican voters, or a near majority, said that building a wall along the southern border wall serves as a top priority, and 30 percent of gop voters said it was an important, but lower priority. meanwhile, 50 percent of democrats said that",5.1258077292e-05,0.499948740005493,0,449,4.45,6.68,6.9,0.22,0.22,6.68,9.13,1.34,0.45,1.78,2.23,0.0,4.01,0.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.13,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.45,0.0,0.0,2.45,1.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.22,0.0,9.58,0.0,9.58,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.34,4.45,1.11,1.11,5.79064587973274,10.46770601336303,0.8908685968819599
FoxNews,"President Trump has announced a set of immigration reforms, many of which have merit. Even he acknowledges there’s little chance that Congress will act on them at least until after the 2020 elections. Yet the crisis at our border continues, as even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi now acknowledges. But there’s also a crisis of trust – trust in our government’s ability to solve big challenges. We feel this deeply: America is a nation of laws. It must have borders and it must enforce its laws impartially and consistently. We’re doing neither. And with every day the trust gap widens. Do we trust that anyone in the federal government will really do something to address what is beyond question a broken immigration system? Finally, we don’t have to trust – we can see that President Trump has taken action. We have a broken immigration system. Our borders are so porous that they encourage the greedy and cruel to take advantage of those seeking a better life. Human trafficking continues unabated and unchallenged. “Sanctuary cities” make a mockery of the rule of law. We have a broken asylum system that can’t effectively distinguish between those fleeing real threats from those simply looking for better economic opportunities. And we have a broken guest worker program that leaves people frustrated at the border and in boardrooms. These problems have been ongoing and festering for the better part of five decades. Thankfully, the administration has now courageously stepped into the morass and offered at least a partial guidepost for making real and lasting progress on the current crisis, as well as longstanding problems with our system. We must start with the border. This is not simply a talking point. Securing the border, adequately policing our points of entry, erecting physical and virtual barriers, and obtaining operational control of who comes in and out of this country are prerequisites for any lasting future legal immigration reform. The United States ought to know who is entering its borders, and for what purposes. A laughably insecure border only encourages the lawless drug cartels who are reaping billions of dollars from the new revenue stream of immigrants who wish to enter our country. The president’s proposal takes a strong step in the right direction by strengthening immigration and enforcement agencies, making the necessary investments along the southern border, and closing the loopholes that are exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. It is encouraging to see the administration prioritize a workable system for asylum-seekers. We should offer America’s protection to those who are truly persecuted in their own homelands, but we must be able to determine that those threats are real – that the migrant isn’t simply reading from a script provided by traffickers or other bad-faith actors. Poverty is not a credible basis for asylum because America cannot house the world’s impoverished. We must also recognize the important role immigration plays in our economy. American prosperity requires the industry and insight immigrants have always brought to America. President Trump’s proposal to grant more green cards based on merit, rather than family relationships, is a good idea. Nations like Australia and Canada have proven this works. As our economy becomes increasingly high-tech, we will need the highly skilled workers that a merit-based approach would provide. And finally, we need a guest-worker program that ends the black market for labor. We can have an efficient system that helps industries – such as farming, service, and hospitality – find the workers they need while also broadly protecting American wages. The government’s historical approach, de facto non-enforcement, is lawlessness – and lawlessness is, in fact, what millions are fleeing. It’s why they want to come to America. Why would we want to imitate that lawlessness here? President Trump says his plan is “pro-American, pro-immigrant and pro-worker.” We should all be able to agree that those are worthy goals. The crisis at the border is real, and so is the crisis of faith in our government. Our elected officials can address both, by keeping their promises, enforcing our laws and ultimately, securing the border, and reforming our immigration system.

NYTimes,"The State of the Union address was a herky-jerky testament to that. I say herky-jerky because it was six or eight or maybe 10 speeches in one, caroming without warning from a plea for unity to a tirade about the border; from some boast about American glory under Trump to some reverie about American glory before Trump (yes, it existed!); from a hurried legislative wish list to a final stretch of ersatz poetry that read like lines from a batch of defective or remaindered Hallmark cards. As much as Trump needed modesty, his paragraphs needed transitions.
But there was a leitmotif running through the disparate patches, and it was Trump’s readiness to reassemble recent history and reinvent himself.

On Tuesday night he ached for Americans with H.I.V. or AIDS. I can’t recall them being on his radar much before, but I do recall that he or other members of his administration worked to expel transgender people from the military, appoint homophobic judges and argue against civil rights protections for L.G.B.T. Americans.
On Tuesday night he excoriated wealthy Americans who benefit from undocumented immigrants even as those immigrants (supposedly) diminish less wealthy Americans. He made no acknowledgment of his own use of undocumented immigrants at the Trump golf resort in Bedminster, N.J. Two of them, in fact, were invited by Democrats to the speech.
On Tuesday night he said that we Americans “must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism or those who spread its venomous creed.” And he himself has not ignored those who spread it; rather, he has defended and encouraged them — by accepting their support during his campaign, by re-tweeting them, by insisting that some of the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville, Va., and railed against Jews were good people.","the state of the union address was a herky - jerky testament to that. i say herky - jerky because it was six or eight or maybe 10 speeches in one, caroming without warning from a plea for unity to a tirade about the border ; from some boast about american glory under trump to some reverie about american glory before trump ( yes, it existed! ) ; from a hurried legislative wish list to a final stretch of ersatz poetry that read like lines from a batch of defective or remaindered hallmark cards. as much as trump needed modesty, his paragraphs needed transitions. but there was a leitmotif running through the disparate patches, and it was trump ’ s readiness to reassemble recent history and reinvent himself. if you didn ’ t know that he was a champion of women, then you probably also didn ’ t know that he saved us from war with north korea. he alone can fix it! and according to him, he did fix it, or is fixing it, never mind what his intelligence chiefs told the senate intelligence committee just last week. they had doubts about his supposed success on that front. he doesn ’ t. so he ’ ll cling to his version. it ’ s the one that flatters him. on tuesday night trump suddenly cared about diversity and minorities, and abandoned much of the divisive lexicon that he had used over the first two years of his presidency, most memorably when he attached a fecal epithet to countries with largely black populations. on tuesday night he ached for americans with h. i. v. or aids. i can ’ t recall them being on his radar much before, but i do recall that he or other members of his administration worked to expel transgender people from the military, appoint homophobic judges and argue against civil rights protections for l. g. b. t. americans. on tuesday night he excoriated wealthy americans who benefit from undocumented immigrants even as those immigrants ( supposedly ) diminish less wealthy americans. he made no acknowledgment of his own use of undocumented immigrants at the trump golf resort in bedminster, n. j. two of them, in fact, were invited by democrats to the speech. on tuesday night he said that we americans “ must never ignore the vile poison of anti - semitism or those who spread its venomous creed. ” and he himself has not ignored those who spread it ; rather, he has defended",0.999977588653564,0.499977600680722,1,400,1.75,4.0,6.25,1.25,1.25,4.25,9.75,1.0,1.0,1.25,3.75,0.0,4.25,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.25,0.0,14.5,0.0,0.0,0.25,6.75,0.5,0.0,0.75,0.5,0.25,1.25,0.75,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.75,5.0,0.5,3.25,0.25,0.0,0.25,5.5,5.0,1.25,0.0,3.0,10.25,1.5
FoxNews,"President Donald Trump’s proposed border security measures are undermining bipartisan negotiations on Capitol Hill -- and could potentially lead to a government shutdown, a top Senate Democrat said Friday.
U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-ranking Senate Democrat, called Trump’s plans -- including $18 billion for a border wall -- at the expense of months of bipartisan efforts, “outrageous.”
Republicans countered that the Democrats' proposals for immigration were just as “ridiculous.”

NYTimes,"After President Trump signed two sweeping executive orders on immigration on Wednesday, most of the attention was on his plans to build a wall along the border with Mexico and to hold back money from “sanctuary cities.” But the most immediate effect may come from language about deportation priorities that is tucked into the border wall order. It offers an expansive definition of who is considered a criminal — a category of people Mr. Trump has said he would target for deportation. Immigration agents will now have wider latitude to enforce federal laws and are being encouraged to deport broad swaths of unauthorized immigrants. Here are some questions and answers about the changes: Who is considered a priority for deportation?
Each presidential administration must decide who it considers a priority for deportation. Mr. Trump’s order focuses on anyone who has been charged with a criminal offense, even if it has not led to a conviction. He also includes, according to language in the order, anyone who has “committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense,” meaning anyone the authorities believe has broken any type of law — regardless of whether that person has been charged with a crime. Mr. Trump’s order also includes anyone who has engaged in “fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency,” a category that includes anyone who has used a false Social Security number to obtain a job, as many unauthorized immigrants do. Anyone who has received a final order to leave the country, but has not left, is also considered a priority. Finally, he allows the targeting of anyone who “in the judgment of an immigration officer” poses a risk to either public safety or national security. That gives immigration officers the broad authority they have been pressing for, and no longer requires them to receive a review from a supervisor before targeting individuals. Who is considered a criminal?
The order defines criminal loosely, and includes anyone who has crossed the border illegally — which is a criminal misdemeanor. Anyone who has abused any public benefits program is also considered a criminal under the order. The Obama administration, which deported nearly 400,000 people per year during its first five years, initially included those convicted of minor offenses such as shoplifting. But it later changed its policy to target primarily those who had been convicted of serious crimes, were considered national security threats or were recent arrivals. By the end of President Barack Obama’s time in office, around 90 percent of the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants were not considered a priority for deportation. According to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, roughly 820,000 undocumented immigrants currently have a criminal record. Who could be affected by this?
It’s impossible to know how many people will be considered priorities for deportation under the new criteria. Mr. Trump’s executive order could affect any unauthorized immigrant who is not protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which the Obama administration put in place to give young people work permits and temporary relief from deportation. (Mr. Trump has not yet made clear whether he intends to keep that program.) Immigration lawyers have already raised concerns that people with no criminal history will be swept up by the large net the administration is casting. Can the president carry out these changes?
The president has the authority to decide who should be deported. But it is unclear whether the administration will be able to — or even try to — carry out deportations as expansively as suggested in the executive order’s language. First, in order to put the 15,000 additional immigration agents he wants in place around the country and along the border, Mr. Trump needs spending approval from Congress. Even then, additional detention centers would also be needed. The most significant hurdle is the tremendous backlog in the immigration courts. Even if immigration officials initiated thousands of deportations immediately, court dates for those immigrants would be at least a year and a half away. Some immigration experts have suggested that Mr. Trump will try to push for expedited removals, which could speed the process, and give immigrants less time to find legal representation. How does this compare with previous administrations?
Mr. Trump is opening the door to deporting far more unauthorized immigrants than previous administrations. “This is the largest expansion of any president in terms of who is a priority for removal,” said Steve Yale-Loehr, a professor of immigration law at Cornell University. “Every administration has to prioritize who they will go after with their limited enforcement resources. This goes further than any other president. To make it simple: If someone is here illegally they are targets for removal.”","after president trump signed two sweeping executive orders on immigration on wednesday, most of the attention was on his plans to build a wall along the border with mexico and to hold back money from “ sanctuary cities. ” but the most immediate effect may come from language about deportation priorities that is tucked into the border wall order. it offers an expansive definition of who is considered a criminal — a category of people mr. trump has said he would target for deportation. immigration agents will now have wider latitude to enforce federal laws and are being encouraged to deport broad swaths of unauthorized immigrants. here are some questions and answers about the changes : who is considered a priority for deportation? each presidential administration must decide who it considers a priority for deportation. mr. trump ’ s order focuses on anyone who has been charged with a criminal offense, even if it has not led to a conviction. he also includes, according to language in the order, anyone who has “ committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense, ” meaning anyone the authorities believe has broken any type of law — regardless of whether that person has been charged with a crime. mr. trump ’ s order also includes anyone who has engaged in “ fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency, ” a category that includes anyone who has used a false social security number to obtain a job, as many unauthorized immigrants do. anyone who has received a final order to leave the country, but has not left, is also considered a priority. finally, he allows the targeting of anyone who “ in the judgment of an immigration officer ” poses a risk to either public safety or national security. that gives immigration officers the broad authority they have been pressing for, and no longer requires them to receive a review from a supervisor before targeting individuals. who is considered a criminal? the order defines criminal loosely, and includes anyone who has crossed the border illegally — which is a criminal misdemeanor. anyone who has abused any public benefits program is also considered a criminal under the order. the obama administration, which deported nearly 400, 000 people per year during its first five years, initially included those convicted of minor offenses such as shoplifting. but it later changed its policy to target primarily those who had been convicted of serious crimes, were considered national security threats or were recent arrivals. by the end of president barack obama ’ s time in office, around 90 percent of the country ’ s 11 million undocumented immigrants were not considered a priority for deportation. according to the migration",0.999979376792907,0.499979418671501,1,443,1.81,3.39,7.0,0.23,0.45,6.32,13.32,4.06,1.35,0.45,4.74,0.0,3.61,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.58,0.0,0.23,2.48,0.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23,1.35,8.13,1.13,6.55,0.0,0.0,0.23,4.06,5.19,6.55,0.68,8.126410835214447,10.835214446952596,1.1286681715575622
Daily Caller,"President Donald Trump vowed to close the southern border if necessary in response to the advancing caravan of illegal immigrants from Central America, in a Saturday evening Twitter declaration.

The tweets mark the second time in recent days the president has vowed the drastic step as a potential action in response to illegal immigration.
“If we find that it’s uncontrollable, if we find it gets to a level where we are going to lose control or where people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control,” Trump said of potential action while speaking to reporters Thursday.
The Trump administration already resorted to such an action in recent weeks when the Department of Homeland Security noted that it had to temporarily close the busiest port of entry between the U.S. and Mexico last week in order to reinforce barriers and harden the ports of entry.
DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen noted in an announcement on Twitter at the time that the hardening was in direct response to threats from members of the migrant caravan who reportedly wanted to storm the port of entry en masse in order to overwhelm U.S. authorities and illegally seek refuge.
Trump also told reporters that U.S. troops are authorized to use lethal force at the southern border if they need to defend themselves, saying “if they have to they’re going to use lethal force, I’ve given the order, I hope they don’t have to.” The president dispatched nearly 6,000 U.S. troops to the border in recent weeks to bolster border enforcement. Trump justified the deployment by pointing at the advancing caravan of thousands of Central American would-be migrants who want to claim asylum. The caravan used violent tactics to break through legal ports of entry in Mexico, prompting alarm amongst U.S. authorities.","president donald trump vowed to close the southern border if necessary in response to the advancing caravan of illegal immigrants from central america, in a saturday evening twitter declaration. migrants at the southern border will not be allowed into the united states until their claims are individually approved in court. we only will allow those who come into our country legally. other than that our very strong policy is catch and detain. no “ releasing ” into the u. s … — donald j. trump ( ) november 24, 2018 …. all will stay in mexico. if for any reason it becomes necessary, we will close our southern border. there is no way that the united states will, after decades of abuse, put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore! — donald j. trump ( ) november 24, 2018 the tweets mark the second time in recent days the president has vowed the drastic step as a potential action in response to illegal immigration. “ if we find that it ’ s uncontrollable, if we find it gets to a level where we are going to lose control or where people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control, ” trump said of potential action while speaking to reporters thursday. the trump administration already resorted to such an action in recent weeks when the department of homeland security noted that it had to temporarily close the busiest port of entry between the u. s. and mexico last week in order to reinforce barriers and harden the ports of entry. dhs secretary kirstjen nielsen noted in an announcement on twitter at the time that the hardening was in direct response to threats from members of the migrant caravan who reportedly wanted to storm the port of entry en masse in order to overwhelm u. s. authorities and illegally seek refuge. trump also told reporters that u. s. troops are authorized to use lethal force at the southern border if they need to defend themselves, saying “ if they have to they ’ re going to use lethal force, i ’ ve given the order, i hope they don ’ t have to. ” the president dispatched nearly 6, 000 u. s. troops to the border in recent weeks to bolster border enforcement. trump justified the deployment by pointing at the advancing caravan of thousands of central american would - be migrants who want to claim asylum. the caravan used violent tactics to break through legal ports of entry in mexico, prompting alarm amongst u. s. authorities.",3.06832916976e-05,0.499969363212585,0,424,1.89,1.89,9.67,3.07,0.24,6.37,9.43,0.94,3.54,1.42,3.07,0.0,2.36,0.24,0.71,0.24,0.24,0.0,12.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.18,0.24,0.0,0.71,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47,0.0,0.71,13.92,1.65,11.32,0.0,0.0,0.24,6.6,2.36,2.36,4.48,7.0754716981132075,8.254716981132075,0.7075471698113208
Daily Caller,"Los Angeles County paid illegal immigrant families over $1.3 billion dollars from 2015 to 2016, OutletName reports.
The metric is over a quarter of the money the county has spent on its entire low-income population. The Department of Public Social Services, the entity that assesses welfare and food stamp benefits in the county, gave a summary of costs associated with the city’s lax sanctuary policies for illegal immigrants.
According to a study from the Migration Policy Institute, Los Angeles has one of the highest concentration of undocumented people of any county in the country. It also permits undocumented families with children born in the U.S. to receive full welfare and food stamp benefits.
Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation says these costs are just “the tip of the iceberg,” when it comes to supporting illegal immigrant families.
He also notes that the state can subsidize up to $24,000 per family to pay for education, police and fire, medical, and affordable housing coverage.
Rector stated, “They get $3 in benefits for every $1 they spend.”
The Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration could reduce the population taking advantage of these government handouts. This year, Los Angeles county is expected to cut down on these benefits by almost $200 million from 2016 due to several thousand fewer undocumented families accepting state-funded welfare.
“The number of entrants nationwide is going down. The population is static if not shrinking,” Rector said.
Data from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Services shows that more than 58,000 families collected $602 million in benefits in 2015. 64,000 families received a total of $675 million in 2016. The entire county’s population cost the state $3.1 billion in total welfare and food stamps in 2015, and $2.9 billion in 2016.
A quarter of California’s 4 million undocumented immigrants currently reside in Los Angeles county.
Los Angeles’ mayor Eric Garcetti has been one of the most ardent supporters of benefits for illegal immigrants.
“Immigration is at the heart of LA’s story,” Garcetti said. “LA’s become one of the world’s great cities by embracing immigration and diversity and we’ll continue supporting anyone who wants to work hard and invest in our future – no matter who they are, where they came from or what language they speak.”","los angeles county paid illegal immigrant families over $ 1. 3 billion dollars from 2015 to 2016, outletname reports. the metric is over a quarter of the money the county has spent on its entire low - income population. the department of public social services, the entity that assesses welfare and food stamp benefits in the county, gave a summary of costs associated with the city ’ s lax sanctuary policies for illegal immigrants. according to a study from the migration policy institute, los angeles has one of the highest concentration of undocumented people of any county in the country. it also permits undocumented families with children born in the u. s. to receive full welfare and food stamp benefits. robert rector of the heritage foundation says these costs are just “ the tip of the iceberg, ” when it comes to supporting illegal immigrant families. he also notes that the state can subsidize up to $ 24, 000 per family to pay for education, police and fire, medical, and affordable housing coverage. rector stated, “ they get $ 3 in benefits for every $ 1 they spend. ” the trump administration ’ s crackdown on illegal immigration could reduce the population taking advantage of these government handouts. this year, los angeles county is expected to cut down on these benefits by almost $ 200 million from 2016 due to several thousand fewer undocumented families accepting state - funded welfare. “ the number of entrants nationwide is going down. the population is static if not shrinking, ” rector said. data from the los angeles county department of public services shows that more than 58, 000 families collected $ 602 million in benefits in 2015. 64, 000 families received a total of $ 675 million in 2016. the entire county ’ s population cost the state $ 3. 1 billion in total welfare and food stamps in 2015, and $ 2. 9 billion in 2016. a quarter of california ’ s 4 million undocumented immigrants currently reside in los angeles county. los angeles ’ mayor eric garcetti has been one of the most ardent supporters of benefits for illegal immigrants. “ immigration is at the heart of la ’ s story, ” garcetti said. “ la ’ s become one of the world ’ s great cities by embracing immigration and diversity and we ’ ll continue supporting anyone who wants to work hard and invest in our future – no matter who they are, where they came from or what language they speak. ”",2.58368618233e-05,0.499974131584167,0,393,9.16,7.89,4.83,2.8,0.51,1.78,4.07,0.25,0.25,0.76,1.27,0.0,1.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.18,1.78,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.25,3.31,3.56,0.76,1.27,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.76,0.0,1.78,0.0,8.14,0.76,7.12,0.0,0.0,0.25,1.78,2.8,3.82,1.02,9.16030534351145,9.414758269720101,0.2544529262086514
FoxNews,"Everywhere President Donald Trump looks, he sees a wall.
As he lobbies for money for his long-promised border wall, Trump keeps talking up other barricades. He's pointing to walls in Israel, at the Vatican, even at former President Barack Obama's house — though fact checkers have pushed back on the accuracy of some of his claims.
With bricks and mortar on his mind, Trump declared at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, ""Walls work.""
He added: ""There's a reason why politicians and wealthy people build walls around their houses and their compounds. President Obama recently built a wall around his compound.""
Trump also tweeted that Obama's wall was 10 feet high. But while fencing has been added around the Obamas' spacious house in Washington's tony Kalorama neighborhood, there is no 10-foot wall.
It's all part of Trump's effort to prevail in an increasingly difficult standoff with congressional Democrats over border funding that has produced a partial shutdown of the federal government.
But David Bier, an immigration policy analyst for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said there is little comparison between the demands for private security and border security.
""It doesn't make sense to compare"" the two, said Bier, pointing to the difference between a home break-in and migrants trying to seek asylum.
Another favorite structure for Trump is the fortifications at the Vatican, which he has cited in the past as an argument for the wall and brought up again at the Cabinet meeting, this time making a moral argument.
""When they say the wall is immoral, well then you better — got to do something about the Vatican, because the Vatican has the biggest wall of them all,"" Trump said.
Much of Vatican City is off-limits to the general public but walls there do not block all access. St. Peter's Square is not behind any walls. The Vatican Museums are walled but the public may enter with a ticket and security screening.
Trump's immigration policies have drawn criticism from Pope Francis, who has said in the past that anyone who wants to build walls to keep out migrants is ""not Christian.""
Former Trump aide Sam Nunberg said that in some of these examples, Trump was trying to argue that his opponents are saying ""do as I say, not as I do.""
Trump and allies have repeatedly cited barriers in Israel as proof that walls are effective. Trump said this week he had recently spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, adding ""In Israel, as you know, they built a wall. He said 99.9 percent it works. And it would with us too.""
Bier said a direct comparison with Israel's border security is challenging because the U.S. border is much longer and has different terrain, including mountains, raising questions about whether building a physical wall is the best approach.
""I think it's fair to say that border barriers make it easier to catch people who are coming into the country,"" Bier said. ""The question is whether it is as effective in areas where the president wants to build.""
With no end to the border fight in sight, Trump is likely to keep up his wall commentary — although at times his rhetoric sends mixed messages.
His message Thursday: ""You can call it a wall. You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want.""","everywhere president donald trump looks, he sees a wall. as he lobbies for money for his long - promised border wall, trump keeps talking up other barricades. he's pointing to walls in israel, at the vatican, even at former president barack obama's house — though fact checkers have pushed back on the accuracy of some of his claims. with bricks and mortar on his mind, trump declared at a cabinet meeting on wednesday, "" walls work. "" he added : "" there's a reason why politicians and wealthy people build walls around their houses and their compounds. president obama recently built a wall around his compound. "" trump also tweeted that obama's wall was 10 feet high. but while fencing has been added around the obamas'spacious house in washington's tony kalorama neighborhood, there is no 10 - foot wall. it's all part of trump's effort to prevail in an increasingly difficult standoff with congressional democrats over border funding that has produced a partial shutdown of the federal government. but david bier, an immigration policy analyst for the cato institute, a libertarian think tank, said there is little comparison between the demands for private security and border security. "" it doesn't make sense to compare "" the two, said bier, pointing to the difference between a home break - in and migrants trying to seek asylum. another favorite structure for trump is the fortifications at the vatican, which he has cited in the past as an argument for the wall and brought up again at the cabinet meeting, this time making a moral argument. "" when they say the wall is immoral, well then you better — got to do something about the vatican, because the vatican has the biggest wall of them all, "" trump said. much of vatican city is off - limits to the general public but walls there don't block all access. st. peter's square is not behind any walls. the vatican museums are walled but the public may enter with a ticket and security screening. trump's immigration policies have drawn criticism from pope francis, who has said in the past that anyone who wants to build walls to keep out migrants is "" not christian.

FoxNews,"Defense Secretary Jim Mattis defended the use of active duty troops on the U.S.-Mexican border, saying that in some ways it provides good training for war. He argued that it's analogous to a 1916 deployment to counter the Mexican revolutionary Gen. Francisco ""Pancho"" Villa.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday on his way to visit U.S. troops along the border in south Texas, Mattis declined to provide an estimate of how much the mission will cost. He said cost figures he has received thus far are ""not anywhere near right."" He added that he believes that ""very quickly we'll know the real cost. So we'll keep you posted as the real costs come in.""
In his most extensive remarks about the hastily arranged border mission, Mattis argued that it fits an historical pattern dating to early in the 20th century. He noted that President Woodrow Wilson deployed tens of thousands of National Guard and active duty troops to the border in 1916 in response to a Mexican military raid into the U.S.
""That's over a century ago, and the threat then was Pancho Villa's troops — revolutionary raiding across the border into the United States,"" he said. He noted that more recently, National Guard troops were used in border missions ordered by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, although not on the cusp of a midterm election.
The Pentagon chief said that within a week to 10 days the 5,800 troops currently deployed for the border mission will have accomplished all the tasks initially requested by Customs and Border Protection, although additional tasks are now being worked out between the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security. Mattis did not say how soon the mission might end; current deployments are scheduled to last until Dec. 15, but that could change.
In addition to the 5,800 active duty troops in the border area, about 2,100 National Guard troops have been providing border support since April.
Critics have questioned the wisdom of using the military on the border where there is no discernible security threat, although President Donald Trump has said that a caravan of Central American migrants traveling northward through Mexico amounts to an ""invasion."" Since the election, Trump has said little about the matter, and no border threat has yet materialized.
Asked whether he believes there is a security threat at the border that justifies the use of the active duty military, Mattis said he defers to the judgment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who joined him at the border Wednesday.
Nielsen and Mattis spoke with senior U.S. commanders and addressed rank-and-file troops. Mattis told the troops their mission is to ""back up"" Customs and Border Protection. ""Right now that's our role and that's all our role is,"" he said.
""The eyes of the world right now — certainly all of the Americans — are on you,"" Mattis told the soldiers, adding that they are part of a ""non-traditional"" mission. ""We're here because of the number of illegals who say they are going to illegally try to cross into our country,"" he said, apparently referring to the several thousand migrants moving north through Mexico.
One soldier asked Mattis what are the short- and long-term plans for the military mission.
Mattis said the short-term objective is to get sufficient numbers of wire and other barriers in place along the border as requested by Customs and Border Protection. The longer-term objective, he said, is ""somewhat to be determined.""
""When you're in something like this,"" Mattis said, ""it's dynamic, it's unpredictable. We'll have to see.""
In an interview with reporters traveling with him to Texas, Mattis took issue with assertions by critics that the deployment undertaken shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm elections was costing the military in preparedness for combat. He said military officers have told him that the deployment has been ""very good training"" because it amounts to a rehearsal for the kind of logistical demands — such as loading aircraft — that must be met in wartime.
""In terms of readiness, it's actually, I believe, so far improving our readiness for deployments,"" he said.
Mattis said the mission, which does not include performing law enforcement tasks, was reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers and deemed a legal undertaking. ""It's obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,"" he said.","defense secretary jim mattis defended the use of active duty troops on the u. s. - mexican border, saying that in some ways it provides good training for war. he argued that it's analogous to a 1916 deployment to counter the mexican revolutionary gen. francisco "" pancho "" villa. speaking to reporters wednesday on his way to visit u. s. troops along the border in south texas, mattis declined to provide an estimate of how much the mission will cost. he said cost figures he has received thus far are "" not anywhere near right.

FoxNews,"California is likely to sue President Trump over his emergency declaration to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, the state attorney general said Friday.
Attorney General Xavier Becerra and Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, told reporters there is no emergency at the border and Trump doesn't have the authority to make the declaration.
""No one in America is above the law, not even the president of the United States,"" Becerra said. ""The president does not have power to act frivolously.""
TRUMP SCOLDS OutletName'S ACOSTA AS ANGEL MOMS CONFRONT REPORT OVER 'AGENDA'
Trump declared a national emergency earlier in the day to bypass Congress to use money from the Pentagon and counterdrug efforts to fulfill his promise of completing the border wall. The president said immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were invading the country.
TRUMP DECLARES EMERGENCY AT BORDER
The announcement was immediately met with resistance from members of Congress. Becerra and Newsom said they were reviewing the emergency declaration but were likely to join other states in suing. They did not say when the state plans to file a lawsuit or what specific legal arguments it will use.
But both challenge the notion that there was a true emergency. Becerra said past presidents used such declarations after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the Iran hostage crisis in 1979.
Becerra pointed to Trump's comments earlier in the day that he did not need to issue the emergency declaration but was doing so to accelerate plans for his border wall. He suggested Trump hopes any legal challenges will ultimately be determined by the U.S. Supreme Court. Five of the court's 9 members were appointed by Republican presidents.
""He knows he will lose in court and that he is hoping to use the U.S. Supreme Court as a tool in his game to fulfill a campaign promise,"" Becerra said.
Newsom argued Trump's plan to use money on the border wall that had been dedicated for military installations and combating drugs would hurt California.
Newsom on Monday signed an executive order to pull most of California's 360 National Guard troops from the Southern border but said 100 will remain there to help federal officials combating transnational drug crime.
""Interdiction policies we are engaged in that we want to advance in California now are being put at risk because of this political crisis that's being manufactured,"" Newsom said.
Building a wall, he argued, will not stop the flow of illegal drugs that come across ports of entry in vehicles or by other means.
Becerra has filed at least 45 lawsuits against the Trump administration.","california is likely to sue president trump over his emergency declaration to fund a wall on the u. s. - mexico border, the state attorney general said friday. attorney general xavier becerra and gov. gavin newsom, both democrats, told reporters there is no emergency at the border and trump doesn't have the authority to make the declaration.

HuffPost,"Donald Trump this past Tuesday held a bipartisan meeting in the White House to discuss immigration reform. To clarify, this was before he wondered out loud on Thursday, at another White House meeting, why America had to take people from “shithole countries” like Haiti and those in Africa, and why we couldn’t have more Norwegians instead—we’ll get back to the connection between what he said at the Tuesday meeting and those vile, racist remarks in a bit.
At the Tuesday meeting, Trump made a statement in support of passing comprehensive immigration reform. Now, if he actually understood what that meant, this would have demonstrated some significant political courage. His level of understanding of the issue is, to put it mildly, open to question, as evidenced by the Trump-whispering role Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) had to play during the meeting whenever the titular leader of the free world got his own position on immigration wrong. So, here’s the aforementioned statement:
“If you want to take it that further step, I’ll take the heat, I don’t care,” Trump told lawmakers about a broad immigration bill. “You are not that far away from comprehensive immigration reform. And if you wanted to go that final step, I think you should do it.”
It was a nice sentiment. It reminded me of when Ferris Bueller’s best friend Cameron Frye destroyed his father’s classic car (a 1961 Ferrari 250GT SWB California Spider), and Ferris offered to “take the heat for it.” Cameron, finally showing some backbone to the man who had intimidated him for years, replied: “No, I’ll take it.” Was this a Cameron Frye moment for Donald Trump? Would he actually be willing to risk angering his nativist, racist base by supporting a long-term solution to the immensely complex immigration issue? Would he be able to succeed where George W. Bush and Barack Obama were unable to?
If Trump intends the answer to that question to be yes, he’s got a funny way of showing it, and not funny like how John Hughes movies are funny. At first, he reacted positively on Thursday morning to Senators Richard Durbin (D-IL) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) when they presented a compromise on immigration negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators, but then dumped on it when they met at the White House that afternoon, the same meeting where he made the “shithole” remark:
The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded, Chain & Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime..... — Donald J. Trump () January 12, 2018
The reactions from right-wing media voices like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh—each of whom laid down the law in a different way—tell me that the chances of Mr. 46 Percent of the Popular Vote ever supporting comprehensive immigration reform are about as likely as the chances he’ll release his tax returns.
On Coulter, Jeet Heer at the New Republic described her relationship with Trump thusly: “Trump has had no bigger media boaster, not even the lick-spittling Sean Hannity, than Coulter.” Bearing that in mind, here’s what she had to say about Trump’s supportive remarks on Tuesday about immigration reform:
Trump, flanked by Dems & open-borders GOPS, announces plan for 100% open-ended amnesty (per courts). — Ann Coulter () January 9, 2018
But don't worry! There will be ""border security""! (Political euphemism for: You're not getting wall.) ://t.co/5paiyn2iZv — Ann Coulter () January 9, 2018
This DACA lovefest confirms a main thesis of Michael Wolff's book: When Bannon left. liberal Dems Jared, Ivanka, Cohn & Goldman Sachs took over. — Ann Coulter () January 9, 2018
Nothing Michael Wolff could say about  has hurt him as much as the DACA lovefest right now. — Ann Coulter () January 9, 2018
As he considers the utility of walls (and promises),  should consider that ""Never Trump"" was toothless, but ""Former Trump"" will bite. — Ann Coulter () January 10, 2018
Amnesty is the word that signifies surrender. Amnesty makes a politician dead to the nativist right. Another right-wing bigwig, Mark Levin, used that word as well this week and added that Trump’s remarks amounted to “complete surrender.” To return to Coulter, she had previously noted in her book In Trump We Trust: “There’s nothing Trump can do that won’t be forgiven. Except change his immigration policies.” In other words, if you want to keep your base, don’t do it, Donnie.
You’ll also notice Coulter’s reference to Michael Wolff. Rush Limbaugh’s reaction to Trump’s statement on immigration reform put Wolff and his Fire and Fury book front and center:
I think the meeting about immigration was the thing, not immigration. I think this was a calculated move. It was a brilliantly conceived and flawlessly executed rebuttal to this stupid Wolff book. The pictures tell the tale. Trump is in the room dominating it, controlling it. He is cooperative. He is open. He’s tolerant. He’s understanding. He’s in total command of over 45 minutes of televised meeting on immigration. He is totally informed on the issues. He’s going back and forth with the Democrats on whatever mundane aspect of it they bring up. He is in total command of his position on this. [snip] So after you watch this, how would you react to anything in the Wolff book characterizing Trump as just the opposite of this? And this was the purpose of this today.
Leaving Limbaugh’s lies about Trump’s command of the issue aside for a moment, we see him talking to the nativist base about Trump, whereas Coulter spoke for them to Trump. As the segment drew to a close, Limbaugh took the nativists by the hand, patted them on the head, and told them everything would be all white—I mean alright:
Just look at it this way, folks, if you’re nervous. What happened today really had nothing to do with immigration. He didn’t say anything today that he can’t walk back. He didn’t say anything today that he’s gonna have to walk back, either.
Between Coulter telling Trump to get back in his little box, and Limbaugh reassuring his listeners that he wouldn’t actually be leaving that box, the message was clear enough: Trump had better not betray his base. And really, how could he, given that his racist message on immigration is what he started his campaign with, and it’s what truly differentiated him from the rest of the Republican field in 2015 and 2016.
Either way, Trump this week needed to deal with real anger on the right (seen in what Coulter said) and fear on the right (demonstrated by what Limbaugh needed to say). What better way to deal with this than to remind his base that he thinks just like they do? Hence, the “shithole” remarks. Denying he said them is only for public relations purposes—in private he bragged about it. But the real Trumpers know better, and they are the ones he was talking to. Don’t believe me? Here’s what Trump’s own people inside the White House had to say:
Staffers inside the White House aren't that worried about Trump's ""shithole"" remark -- with some predicting it will actually resonate with his base, not alienate it, much like his attacks on NFL players who kneel during the national anthem did. — Kaitlan Collins () January 11, 2018

Trump knew exactly what he was doing. He made a strategic decision to use racist language about Haitians and Africans as a dog whistle to reassure his racist base. He and his advisers seem to believe it will work. White nationalist Richard Spencer and the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer loved the remark as well, with the latter triumphantly proclaiming: “This is encouraging and refreshing, as it indicates Trump is more or less on the same page as us with regards to race and immigration.” Ann Coulter herself said that the “shithole” line was a direct attempt to “win [her] back,” and showed her support in the following tweet, which speaks for itself in terms of moral value:
Okay, yes -- Trump shouldn't call them ""shithole countries."" A little respect is in order. They are shithole nations. — Ann Coulter () January 11, 2018
Other right-wingers—in the media and in Congress (did you expect any less from Rep. Steve King (R-IA)—also defended the “shithole” remarks, although some other Republican elected officials did actually condemn them. In particular, Lindsey Graham showed some real principle and backbone by telling Trump to his face, right after he made the comments, that they were unacceptable. Graham added: “America is an idea, not a race,” and pointed out to Trump that the Senator’s own ancestors had come from “shithole countries with no skills.” This righteous act does not undo or mitigate what Graham, in concert with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), did in the matter of the Steele dossier a week earlier, or his general support of Trump and Trumpism—something that represents a 180 degree turn from the opinion of Trump he expressed during the presidential campaign. Nevertheless, it’s important to note when a Republican does something worthy of praise.
Two other Senators who had also attended the Thursday White House meeting failed to meet the bar Graham set. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and David Perdue (R-GA) stated afterward that they “do not recall the President saying these comments specifically,” and then went on to defend Trump in general on immigration. However, not even that mealy-mouthed support of Trump’s false denial sufficed for those who desire the Orange Julius Caesar Seal of Approval,TM because Sunday morning both Cotton and Perdue stated unequivocally that their Dear Leader did not make the “shithole” remark.
And, as if that wasn’t enough, Cotton was unable to resist adding that Durbin—who had vociferously denounced the remark—“has a history of misrepresenting what happens in White House meetings.” Although they didn’t mention Graham’s name, they essentially branded him a liar as well. Finally, under the category of always meeting low expectations, we have OutletName’ Jesse Watters, who offered this nugget of wisdom: “this is how the forgotten men and women in America talk at the bar.” This is what Trump has made of Republican politics here in good old 2018.
Forrest Gump said, “I’m not a smart man, but I know what love is.” Donald Trump wouldn’t admit to this, but although he is not a smart man, he knows what hate is. After Trump heard from Limbaugh and Coulter, he spewed forth words from his shithole that demonstrated exactly that.","donald trump this past tuesday held a bipartisan meeting in the white house to discuss immigration reform. to clarify, this was before he wondered out loud on thursday, at another white house meeting, why america had to take people from “ shithole countries ” like haiti and those in africa, and why we couldn ’ t have more norwegians instead — we ’ ll get back to the connection between what he said at the tuesday meeting and those vile, racist remarks in a bit. at the tuesday meeting, trump made a statement in support of passing comprehensive immigration reform. now, if he actually understood what that meant, this would have demonstrated some significant political courage. his level of understanding of the issue is, to put it mildly, open to question, as evidenced by the trump - whispering role rep. kevin mccarthy ( r - ca ) had to play during the meeting whenever the titular leader of the free world got his own position on immigration wrong. so, here ’ s the aforementioned statement : “ if you want to take it that further step, i ’ ll take the heat, i don ’ t care, ” trump told lawmakers about a broad immigration bill. “ you are not that far away from comprehensive immigration reform. and if you wanted to go that final step, i think you should do it. ” it was a nice sentiment. it reminded me of when ferris bueller ’ s best friend cameron frye destroyed his father ’ s classic car ( a 1961 ferrari 250gt swb california spider ), and ferris offered to “ take the heat for it. ” cameron, finally showing some backbone to the man who had intimidated him for years, replied : “ no, i ’ ll take it. ” was this a cameron frye moment for donald trump? would he actually be willing to risk angering his nativist, racist base by supporting a long - term solution to the immensely complex immigration issue? would he be able to succeed where george w. bush and barack obama were unable to? if trump intends the answer to that question to be yes, he ’ s got a funny way of showing it, and not funny like how john hughes movies are funny. at first, he reacted positively on thursday morning to senators richard durbin ( d - il ) and lindsey graham ( r - sc ) when they presented a compromise on immigration negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators, but then dumped on it when they met at the white house that afternoon, the same meeting where he made the “ shithole ” remark : the so - called bi",0.999977231025695,0.499977263800247,1,414,0.72,1.93,4.83,1.21,0.97,2.66,9.9,3.38,1.69,1.45,1.93,0.72,2.42,0.97,0.24,0.0,0.24,0.0,14.98,0.24,0.48,0.0,3.62,0.48,0.72,2.66,0.0,0.24,1.21,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.48,0.0,0.24,0.24,8.7,1.21,5.31,1.45,0.48,0.48,5.07,5.8,0.97,0.0,4.3478260869565215,13.043478260869565,1.2077294685990339
CNN,"The San Antonio, Texas, police chief's decision to release a dozen undocumented immigrants discovered in a tractor trailer has spurred demands by the local police association that the chief be put on leave while his actions are investigated.
At least one expert, however, says that though there are unusual aspects to the case, it doesn't appear Chief Bill McManus did anything inappropriate by releasing the immigrants to the local Catholic Charities last month.
""He did nothing unlawful under federal law or state law,"" said Denise Gilman, a University of Texas law professor and co-director of the law school's Immigration Clinic.
It is the second-such incident in fewer than six months. In July, police arrived at a Walmart parking lot to find dozens of immigrants in a trailer . Eight were dead; two more died later. Driver James Bradley Jr., 61, pleaded guilty to two federal charges and now faces possible life in prison in that case.
In last month's case, none of the immigrants was injured. Police have charged the 58-year-old tractor driver from Houston with smuggling of persons. A woman, who McManus has reportedly classified as a driver, also was charged.
The decision to bring state charges -- rather than federal offenses -- has prompted criticism. A local police officers group says McManus deviated from normal procedures and told a federal officer he wasn't needed at the scene; the chief has said the city may have faced legal liability if it held the truck occupants.
McManus declined OutletName's requests for an interview, but his department released a statement saying, ""To clarify, Homeland Security was never told that their services were not needed. SAPD handled this investigation utilizing the state smuggling statute. Unfortunately, this is the second incident in the last year. Fortunately, this time citizen interaction and a quick police response prevented another tragedy.""
Victims or parties to the crime?
McManus has referred to the 12 immigrants as victims -- and said he treated them accordingly -- but Michael Helle, president of the San Antonio Police Officers Association, contends they were not victims, but ""a party to the offense committed.""
In a Monday letter to Mayor Ron Nirenberg and the City Council, Helle demands to know why the immigrants were not identified, why the Houston man is being prosecuted on a state charge rather than a more serious federal offense and why McManus did not let Homeland Security Investigations, a component of US Immigration Customs Enforcement, handle the case.
Helle wants McManus placed on administrative leave until an outside investigation can determine whether the chief broke any laws, ""in addition to the obvious violations of the general (police) manual,"" he wrote in his letter.
McManus has defended his handling of the case, saying at a news conference last week, ""Once the folks got here to police headquarters, we have no jurisdiction to hold them, to detain them, so they were released to Catholic Charities.""
He continued, ""Based on the information that I had on the scene and the situation at the scene, the number of police officers that we had standing around, the number of people who were lined up on the curb, that was absolutely, in my mind, the right decision at the time,"" he said.
'There's no authority to detain them'
Police Chief Bill McManus addresses reporters during a news conference last week.
The University of Texas' Gilman said that, based on her understanding of the case, the chief is correct.
""It's absolutely common that victims of crime, even if they're undocumented immigrants, would be released,"" she said. ""There's no authority to detain them.""
Things might have been different had a federal agency requested local police detain the immigrants, but there's no indication that's the case, she said.
US Customs and Immigration Services officials in Texas did not return OutletName's calls seeking to determine whether the feds requested they be detained. San Antonio police, too, declined to return emails on the matter, despite providing other information on the case.
In a statement to OutletName affiliate KSAT , McManus said it was his prerogative to handle the case under the state's anti-smuggling law and denied assertions he ordered anyone to disregard protocol. He said fingerprinting or running background checks on the 12 immigrants would have violated department procedure and may have resulted in a lawsuit against the city.
""SAPD had no legal authority to hold the 12 individuals after they were questioned; the City may have faced legal liability if SAPD had done so,"" he said in his statement to the station.
Gilman concurred with this statement.
As for the Homeland Security Investigations agent who arrived on the scene, McManus said, the agent was provided access to the immigrants at police headquarters and his department never prevented the agent from taking them into custody.
The background
On December 23, one of McManus' officers was conducting a traffic stop when a resident approached him and said there was a trailer near a water park ""with some individuals in it and that two females were right outside crying,"" according to a police report.
The officer followed the resident to the scene, and found the driver ""pacing around,"" the report said. One of the trailer doors was open, and several immigrants were sitting inside the trailer.
The driver told the officer that the trailer was not his, but he owned the tractor. The driver further said he ""might have grabbed the wrong trailer and stated that his dispatcher was trying to figure it out,"" the report said.
Asked about the people in the trailer, the driver said, ""Oh, they were going to help me move the stuff,"" according to the police report.
The officer asked one of the people in the trailer where he was traveling from, and the man replied Guatemala. He had been picked up ""somewhere in the woods,"" he said, according to the report.
The officer contacted Homeland Security Investigations, but when McManus arrived on the scene, he requested that his detectives handle the call, the report said.
Where did they go?
At police headquarters, the report stated, the driver told police he had picked up the immigrants at a warehouse 160 miles away in Laredo, on the Mexican border, and driven them to San Antonio, where they were scheduled to be picked up.
""All witnesses stated that they were all placed in the trailer, picked up in Laredo, TX and transported to San Antonio, TX. All witnesses were released,"" the report said.
Where the immigrants are now is unclear. McManus says he doesn't know what happened to them after he handed them over to the charity group.
Antonio Fernandez, local president of Catholic Charities, was out of the office Tuesday and could not be reached via email.
But in an interview with Texas Public Radio , he said that five of the migrants declined his organization's assistance, and his staff took the other seven to a hotel.
Five left the hotel December 24, and two left Christmas Day, headed to Tennessee, he told the station.
""If it happens again and we are being called -- unless I'm being told legally that I cannot do it -- I will be helping everybody regardless,"" he said.
Smuggling or trafficking?
Helle said in his City Council letter that by referring to the immigrants as victims, McManus is confusing the crimes of human trafficking and human smuggling.
Where trafficking has victims -- such as people forced or coerced to perform labor or commercial sex acts -- those involved in human smuggling are party to the crime, he wrote.
""Human smuggling is defined as the importation of people into the United States involving deliberate evasion of immigration. ... Human trafficking and human smuggling are not interchangeable terms,"" he wrote.
Helle also said, ""Never in my 28-year tenure working for the San Antonio Police Department have we witnessed such actions, taken by a chief, as were done on Dec. 23.""
Bexar County District Attorney Nico LaHood conceded the move was unusual and said during a news conference last week that San Antonio police have not brought his office a transport smuggling case since he took office three years ago. The July incident is being federally prosecuted.
""It's a state smuggling charge, trafficking charge,"" he said. ""We're working with our federal partners. There's people that might have information about other cases, so we're going to go through our reviewing process and work with whoever we think has information that will help us.""
Texas is embroiled in a legal fight over its Senate Bill 4, which demands local police and governments comply with immigration laws and federal detention requests. Civil rights groups have called the bill an assault on so-called ""sanctuary cities.""
Gov. Greg Abbott signed the bill last year after Travis County passed a law restricting law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials. He also cut the county off from $1.5 million in criminal justice defense grants.
A panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit allowed Texas to enforce key provisions of the bill until a final ruling is made. Attorney General Ken Paxton promised in October to continue his defense of SB4.
""Senate Bill 4 is a common sense measure that prevents governments in Texas from standing in the way of federal enforcement of immigration law,"" he said.","the san antonio, texas, police chief's decision to release a dozen undocumented immigrants discovered in a tractor trailer has spurred demands by the local police association that the chief be put on leave while his actions are investigated. at least one expert, however, says that though there are unusual aspects to the case, it doesn't appear chief bill mcmanus did anything inappropriate by releasing the immigrants to the local catholic charities last month.

Breitbart,"Prominent leaders of the Democratic Party once fiercely endorsed border security, and had even voted to secure a border fence along the nation’s southern border.
These stringent calls for tougher border policy appear to have ceased since Donald Trump took office as President of the United States.
In 2006, Senate Democrats — including then-senators Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, and Joe Biden — voted to secure a fence along the United States southern border. Check out the instances in which prominent leaders of the Democratic Party championed the border fence and stronger border security overall.
1. Barack Obama
“The bill before us will certainly do some good,” said then-Senator Obama in 2006, adding that the Secure Fence Act would provide “better fences and better security” and that it would make headway against “the tide of illegal immigration in this country.”
“Real reform means stronger border security,” said Obama several years later as president, during his 2013 State Of The Union.
“Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost one trillion dollars in the next two decades,” said Obama during his 2014 State Of The Union, bringing up his alleged concern about stopping illegal immigration once again.
2. Hillary Clinton
“Look, I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in, and I do think you have to control your borders,” said Clinton, referring to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, “We need to secure our borders, I’m for it, I voted for it, I believe in it.”
3. Bill Clinton
A decade earlier, Hillary Clinton’s husband and then-president Bill Clinton affirmed his own beliefs that illegal immigration should be stopped in his 1995 State Of The Union, stating that “all Americans” were right to be “disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering [the United States],” adding that illegal aliens “impose burdens on [U.S.] taxpayers.”
4. Chuck Schumer
Schumer, who also voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act, elaborated on his pro-border security stance a few years later in a speech at the Georgetown University Law Center, in which the senator told his audience that referring to illegal aliens as “undocumented” is unacceptable.
“Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple,” said Schumer, “When we use phrases like ‘undocumented workers,’ we convey a message to the American people that their government is not serious about combatting illegal immigration, which the American people overwhelmingly oppose.”
“If you don’t think it’s illegal, you’re not going to say it. I think it is illegal, and wrong, and we have to change it,” added the senator.
5. Dianne Feinstein
“Democrats are solidly behind controlling the border, and we support the border fence,” said Feinstein of the Secure Fence Act of 2006.
6. Nancy Pelosi
In 2013, then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi referred to border security as a “basic principle,” and urged congress to support legislation that she claimed would secure the U.S. border.
7. Vice President Joe Biden
“We [President Obama and I] felt so strongly, from the day we took office, for the need for immigration reform,” said Vice President Biden in 2014, who had also voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act when he was a senator.
Biden continued, by criticizing those who choose to enter a foreign country illegally:
“Imagine — you say, ‘I got a good idea, let’s gather up everything we have, sell it, give it to some coyotes to take us to a country that doesn’t want us, drop us off in God knows where, we don’t [know] anybody, we leave everything that’s familiar to us. Let’s go, isn’t that going to be a great idea?’ These are horrible decisions these people are making.”

Breitbart,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s top diplomat said Monday his country will spend about $50 million to hire lawyers for migrants in the United States facing deportation.
The money will be channeled through Mexican consulates in the U.S. and also go to outreach programs “to promote respect for Mexicans’ rights.”
Foreign Relations Secretary Luis Videgaray said the effort “isn’t about obstructing the enforcement of the law in the United States, or much less opposing law enforcement.”
“We are going to focus the money on one fundamental objective, which is the defense of the rights of Mexicans. This means legal advice, informational campaigns, the hiring of lawyers where it is necessary.”
Videgaray also says Mexico understands “it will be necessary to make some changes” to the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. and Canada. U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to re-negotiate NAFTA.
But he said Monday that Mexico won’t accept a return to protectionist policies such as import quotas or tariffs.
He mentioned including things such as e-commerce, which didn’t exist when NAFTA took effect in 1994. Videgaray did not specify what other changes Mexico would be open to, but did say the country wanted “integrated negotiations, where all topics will be discussed and the dialogue won’t be limited to commercial aspects, for example, but also include issues like immigration and security.”
Along with renegotiating NAFTA, Trump has pledged to increase the deportations of people who are in the United States illegally, positions that have caused major frictions with Mexico.
Videgaray said Mexico wants to diversify its trade. At present, about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports go to the United States.
He said Mexico wants to improve trade with Latin American countries, Japan and especially South Korea.
Mexico also wants to negotiate free trade agreements with Brazil and Argentina and attract foreign investment from China, the foreign relations secretary said.","mexico city ( ap ) — mexico ’ s top diplomat said monday his country will spend about $ 50 million to hire lawyers for migrants in the united states facing deportation. the money will be channeled through mexican consulates in the u. s. and also go to outreach programs “ to promote respect for mexicans ’ rights. ” foreign relations secretary luis videgaray said the effort “ isn ’ t about obstructing the enforcement of the law in the united states, or much less opposing law enforcement. ” “ we are going to focus the money on one fundamental objective, which is the defense of the rights of mexicans. this means legal advice, informational campaigns, the hiring of lawyers where it is necessary. ” videgaray also says mexico understands “ it will be necessary to make some changes ” to the north american free trade agreement with the u. s. and canada. u. s. president donald trump has pledged to re - negotiate nafta. but he said monday that mexico won ’ t accept a return to protectionist policies such as import quotas or tariffs. he mentioned including things such as e - commerce, which didn ’ t exist when nafta took effect in 1994. videgaray did not specify what other changes mexico would be open to, but did say the country wanted “ integrated negotiations, where all topics will be discussed and the dialogue won ’ t be limited to commercial aspects, for example, but also include issues like immigration and security. ” along with renegotiating nafta, trump has pledged to increase the deportations of people who are in the united states illegally, positions that have caused major frictions with mexico. videgaray said mexico wants to diversify its trade. at present, about 80 percent of mexico ’ s exports go to the united states. he said mexico wants to improve trade with latin american countries, japan and especially south korea. mexico also wants to negotiate free trade agreements with brazil and argentina and attract foreign investment from china, the foreign relations secretary said.",0.0150314467027783,0.484968602657318,0,322,1.55,3.11,8.07,0.93,1.55,5.59,7.14,0.93,1.55,1.55,0.62,0.0,3.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.24,0.0,0.0,5.28,2.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.62,0.62,5.9,0.93,5.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.17,4.97,4.66,2.8,6.521739130434782,8.385093167701864,0.9316770186335404
Daily Caller,"President Donald Trump has often noted that America’s rich and powerful choose to live behind large walls for protection, much like the wall he is trying to build across the U.S.-Mexico border.
Nowhere has that thesis proven truer than in the posh neighborhoods of Los Angeles and Hollywood. The homes of the rich and famous, peppered throughout the area, are often gated and feature high walls that protect the homes from outsiders.
But what about the viscerally anti-Trump celebrities that reside in Hollywood and hate the idea of Trump’s border wall? Do these moguls, sports and film celebrities really live behind walls? OutletName set out to find the truth in a series called “Walls Across America.”
Celebrities like Jimmy Kimmel, Chelsea Handler, Jim Carrey, Barbara Streisand, Rob Reiner and Mark Hamill have used their massive celebrity platforms to advocate harshly against Trump’s immigration policies.
So how do these rich progressive celebrities choose to protect the things they love? We investigated.
In a recent Oval Office address to the nation, President Trump said, “Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences and gates around their homes?” “They don’t build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside,” the president claimed. “The only thing that is immoral is the politicians who do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.”

HuffPost,"President Donald Trump addressed the nation live from the Oval Office on Tuesday night in an attempt to drum up support for his border wall. But the 10-minute address, carried on every major television network in America, was rife with double-speak, cherry-picked statistics and outright falsehoods.
Take a look at some of the biggest lies from the president’s speech below.
That Mexico will pay for the wall indirectly.
“The wall will always be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.”
After abandoning his campaign pledge that Mexico would directly pay for a barrier along the southern border, Trump has instead insisted in recent months that the country would do so indirectly through a revised North American Free Trade Agreement.
However, both economists and trade experts have said that won’t be the case. First, the revised trade deal hasn’t been approved by Congress yet, and any economic benefits would simply come from lower tariffs or increased wages for Americans. Those benefits will be dwarfed by the actual cost of the wall, many outside experts say, and it’ll be American taxpayers who will ultimately pay for the massive structure if it goes forward.
That drugs are pouring across the border.
“Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl.”
More than 90 percent of heroin sold in the United States does come from Mexico, but almost all of it is transported through legal ports of entry. Only a “small percentage of all heroin seized by CBP along the land border was between Ports of Entry,” the Drug Enforcement Administration said in a report last year.
Fentanyl, a major narcotic that has led to a spate of drug overdoses, mainly comes into the United States through packages mailed from China and has been difficult for border agents to detect, according to OutletName.
Trump also said illicit drugs cost the U.S. some $500 billion annually, but a surgeon general report in 2015 estimated that toll at around a third of the president’s figure, or $193 billion.
That children are being used as pawns.
“Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.”
Customs and Border Protection reported in November that a little more than 20,000 “family units” were captured at the southern border. But only a small percentage of these family units have been determined to be a ploy in an attempt to sneak over the border, according to an analysis by The Washington Post.
The majority of migrant children are accompanied by their parents or other relatives.
That Democrats are stonewalling efforts to end the partial government shutdown.
“Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.” “The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.”
Trump accused Democrats in Congress of holding up the government shutdown by stonewalling negotiations on border security. In fact, Democrats offered to allocate $1.3 billion in the budget for border security, which included building and refurbishing barriers at the border.
During a meeting with Trump in December, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) agreed with the president that the country needed border security. They also asked Trump if he would be willing to budge from his $5.7 billion request.
In that same meeting, Trump maintained that he would keep the government shutdown going if he didn’t get what he wanted, contradicting Tuesday night’s address where he solely blamed Democrats for the shutdown.
“Yes, if we don’t get what we want, one way or the other — whether it’s through you, through a military, through anything you want to call — I will shut down the government. Absolutely,” Trump said in December.
He added: “I am proud to shut down the government for border security.”
That Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer supported a border wall in the past.
“Sen. Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats,” Trump said. “They changed their mind only after I was elected president.”
Schumer did previously support a bill that allowed for the construction of a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border, but that fence pales in comparison to the “big, beautiful” 30-foot concrete wall that Trump promised his supporters.
In 2006, Schumer, along with then-Sens. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and 22 other Democrats, voted for the Secure Fence Act, which authorized a fence to be built along 700 miles of the border and included short vehicle barriers and additional surveillance.
Trump’s plans for his border wall vary over time and are vague, but here’s what we do know: According to a 2017 executive order, it would be an “impassable physical barrier,” which Trump first proclaimed would be made of concrete before switching to “steel slats.” He’s also said the wall had to be 30 feet or higher.
As Trump pointed out himself while campaigning for president in 2015, his border wall would be nothing like a fence.
“It’s not a fence,” Trump said in a tweet addressed to Jeb Bush. “It’s a WALL, and there’s a BIG difference!”
That the immigrants that ICE has arrested are extremely violent and dangerous.
“In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.”
The statistics that Trump uses are mostly accurate, though he frames it in a way to make immigrants crossing the border more dangerous than they actually are.
According to ICE’s year-end report, the agency arrested 210,876 people with previous criminal convictions and 55,233 people with pending charges ― but the criminal convictions include such non-violent offenses as DUIs and other traffic violations.
The second set of numbers he provides are based on specific charges and convictions. As the Washington Post’s Salvador Rizzo pointed out, “In many cases, the people arrested face multiple counts, so that switch [to focusing on charges and convictions] gives a confusing picture.”
That Democrats support a steel barrier along the border with Mexico.
“At the request of Democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.”
The reality: Democrats don’t want a wall. Period. They do, however, want an end to the shutdown.
“The fact is: We all agree that we need to secure our borders, while honoring our values,” Pelosi said in the Democrats’ rebuttal speech. “We can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry; we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation; we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border; and we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.”","president donald trump addressed the nation live from the oval office on tuesday night in an attempt to drum up support for his border wall. but the 10 - minute address, carried on every major television network in america, was rife with double - speak, cherry - picked statistics and outright falsehoods. take a look at some of the biggest lies from the president ’ s speech below. that mexico will pay for the wall indirectly. “ the wall will always be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with mexico. ” after abandoning his campaign pledge that mexico would directly pay for a barrier along the southern border, trump has instead insisted in recent months that the country would do so indirectly through a revised north american free trade agreement. however, both economists and trade experts have said that won ’ t be the case. first, the revised trade deal hasn ’ t been approved by congress yet, and any economic benefits would simply come from lower tariffs or increased wages for americans. those benefits will be dwarfed by the actual cost of the wall, many outside experts say, and it ’ ll be american taxpayers who will ultimately pay for the massive structure if it goes forward. that drugs are pouring across the border. “ our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. ” more than 90 percent of heroin sold in the united states does come from mexico, but almost all of it is transported through legal ports of entry. only a “ small percentage of all heroin seized by cbp along the land border was between ports of entry, ” the drug enforcement administration said in a report last year. fentanyl, a major narcotic that has led to a spate of drug overdoses, mainly comes into the united states through packages mailed from china and has been difficult for border agents to detect, according to outletname. trump also said illicit drugs cost the u. s. some $ 500 billion annually, but a surgeon general report in 2015 estimated that toll at around a third of the president ’ s figure, or $ 193 billion. that children are being used as pawns. “ last month, 20, 000 migrant children were illegally brought into the united states, a dramatic increase. these children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. ” customs and border protection reported in november that a little more than 20, 000 “ family units ” were captured at the southern border. but only a small percentage of these family units have been determined to",0.999979615211486,0.499979601861924,1,428,3.27,9.11,5.14,1.4,0.7,3.5,7.01,0.23,0.93,0.93,2.34,0.23,2.57,0.0,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.94,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.47,0.23,0.0,3.74,3.27,0.0,4.21,1.87,0.0,0.0,0.23,0.0,0.7,0.23,11.92,1.87,10.05,0.47,0.0,0.0,3.74,5.84,2.57,0.93,5.373831775700935,9.345794392523365,1.4018691588785046
CNN,"House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi was hot with anger Friday over the status of the American immigration system and Republican proposals to change it. Pelosi’s contempt for President Donald Trump’s immigration policy erupted outside the sun-baked Capitol after the President announced earlier in the morning that the Republican compromise bill brokered by House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Trumps’ own advisers, was not tough enough for Trump to sign. “The legislation … is totally unworthy of America,” Pelosi said, speaking on the sixth anniversary of the implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. She added, “It’s a bad bill to begin with. So when the President says he’s not going to sign it, it just goes to show you how low his standards are.” The new legislation to be taken up by the House next week was billed Thursday, by Ryan and other GOP lawmakers, as an opportunity to broker a deal to allow some DACA recipients legal status that could be used to eventually enable a path to citizenship, while providing tougher border security, and an end to Trump’s fairly recent controversial policy that has led to the separation of incoming immigrant children from their parents at the border. Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited the Bible on Thursday, specifically Romans 13 – a call to obey the law, as a moral justification for detaining children and parents separately who enter the US without permission, a position White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended. Pelosi decried the administration’s argument as hypocritical. “For this administration to pose as people of faith, and pose as people who care about family and children, is a height of hypocrisy that knows no bounds,” Pelosi said. Pelosi cited former Republican presidents who she said were “right thinking” and “good thinking” such as Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, whom she said would not support such a policy. She urged “Republicans who respect the dignity and worth of people” to “reject the un-American activities that’s being put forth by the President of the United States, by the Republicans in Congress and by this attorney general.” Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairwoman Michelle Lujan Grisham, a New Mexico Democrat, said the biblical defense “shows a dysfunctional, chaotic White House administration and Republican conference … no policy defenses to their current action separating families and taking children away from their mothers and fathers at the border.” Grisham continued that “it just is another indication they cannot govern.” Pelosi said Trump’s and his administration’s actions on immigration are “all political.” “The President is throwing red meat to his base when he does that,” she said. “He’s using children, whether they’re (DACA recipients) or whether they’re little children at the border now, for a political purpose. It’s shameful.” Rep. Yvette Clarke, a New York Democrat and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, warned the administration about using the Bible to defend their policy . “The Bible centuries ago was used as a justification for the slavery of people of African descent in this nation,” Clarke said. “So for them to invoke that, their justification for separating families, I would just say that as a Christian, I’ve read that we are to welcome the stranger and unfortunately this is not something this administration wants to adhere to.”","house democratic leader nancy pelosi was hot with anger friday over the status of the american immigration system and republican proposals to change it. pelosi ’ s contempt for president donald trump ’ s immigration policy erupted outside the sun - baked capitol after the president announced earlier in the morning that the republican compromise bill brokered by house speaker paul ryan, and trumps ’ own advisers, was not tough enough for trump to sign. “ the legislation … is totally unworthy of america, ” pelosi said, speaking on the sixth anniversary of the implementation of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program. she added, “ it ’ s a bad bill to begin with. so when the president says he ’ s not going to sign it, it just goes to show you how low his standards are. ” the new legislation to be taken up by the house next week was billed thursday, by ryan and other gop lawmakers, as an opportunity to broker a deal to allow some daca recipients legal status that could be used to eventually enable a path to citizenship, while providing tougher border security, and an end to trump ’ s fairly recent controversial policy that has led to the separation of incoming immigrant children from their parents at the border. attorney general jeff sessions cited the bible on thursday, specifically romans 13 – a call to obey the law, as a moral justification for detaining children and parents separately who enter the us without permission, a position white house press secretary sarah sanders defended. pelosi decried the administration ’ s argument as hypocritical. “ for this administration to pose as people of faith, and pose as people who care about family and children, is a height of hypocrisy that knows no bounds, ” pelosi said. pelosi cited former republican presidents who she said were “ right thinking ” and “ good thinking ” such as ronald reagan, george h. w. bush and george w. bush, whom she said would not support such a policy. she urged “ republicans who respect the dignity and worth of people ” to “ reject the un - american activities that ’ s being put forth by the president of the united states, by the republicans in congress and by this attorney general. ” congressional hispanic caucus chairwoman michelle lujan grisham, a new mexico democrat, said the biblical defense “ shows a dysfunctional, chaotic white house administration and republican conference … no policy defenses to their current action separating families and taking children away from their mothers and fathers at the border. ”",0.999982476234436,0.499982520537742,1,407,0.49,1.72,9.83,0.98,0.25,8.6,6.14,1.23,2.21,0.49,0.25,0.25,2.21,0.25,0.98,0.0,0.74,0.0,15.97,1.47,0.0,1.47,0.74,0.0,1.23,3.69,0.98,0.74,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.25,0.25,6.63,1.72,4.18,0.74,0.0,0.25,5.16,4.18,1.97,0.98,8.5995085995086,8.5995085995086,1.71990171990172
HuffPost,"For a fleeting moment on Thursday, it sounded like there might have been a major breakthrough in Congress to protect Dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children.
Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), one of six senators working on a Dreamer bill, told reporters that the group had agreed on a package that would renew the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration program. But not long after the initial news, the White House and other Republicans rushed to deny any deal had been reached. Negotiations still have “a long ways to go,” White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said Thursday afternoon.
With only eight days until a government shutdown, lawmakers still haven’t come to an agreement even within their own parties on what to do about DACA. Democrats want a legislative solution for Dreamers to be part of any must-pass spending package, and many have said they won’t accept certain trade-offs. Meanwhile, many Republicans are just as strong-headed that they won’t budge without new immigration restrictions.
At a White House meeting on Thursday, President Donald Trump told a bipartisan group of lawmakers to keep working and rejected the proposal from the group of six that Flake is a part of, according to Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who was in the meeting and represents the more restrictionist flank of the party on immigration.
“It’s not even a fig leaf. It’s a pine needle,” Cotton told reporters. He added later, “It’s a joke of a proposal.”
Earlier this week, Trump told lawmakers at the White House that he wants three concessions in exchange for signing protections for Dreamers. First, he wants border security, including his signature wall. Second, he wants an end to the diversity visa lottery, which grants green cards to up to 50,000 people from countries with low immigration levels, after vetting. And finally, Trump wants to end what he calls “chain migration,” a term for allowing Americans and legal permanent residents to sponsor family for green cards beyond spouses and minor children.
The White House hasn’t yet said what it would be willing to agree to for actually helping Dreamers. Short told reporters that it would be narrower than the Dream Act ― a bill to grant legal status to a larger group of young undocumented immigrants than DACA ― but that Trump was open to eventual legal status and citizenship, depending on what he got in return.
The six-senator group’s deal addresses all of the areas the president asked for, according to a statement released on Thursday afternoon by the group, which along with Flake includes Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), and Bob Menendez (D-N.J.). They have not yet released the proposal publicly but said they “are now working to build support for that deal in Congress.”
But the proposal put forward by the group of six in the Senate remains far from what House Republicans are proposing. Lawmakers there have taken Trump’s principles and put forward a bill with even more immigration restrictions, though they say their additional measures are all part of the “border security” plank. The White House issued a statement praising the bill but singling out only its previously-stated policy principles.
Democrats immediately dismissed that House GOP bill, with progressive coalitions in Congress pushing back against Trump’s initial demands, let alone the expanded provisions in the Republican legislation.The Congressional Tri-Caucus ― made up of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus ― has called for a “clean” bill to help Dreamers. If they don’t get help for Dreamers, they’re not going to vote for a funding bill, said Hispanic Caucus member Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.).
Democratic members have suggested they’re willing to negotiate on some issues, but there are lines they won’t cross. Eliminating the diversity visa lottery and family-based visas isn’t something Democrats could support, Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) said, although he added that they might discuss changes to how to administer or lay out the programs.
Some lawmakers have floated ending the diversity visa lottery but giving those visas to people who hold temporary protected status. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said that would amount to pitting “needy people against needy people.”
“That is taking the last crumbs out of the basket, walking into an impoverished community and throwing them on the ground,” Jackson Lee said. “That is unacceptable.”
Rep. Norma Torres (D-Calif.), another member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said if a deal includes ending the diversity visa lottery and ending family-based visa categories, she’d likely oppose it.
“We should not be talking about anything other than fixing [Dreamers’] immigration status,” she said.
If that’s the standard for Democrats on the left, and if Republicans in Congress and the White House are still insisting on items like a wall and an end, in their words, to “chain migration,” it’s difficult to see any quick agreement.
If no deal comes together over the next week, Congress must pass yet another short-term funding extension, their fourth for a fiscal year that began in October.
House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Thursday he planned to put forth another “clean” continuing resolution (CR) next week, with a broader deal already looking unlikely to be finalized in a few legislative days.
But Democrats aren’t sounding all that supportive of another short-term extension, with progressives in the House signaling that delaying this fight even longer isn’t palatable to them. At the end of December, 119 Democrats voted against a CR, and that number could quickly rise next week.
Complicating this legislative discussion is the fact that Congress won’t actually be putting forth a “clean” CR. Sequestration ― the automatic spending cuts that were set in 2011 ― is set to trigger on Jan. 21 absent a deal raising spending caps. When OutletName asked House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) whether conservatives would support raising the caps temporarily in a CR, Meadows said he’d favor suspending sequestration for only defense. “I don’t know that there is an appetite to increase caps without a better understanding of where our appropriations efforts are headed,” he said.
Former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) also told OutletName on Thursday afternoon that he opposed raising non-defense spending caps in a CR as well. “I do not remember the American people electing us to do that,” he said.
When pressed if he was willing to enter a shutdown over the issue, Jordan reiterated that he was fine raising the spending limits for the military, and if Democrats wouldn’t accept increasing the caps for just defense, it would be them shutting down the government and denying troops a pay raise.
Still, barring a mutiny over the caps, Republicans expect they’ll be able to pass a short-term extension in the House and then get the Senate to back the bill allowing for more time. But there’s some uncertainty that Senate Democrats would vote for another CR themselves.
“There are many reasons that I may not support a CR, including I think it’s time that we take care of our Dreamers,” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) told OutletName on Thursday.
When OutletName asked if he thought Democrats were willing to enter into a shutdown over a dispute on a short-term government funding extension, Merkley said the only responsibility for a shutdown would be with Republicans and the administration. “They’re in charge,” he said.
But other Senate Democrats sounded a little more hesitant.
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said he didn’t know whether Jan. 19th ― the day funding is set to expire ― was the line, or if Democrats would extend the deadline. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said it’d be “silly” to shut down the government. And Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said there was no need for a crisis.
It’s unclear, however, how much of that talk downplaying a shutdown is just spin. Democrats say it’d be on Republicans if there was a shutdown.","for a fleeting moment on thursday, it sounded like there might have been a major breakthrough in congress to protect dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the united states as children. sen. jeff flake ( r - ariz. ), one of six senators working on a dreamer bill, told reporters that the group had agreed on a package that would renew the deferred action for childhood arrivals ( daca ) immigration program. but not long after the initial news, the white house and other republicans rushed to deny any deal had been reached. negotiations still have “ a long ways to go, ” white house legislative affairs director marc short said thursday afternoon. with only eight days until a government shutdown, lawmakers still haven ’ t come to an agreement even within their own parties on what to do about daca. democrats want a legislative solution for dreamers to be part of any must - pass spending package, and many have said they won ’ t accept certain trade - offs. meanwhile, many republicans are just as strong - headed that they won ’ t budge without new immigration restrictions. at a white house meeting on thursday, president donald trump told a bipartisan group of lawmakers to keep working and rejected the proposal from the group of six that flake is a part of, according to sen. tom cotton ( r - ark. ), who was in the meeting and represents the more restrictionist flank of the party on immigration. “ it ’ s not even a fig leaf. it ’ s a pine needle, ” cotton told reporters. he added later, “ it ’ s a joke of a proposal. ” earlier this week, trump told lawmakers at the white house that he wants three concessions in exchange for signing protections for dreamers. first, he wants border security, including his signature wall. second, he wants an end to the diversity visa lottery, which grants green cards to up to 50, 000 people from countries with low immigration levels, after vetting. and finally, trump wants to end what he calls “ chain migration, ” a term for allowing americans and legal permanent residents to sponsor family for green cards beyond spouses and minor children. the white house hasn ’ t yet said what it would be willing to agree to for actually helping dreamers. short told reporters that it would be narrower than the dream act ― a bill to grant legal status to a larger group of young undocumented immigrants than daca ― but that trump was open to eventual legal status and citizenship, depending on what he got",0.999965786933898,0.499965751900163,1,414,2.17,5.07,6.76,1.21,1.21,4.35,7.25,0.24,0.48,2.42,1.21,0.24,2.9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.11,0.48,0.0,0.0,1.69,0.72,1.45,3.14,0.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.72,0.97,7.25,1.93,4.35,1.69,0.24,0.0,6.28,5.31,1.69,1.93,7.004830917874397,11.352657004830919,0.4830917874396135

FoxNews,"Being deported to an El Salvador he hadn't seen in more than three decades was a trauma Hugo Castro recalls clearly.
The 51-year-old said Monday that his country must begin preparing now to receive the nearly 200,000 Salvadorans who may have to return following the Trump administration's decision to lift their temporary protected status next year.
""The main problem for deportees is that they're made invisible. They're rejected, there's no work. They don't help us,"" said Castro, who was deported from the U.S. in 2015.
The U.S. announcement brought fears that a major source of income for this poor Central American nation will be cut off and that families could be separated. But there was also a hint of optimism that Salvadorans with many years of experience in the U.S. could bring expertise and investment to spur the economy.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Salvadorans who have stayed in the U.S. with temporary protected status — only a fraction of the estimated 2 million Salvadorans living there — would have to leave by Sept. 9, 2019, unless Congress came up with a solution allowing them to stay.
The temporary protected status program has been offered to citizens from a number of countries fleeing natural disasters or other instability. The affected Salvadorans received the status after earthquakes in 2001 killed more than 1,000 people. Thousands more who arrived in the United States in recent years fleeing gang violence were not eligible.
Castro went to the United States as a teenager to study at a college in Atlanta. During his junior year his family back home lost nearly everything when the bank seized their coffee operation. Dropping out, he worked at a country club and a book store and became manager of a Mexican restaurant. Then a run-in with police led to more than two years in immigration detention as he unsuccessfully fought deportation after living in the U.S. for three decades.
His first three months back in El Salvador were the worst, he said. He suffered from depression and didn't want to leave his mother's home. People told him a 49-year-old man should not depend on his mother to support him, so he started looking for work.
""I went everywhere, to restaurants. I told them I had a lot of experience and that I spoke English, but they rejected me,"" he said.
Eight months after arriving, Castro finally found work at the Salvadoran Immigrant Institute. The non-profit group recognized the value of Castro's bilingualism and the experience he had gained through the deportation process and it put him to work helping other deportees reintegrate into society.
Castro said programs like his are very limited and more needs to be done for returnees.
""The government has to get ready, partner with businesses, with all of society, the nonprofits and create assistance programs,"" he said.
As an example, he noted that in 2016, the country received 52,000 deportees from the United States and Mexico. Meanwhile, a government program to give small cash grants to allow deportees to open their own businesses has only graduated 140 people, he said.
The biggest worry among many Salvadorans is that their nation of 6.2 million people will see a big drop in the amount of cash sent home by countrymen working in the United States. Salvadorans transferred more than $4.5 billion from the U.S. in 2016, accounting for 17 percent of El Salvador's economy, according to government figures.
Luis Membreno, an economic analyst in El Salvador, said that fear may be overblown. He said Salvadorans who have protected status in the U.S. tend to be more long-standing migrants who have their families there and send less money home. Many more Salvadorans are not in the program, with growing numbers entering the U.S. illegally over the past decade fleeing violence and poverty.
""I don't think that family remittances are going to fall in the short term,"" Membreno said.
He also thinks some Salvadoran families in the U.S. could start sending more money back — something that started when Donald Trump was elected president — so remittance figures could rise.
In addition, he said, many of those eventually returning could be skilled and have money to invest. ""All of this could generate a certain dynamism in the economy,"" he said.
Cesar Rios, director of the nonprofit group where Castro works, is less optimistic. ""Our country is not prepared to receive thousands of Salvadorans,"" he said.
Deportees are often targeted by gangs, because they believe they have money. Police also target them, because of the stigma that they are criminals.
""There's no work,"" Rios said. ""Between 200 and 300 Salvadorans continue leaving every day for the United States.""
Ernesto Godoy, standing outside a Western Union money transfer office in San Salvador, said he receives money from relatives with protected status in the United States. He worried the decision could lead to bigger problems in El Salvador.
""It's going to affect us, not only me, but on a national level, because here in El Salvador we make ends meet with remittances from the United States,"" Godoy said.

Daily Caller,"The Supreme Court Friday sided with a Korean immigrant who faced deportation as a result of faulty legal advice he received from his criminal defense attorney.
In a 6-2 opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court explained that a decision to risk almost certain conviction at trial in hopes of avoiding deportation is reasonable. The opinion was joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent joined by Justice Samuel Alito.
The case arose in 2009 when a lawful permanent resident named Jae Lee was arrested for possessing ecstasy with intent to distribute. Lee and his family immigrated to the United States when he was 13. He resided in the U.S. for over 20 years, operated two successful restaurants in the Memphis, Tenn. suburbs, and never returned to his native Korea.
After his arrest, Lee accepted a plea deal from federal prosecutors to serve 366 days in prison. Though he repeatedly expressed concerns to his lawyer about the prospect of deportation, he was assured that accepting the plea bargain would not result in his removal from the United States. The advice, however, was incorrect, and the government announced it would deport Lee at the conclusion of his prison sentence.
Lee sought to have his plea and conviction set aside for ineffective assistance of counsel. Lee argued avoiding deportation was the most important factor in his decision making, and that his choice to accept his lawyer’s advise turned on the assurance he would not be removed. The government countered that Lee could not show he had been prejudiced by his lawyer’s bad advise, because the evidence against him, overwhelming and incontrovertible, guaranteed a conviction and removal.
The Court disagreed with the government, finding that success at trial should not drive the inquiry. Roberts writes:
But common sense (not to mention our precedent) recognizes that there is more to consider than simply the likelihood of success at trial. The decision whether to plead guilty also involves assessing the respective consequences of a conviction after trial and by plea. When those consequences are, from the defendant’s perspective, similarly dire, even the smallest chance of success at trial may look attractive. For example, a defendant with no realistic defense to a charge carrying a 20-year sentence may nevertheless choose trial, if the prosecution’s plea offer is 18 years. Here Lee alleges that avoiding deportation was the determinative factor for him; deportation after some time in prison was not meaningfully different from deportation after somewhat less time. He says he accordingly would have rejected any plea leading to deportation—even if it shaved off prison time—in favor of throwing a “Hail Mary” at trial.
The opinion makes no mention of the possibility that Lee would seek to avoid deportation through the plea bargaining process itself. During oral arguments in March, Justice Kagan suggested that Lee could negotiate a plea entailing a longer jail sentence provided he was not removed from the United States.
The outcome was somewhat surprising, as Roberts himself seemed rather hostile to Lee’s position when the case was argued.
Writing in dissent, Justice Thomas warned the ruling would have “pernicious consequences for the criminal justice system.”
“The Court today provides no assurance that plea deals negotiated in good faith with guilty defendants will remain final,” he wrote.","the supreme court friday sided with a korean immigrant who faced deportation as a result of faulty legal advice he received from his criminal defense attorney. in a 6 - 2 opinion written by chief justice john roberts, the court explained that a decision to risk almost certain conviction at trial in hopes of avoiding deportation is reasonable. the opinion was joined by justices anthony kennedy, ruth bader ginsburg, stephen breyer, sonia sotomayor, and elena kagan. justice clarence thomas wrote a dissent joined by justice samuel alito. the case arose in 2009 when a lawful permanent resident named jae lee was arrested for possessing ecstasy with intent to distribute. lee and his family immigrated to the united states when he was 13. he resided in the u. s. for over 20 years, operated two successful restaurants in the memphis, tenn. suburbs, and never returned to his native korea. after his arrest, lee accepted a plea deal from federal prosecutors to serve 366 days in prison. though he repeatedly expressed concerns to his lawyer about the prospect of deportation, he was assured that accepting the plea bargain would not result in his removal from the united states. the advice, however, was incorrect, and the government announced it would deport lee at the conclusion of his prison sentence. lee sought to have his plea and conviction set aside for ineffective assistance of counsel. lee argued avoiding deportation was the most important factor in his decision making, and that his choice to accept his lawyer ’ s advise turned on the assurance he would not be removed. the government countered that lee could not show he had been prejudiced by his lawyer ’ s bad advise, because the evidence against him, overwhelming and incontrovertible, guaranteed a conviction and removal. the court disagreed with the government, finding that success at trial should not drive the inquiry. roberts writes : but common sense ( not to mention our precedent ) recognizes that there is more to consider than simply the likelihood of success at trial. the decision whether to plead guilty also involves assessing the respective consequences of a conviction after trial and by plea. when those consequences are, from the defendant ’ s perspective, similarly dire, even the smallest chance of success at trial may look attractive. for example, a defendant with no realistic defense to a charge carrying a 20 - year sentence may nevertheless choose trial, if the prosecution ’ s plea offer is 18 years. here lee alleges that avoiding deportation was the determinative factor for him ; deportation after some time in prison was not meaningfully different from deportation after somewhat less time. he says",0.999972939491272,0.49997292606713,0,435,2.07,2.53,8.74,0.92,1.38,6.44,14.02,4.14,1.84,1.38,2.07,0.92,3.91,0.46,0.92,0.23,0.23,0.0,11.95,0.23,0.0,0.0,5.06,0.23,0.23,1.38,0.23,0.0,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23,0.0,0.92,1.38,4.83,0.92,3.22,0.46,0.0,0.23,4.14,5.29,1.61,0.92,7.816091954022989,11.03448275862069,1.6091954022988506
Daily Caller,"MSOutletName host Ali Velshi compared Americans’ feelings toward illegal immigration to Germany and Rwanda during a segment on his show Tuesday afternoon with OutletName correspondent Morgan Radford.
They were discussing how hot topic issues like heath care and immigration could impact the midterms in a from week.
“When you talk about the economy or you talk about health care, it’s remarkably experiential, right? I often say the economy is your economy, whatever economy you have you’re feeling, right? But immigration is not that to a lot of people. Many people to whom immigration is the highest priority don’t have a negative experience with immigration,” Velshi stated.
“Which is what’s interesting, right? Because I’ve been covering these MAGA rallies. What it seems to boil down to just as a reporter watching this is about safety. Not only safety in terms of your personal and social position but also in terms of your pocketbook and in some cases crime. But we’re kind of seeing people create these oppositions out of things that they’re not necessarily —” Radford responded.
“And otherness, which by the way, we’ve seen all through history, in Germany, in Rwanda, in the Balkans and otherness, when people feel insecure, identify some group,” Velshi added.
While the MSOutletName host didn’t specify, his comparison to Rwanda is likely in regards to the Rwandan genocide in the mid 1990s. According to United To End Genocide, approximately 800,000 Tutsis and Hutus were murdered during a “carefully organized program of genocide over 100 days.” His other comparison to Germany is probably a reference to the Holocaust.
Redford continued, “And the cognitive dissonance, right? I’m sitting there interviewing a woman at the last MAGA rally and she says, you know, I don’t mind Latinos, looking at me, but, you know, they have a very matriarchal society she says and I even like their food, but I don’t want them coming here if they cross the border.

Breitbart,"Politico’s White House reporter, Nancy Cook, came out with a curious article on Thursday, laying out how, with Congress unlikely to approve any funding for President Donald Trump’s planned border wall, he should instead go the route of a national emergency declaration, and that it is OutletName News that has been leading the way in framing the argument for such a declaration.
Cook wrote:
The White House is finalizing details of a potential national emergency declaration to secure President Donald Trump’s border wall, even as lawmakers are trying to broker an immigration deal that could avert another shutdown in just over two weeks. Trump met with his budget chief, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Jared Kushner and other top officials, including White House lawyers, on Tuesday to walk through the logistics of such a move. And White House aides have been quietly meeting with outside conservative political groups to build support for the president to take such an action. Those talking points, which emphasize Trump’s legal authority, have begun to show up in such conservative media outlets as OutletName News.
OutletName News has certainly been ahead of the curve with the rest of the media on this particular matter. A week ago, on Jan. 24, OutletName News legal editor Ken Klukowski explained how President Trump has the legal authority–already delegated to him from Congress–to build the wall on the border.
Klukowski explains:
Congress has passed 136 statutory provisions pertaining to presidential emergency powers over the years, delegating significant authority to the president when he declares an emergency. Congress’s research arm notes that in certain types of emergencies, these powers include restricting travel, seizing commodities or property, and regulating businesses.
Not only that, but Congress specifically amended the Posse Comitatus Act – the law that prevents U.S. military troops from operating on U.S. soil, found at 18 U.S.C. § 1385 – in the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act to allow U.S. troops to function domestically under certain circumstances. One of those circumstances is to enforce federal law. Another is that the defense secretary can deploy troops to stop illegal aliens from crossing the U.S. border if the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requests military assistance.
Klukowski cites federal law, specifically 33 U.S.C. § 2293(a), in which, once the president declares an emergency, the Secretary of Defense:
…without regard to any other provision of law, may … apply the resources of the Department of the Army’s civil works program, including funds, personnel, and equipment, to construct or assist in the construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of authorized civil works, military construction, and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense.
Klukowski adds in the next paragraphs:
The next subsection of that law adds that this authority continues until the president declares the emergency has ended, plus an additional 180 days. Congress passed the Secure Fence Act in 2006, which explicitly authorizes building physical barriers on the U.S.-Mexican border. But even if Congress had not passed that law, the separate law quoted above gives President Trump all the authority he needs to act without further approval from Capitol Hill. Once President Trump declares an emergency on the border, he can direct Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to order the Army Corps of Engineers to begin constructing the wall. Congress has already appropriated $13.9 billion in emergency funds that the Corps can use, much more funding than the president’s $5.7 billion plan calls for. Additionally, if DHS requests military support, the Pentagon can then also send however many additional troops the president needs to protect the workers and secure the border during construction. Lawsuits are likely, but it is possible that only Congress itself has standing to sue. The only other injury that any other plaintiff could claim is that they have a legal right to illegally enter the United States. Even the most liberal judicial activist might look askance at such a lawsuit.
It’s hardly just that Klukowski piece that Cook is talking about. On Thursday, OutletName News’s Michael Patrick Leahy reported on how the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) has determined that President Trump can build the wall legally without further congressional authorization. From Leahy’s report on the CRS report:
“The circumstances in which the Section 2808 authority [of Title 10 of the U.S. Code that codifies the National Emergencies Act] could be used to deploy fencing along the border appears to be a question of first impression, and one that is likely to be vigorously litigated,” the CRS report noted. The report cited two sections of Title 10 of the U.S. Code: Section 2803 and Section 284, which are are separate and distinct from Section 2808, the section of Title 10 that grants presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act. Section 2803, “provides that the Secretary of Defense ‘may carry out a military construction project not otherwise authorized by law’ upon determining that (1) ‘the project is vital to the national security or to the protection of health, safety, or the quality of the environment,’ and (2) ‘the requirement for the project is so urgent that’ deferring the project ‘would be inconsistent with national security or the protection of health, safety, or environmental quality.’ ” Section 284, “provides that the Secretary of Defense ‘may provide support for the counterdrug activities or activities to counter transnational organized crime’ of any law enforcement agency, including through the ‘[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States.’ The caveat related to Section 284 is that the Department of Defense’s “authority to construct fences appears to extend only to ‘drug smuggling corridors,’ a condition that may limit where DOD could deploy fencing.”
Also this week, OutletName News’s Sean Moran interviewed Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL)–a leading authority on immigration policy on Capitol Hill–about a national emergency declaration.
Brooks told OutletName News:
We have a national emergency at the border, the President of the United States ought to declare a national emergency to save roughly 50 American lives per day, or, over 15,000 American lives per year. I encourage the President to use the United States Code 10 Section 284, which empowers the President of the United States to order America’s military to the border, to assist law enforcement agents in the fight against drugs and transnational crime. Interestingly, 10 U.S.C. 284 which has already been approved by Congress, which has already been signed by a president, empowers the Pentagon to deploy both active military and national guard troops to transport personnel, supplies and equipment, establish and operate bases of operation, detect and monitor surface traffic in Mexico. And, within 25 miles of the border in the United States, to construct roads, fences, lighting, to block drugs and smuggling corridors in the aerial and ground reconnaissance.
OutletName News has published a number of other pieces about this in recent weeks, including video of a Department of Defense official explaining the rationale for such a declaration, polling data showing Trump’s base would gladly support him on such a decision, news on Trump’s comments about his authority to make such a declaration, and congressional leaders discussing the possibility.
As the negotiations have continued between the White House and congressional leaders on this issue–in the leadup, during, and after the longest government shutdown in U.S. history which ended last week–OutletName News’s Neil Munro and John Binder have also had cutting edge news reporting from inside the negotiating room about the thus-far-failed talks.
That’s not all. The Cartel Chronicles team for OutletName News on the U.S. border with Mexico, led by editor Brandon Darby, also broke a big story that provides justification for the idea that there is a national emergency on the border: A cartel operating along the Laredo Sector of Texas’s border with Mexico has now been taken over by an actual terrorist, someone convicted of bombing a U.S. consulate.
Darby and Idelfonso Ortiz reported exclusively for OutletName News:
A verified and convicted terrorist who attacked a U.S. Consulate with a grenade and automatic rifle fire has taken over the ruthless Los Zetas cartel, a group headquartered at the Texas border in the Nuevo Laredo-Laredo metropolitan border area. Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, sits immediately across the border from Laredo, Texas, and is the only urban location along the entire U.S.-Mexico Border that does not have any fencing or constructed security barrier of any kind. The convicted terrorist, Hector Raul Luna Luna, is known as “El Tory” and was convicted in the 2008 terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey, Mexico. He was released from prison due to bribes paid by Cartel Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and has now taken over the dominant faction of Los Zetas, Cartel Del Noreste (CDN), to open up the lucrative and unsecured border corridor into Texas.
It remains to be seen what will happen next. The federal government is only open until Feb. 15 and Democrats on Capitol Hill have flatly refused to negotiate with Trump for the wall, despite some indicating openness to building a wall. Trump will give his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening in the House, with exactly ten days to go before government funding lapses again. If Congress fails yet again to get a deal, though, as OutletName News has repeatedly shown, Trump still has a path to build the wall. The only looming question then is whether he will do it.","politico ’ s white house reporter, nancy cook, came out with a curious article on thursday, laying out how, with congress unlikely to approve any funding for president donald trump ’ s planned border wall, he should instead go the route of a national emergency declaration, and that it is outletname news that has been leading the way in framing the argument for such a declaration. cook wrote : the white house is finalizing details of a potential national emergency declaration to secure president donald trump ’ s border wall, even as lawmakers are trying to broker an immigration deal that could avert another shutdown in just over two weeks. trump met with his budget chief, acting chief of staff mick mulvaney, jared kushner and other top officials, including white house lawyers, on tuesday to walk through the logistics of such a move. and white house aides have been quietly meeting with outside conservative political groups to build support for the president to take such an action. those talking points, which emphasize trump ’ s legal authority, have begun to show up in such conservative media outlets as outletname news. outletname news has certainly been ahead of the curve with the rest of the media on this particular matter. a week ago, on jan. 24, outletname news legal editor ken klukowski explained how president trump has the legal authority – already delegated to him from congress – to build the wall on the border. klukowski explains : congress has passed 136 statutory provisions pertaining to presidential emergency powers over the years, delegating significant authority to the president when he declares an emergency. congress ’ s research arm notes that in certain types of emergencies, these powers include restricting travel, seizing commodities or property, and regulating businesses. not only that, but congress specifically amended the posse comitatus act – the law that prevents u. s. military troops from operating on u. s. soil, found at 18 u. s. c. § 1385 – in the 2007 national defense authorization act to allow u. s. troops to function domestically under certain circumstances. one of those circumstances is to enforce federal law. another is that the defense secretary can deploy troops to stop illegal aliens from crossing the u. s. border if the u. s. department of homeland security ( dhs ) requests military assistance. klukowski cites federal law, specifically 33 u. s. c. § 2293 ( a ), in which, once the president declares an emergency, the secretary of defense : … without regard to any other provision of law",3.42954917869e-05,0.499965667724609,0,408,2.45,2.21,14.95,0.98,0.74,13.48,8.82,1.72,0.74,0.98,1.23,0.25,3.43,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.25,0.0,11.76,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.98,0.0,0.98,5.64,0.98,0.0,0.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.0,1.23,9.8,2.45,6.37,1.23,0.25,0.0,2.94,3.19,2.7,0.74,7.8431372549019605,7.8431372549019605,0.9803921568627451
HuffPost,"Ten state attorneys general and a governor demanded on Thursday that the Trump administration start winding down protections for hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. If the government doesn’t act by Sept. 5, they said they’ll see President Donald Trump in court.
Trump campaigned on a promise to stop the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, but he hasn’t done so yet ― although his administration has officially rescinded a similar program meant to protect undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.
The latter program never went into effect, thanks to a lawsuit led by Texas officials. Now the same state is heading the charge against DACA, which has been operating since 2012 and provides two-year permits for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as kids. If Texas and the nine other states sue or otherwise convince Trump to end DACA, nearly 800,000 of these immigrants, often called Dreamers, could end up unable to work legally and at greater risk of deportation.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton was joined by the attorneys general from Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia, along with Idaho Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter, in sending a warning letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
In their letter, they asked the administration to phase out DACA by ending the distribution of new permits and the renewal of current permits. They said this would not require the federal government to rescind any permits or deport anyone.
Still, it would eventually cost all DACA recipients their protected status, which has allowed them to work legally, obtain driver’s licenses and, in some cases, travel outside the U.S. for the first time since entering as minors. They would be back in the same precarious state they were before ― and at potentially greater risk of deportation as Trump ramps up enforcement efforts.","ten state attorneys general and a governor demanded on thursday that the trump administration start winding down protections for hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants who came to the u. s. as children. if the government doesn ’ t act by sept. 5, they said they ’ ll see president donald trump in court. trump campaigned on a promise to stop the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, or daca, but he hasn ’ t done so yet ― although his administration has officially rescinded a similar program meant to protect undocumented parents of u. s. citizens and lawful permanent residents. the latter program never went into effect, thanks to a lawsuit led by texas officials. now the same state is heading the charge against daca, which has been operating since 2012 and provides two - year permits for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the u. s. as kids. if texas and the nine other states sue or otherwise convince trump to end daca, nearly 800, 000 of these immigrants, often called dreamers, could end up unable to work legally and at greater risk of deportation. texas attorney general ken paxton was joined by the attorneys general from alabama, arkansas, idaho, kansas, louisiana, nebraska, south carolina, tennessee and west virginia, along with idaho gov. c. l. “ butch ” otter, in sending a warning letter to attorney general jeff sessions. in their letter, they asked the administration to phase out daca by ending the distribution of new permits and the renewal of current permits. they said this would not require the federal government to rescind any permits or deport anyone. still, it would eventually cost all daca recipients their protected status, which has allowed them to work legally, obtain driver ’ s licenses and, in some cases, travel outside the u. s. for the first time since entering as minors. they would be back in the same precarious state they were before ― and at potentially greater risk of deportation as trump ramps up enforcement efforts.",0.999976754188537,0.499976795879775,1,328,3.05,3.05,9.45,0.61,1.22,7.62,11.89,0.91,2.74,1.52,3.35,0.3,4.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.02,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.61,0.0,0.3,3.35,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.83,8.23,2.44,5.49,0.3,0.0,0.0,6.4,4.27,2.13,0.91,6.097560975609756,5.7926829268292686,0.9146341463414633
CNN,"US President Donald Trump doubled down on his claims tying immigrants to crime as he made his case for the border wall in an Oval Office address Tuesday night. “Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now,” Trump said. But many researchers argue that immigrants are, in fact, less likely to commit crimes. Here’s a look at some key statistics, where they come from and what people on different sides of the debate say about them. 10.7 million
That’s the latest estimate of the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center. That’s less than 4% of the total US population. 105,140
The number of immigrants ICE arrested in fiscal year 2018 who were convicted criminals. ICE says it’s committed to targeting “criminal aliens” for arrest and removal. Advocates accuse ICE of inflating statistics about criminals by including minor charges such as traffic offenses in its tally. 83,573
The number of inmates in state and federal prisons who are not US citizens, according to the latest prison population report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. That’s less than 6% of the total prison population. The report says that the total number of inmates who are not US citizens could, in fact, be higher, noting that some states may have undercounted this figure and others did not provide information. A past report from the bureau cautioned that different jurisdictions use different definitions for “noncitizens,” at times basing the statistic on where people were born regardless of their citizenship status. 21%
Administration officials have noted that roughly one in five inmates in federal prison are foreign-born, and that the vast majority of those people are in the United States illegally. They argue such statistics show the dangers illegal immigration poses to society. “The illegal immigrant crime rate in this country should be zero,” US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement earlier this year. “Every crime committed by an illegal alien is, by definition, a crime that should have been prevented.” Advocates have slammed statistics released by the administration. “The vast majority of immigrants in federal prison are there for crimes that only immigrants can be charged with – illegal entry and illegal entry after removal,” Tom Jawetz, the vice president for immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, told OutletName in 2017. “When you cook the books you shouldn’t pretend to be surprised by the results.” 719
The criminal conviction rate per 100,000 immigrants in Texas. This number comes from a study by the Cato Institute, which uses figures from Texas in 2015 as a case study to look at how crime rates compare among immigrant and native-born populations. “The criminal conviction and arrest rates for immigrants were well below those of native-born Americans,” Cato’s Alex Nowrasteh wrote. According to the libertarian think tank’s analysis, the rate per 100,000 residents in each subpopulation was 899 for undocumented immigrants, 611 for legal immigrants and 1,797 for native-born Americans. 142%
This is how much more likely undocumented immigrants are to be convicted of a crime than other Arizonans, according to a study of data in that state by economist John Lott of the Crime Prevention Research Center. This study has been pointed to by the Justice Department and by a number of politicians and organizations who favor restricting immigration. It’s also drawn sharp criticism from the Cato Institute and other researchers, who argue that the study misinterpreted data. Lott has stood by his research. An analysis of the study and critiques by The Washington Post’s Fact Checker was inconclusive. 25
The number of years of crime and immigration data researchers looked at in a recent study published in the journal Criminology. “Increases in the undocumented immigrant population within states are associated with significant decreases in the prevalence of violence,” authors Michael Light and Ty Miller wrote. An analysis of data from 1990-2014, they said, suggests “undocumented immigration over this period is generally associated with decreasing violent crime.” The authors noted that more research needs to be done, and that it’s possible the data could be interpreted differently. “Because we are using official crime statistics,” they wrote, “there is a plausible alternative interpretation: Increased unauthorized immigration results in fewer crimes reported to the police.” In a release from the University of Wisconsin-Madison announcing the study’s findings, Light, a sociology professor, said it’s important to look at data as the immigration debate continues. “I think public debate divorced entirely from data is problematic,” he said. “There are reasons to think undocumented immigrants would increase crime, but the data doesn’t support those arguments. It’s telling us that has not been the case.”","us president donald trump doubled down on his claims tying immigrants to crime as he made his case for the border wall in an oval office address tuesday night. “ over the years, thousands of americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don ’ t act right now, ” trump said. but many researchers argue that immigrants are, in fact, less likely to commit crimes. here ’ s a look at some key statistics, where they come from and what people on different sides of the debate say about them. 10. 7 million that ’ s the latest estimate of the number of unauthorized immigrants in the united states, according to the pew research center. that ’ s less than 4 % of the total us population. 105, 140 the number of immigrants ice arrested in fiscal year 2018 who were convicted criminals. ice says it ’ s committed to targeting “ criminal aliens ” for arrest and removal. advocates accuse ice of inflating statistics about criminals by including minor charges such as traffic offenses in its tally. 83, 573 the number of inmates in state and federal prisons who are not us citizens, according to the latest prison population report from the bureau of justice statistics. that ’ s less than 6 % of the total prison population. the report says that the total number of inmates who are not us citizens could, in fact, be higher, noting that some states may have undercounted this figure and others did not provide information. a past report from the bureau cautioned that different jurisdictions use different definitions for “ noncitizens, ” at times basing the statistic on where people were born regardless of their citizenship status. 21 % administration officials have noted that roughly one in five inmates in federal prison are foreign - born, and that the vast majority of those people are in the united states illegally. they argue such statistics show the dangers illegal immigration poses to society. “ the illegal immigrant crime rate in this country should be zero, ” us attorney general jeff sessions said in a statement earlier this year. “ every crime committed by an illegal alien is, by definition, a crime that should have been prevented. ” advocates have slammed statistics released by the administration. “ the vast majority of immigrants in federal prison are there for crimes that only immigrants can be charged with – illegal entry and illegal entry after removal, ” tom jawetz, the vice president for immigration policy at the center for american progress, told outletname in 2017. “ when you cook the books you shouldn ’ t pretend to be",0.999982833862304,0.499982886651196,1,431,4.18,7.19,7.89,1.62,0.7,5.57,6.5,0.93,0.46,0.93,1.16,0.0,2.78,0.0,0.46,0.0,0.46,0.0,12.76,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.0,2.32,0.23,0.23,0.7,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23,0.23,0.0,0.7,8.58,0.7,7.19,0.7,0.0,0.0,3.71,3.94,3.02,0.46,9.51276102088167,9.048723897911833,0.6960556844547563
CNN,"President Donald Trump is considering a new rule that could dramatically limit the ability of Central American migrants to claim asylum if they enter the United States by land through Mexico, according to a senior administration official and a source close to the White House.
The regulation is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to toughen the US asylum process and has the potential of affecting a large swath of migrants journeying to the US-Mexico border.
Over recent months, migrants predominantly from Central American countries have accounted for the majority of apprehensions at the southern border. They've had to travel through Mexico to reach the border and upon arriving in the US, some have turned themselves in to Border Patrol and claimed asylum.
The regulation would prohibit migrants who have resided in a third country from seeking asylum. It would, therefore, bar migrants transiting through Mexico from being able to claim asylum and as a result, drastically limit who's eligible for asylum. One official said the regulation would be an interim final rule, which could allow the new restrictions to go into effect immediately.","president donald trump is considering a new rule that could dramatically limit the ability of central american migrants to claim asylum if they enter the united states by land through mexico, according to a senior administration official and a source close to the white house. the regulation is the latest attempt by the trump administration to toughen the us asylum process and has the potential of affecting a large swath of migrants journeying to the us - mexico border. over recent months, migrants predominantly from central american countries have accounted for the majority of apprehensions at the southern border. they've had to travel through mexico to reach the border and upon arriving in the us, some have turned themselves in to border patrol and claimed asylum. the regulation would prohibit migrants who have resided in a third country from seeking asylum. it would, therefore, bar migrants transiting through mexico from being able to claim asylum and as a result, drastically limit who's eligible for asylum. one official said the regulation would be an interim final rule, which could allow the new restrictions to go into effect immediately.",0.999970912933349,0.499970973072777,1,186,1.08,4.3,8.06,0.0,1.08,6.99,9.14,2.15,2.69,2.69,1.61,0.0,1.08,0.0,0.54,0.54,0.0,0.0,6.99,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.54,1.61,0.54,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.54,12.9,3.23,9.68,0.54,0.0,0.0,3.76,2.69,2.15,0.54,3.723404255319149,7.9787234042553195,0.0
NYTimes,"Representative Duncan D. Hunter, a Republican in San Diego who is also a Democratic target, issued a statement after Mr. Issa’s announcement, declaring that he is “100 percent running.” But Mr. Hunter is under investigation by the F.B.I. on allegations of misusing campaign funds, making him particularly vulnerable, officials in both parties said, and there is speculation in political circles that he ultimately will step aside. (If Mr. Hunter did step aside, that would probably increase Republican chances of holding the seat, given his party’s registration advantage there.)
The turmoil comes as California has emerged as the front line in Democratic efforts to win back the House. Seven of the 14-member Republican congressional delegation represent districts that Hillary Clinton won against Mr. Trump in 2016, including Mr. Issa and Mr. Royce. The party needs to capture 24 Republican seats to win back power. Democrats began recruiting candidates, raising money and setting up field operations here nearly six months ago.

Mr. Trump’s disapproval rating among independent voters, whose support is critical for any Republican hoping to win, shot up 20 percentage points from the week after his inauguration to the end of last year, from 48 percent to 68 percent, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. Independents make up 25 percent of the California electorate, a decimal point less than Republicans.
The president had a 73 percent approval rating among California Republicans in a poll last month by the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, which, while high, was still considerably below what Barack Obama enjoyed among Democratic voters when he was president.
Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans have championed a tax bill widely assailed as punishing to California homeowners, dismantled policies aimed at fighting climate change and pushed tough and restrictive immigration policies. Last year, Californians voted to legalize recreational marijuana by a hefty margin of 57 percent to 42 percent; days after the law took effect on Jan. 1, the Justice Department announced it would aggressively enforce federal strictures against the drug.
The Interior Department moved last week to allow offshore oil drilling, a policy that has a long history of bipartisan opposition among Californians. The next day, it exempted Florida from the policy in response to pleas from Rick Scott, the Republican governor running for Senate, drawing accusations that the Trump administration was punishing this state.
“Most days for California Republicans in Congress are days spent on defense,” said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and a former senior adviser to Pete Wilson, a Republican governor. “Defense spent on why Donald Trump wants to pull the country out of the Paris accords. Defense trying to explain why the president won’t give the same offshore drilling waiver to California as it did to Florida. And defense trying to explain the latest thing Donald Trump said that he’s now denying that he said.” Mr. Chávez said he would not have voted for the tax bill and opposed the tough immigration policies backed by some Republicans in Congress. “Offshore drilling — I don’t support it,” he said. “I’ve been in California my whole life. I remember the Santa Barbara spill.”
For all that, Republicans have some reason to hope they can withstand any Democratic wave. The fact that Mrs. Clinton won districts represented by these seven Republicans does not mean that voters will necessarily support a Democratic candidate for Congress in November. Although Republican enrollment in this state has been on a steady decline, the party continues to have a registration edge in these districts. Historically, Democratic turnout drops in nonpresidential years — especially in California.

“As a 34-year resident of Irvine in Orange County and as someone who has long been active at a variety of levels in political and policy debates, I am also reluctant to conclude that Democrats in a midterm election will be able to turnout a sufficient number of voters to overcome the current advantages Republicans still have in the districts,” said Mark P. Petracca, a professor of political science at the University of California, Irvine.
Jim Brulte, the California Republican leader, said voters made their decision based on the candidates, not the party. He said he did not think Mr. Trump was an albatross on his candidates.
“Look, Republicans lost every statewide race in California in 2002, 2010 and 2014, before Donald Trump even announced he was running for president,” Mr. Brulte said. “So anybody who wants to blame Donald Trump for the problems of the Republican Party, which began 20 years ago, is a revisionist historian.”
It has long been a tough climb to get elected as a Republican in California. But Mr. Trump’s presidency has pushed a party already struggling closer to the brink. Republicans and Democrats said that the level of anger at Mr. Trump could very well push up Democratic turnout in these districts.
“It was already difficult,” said Rob Stutzman, a Republican political consultant in Sacramento. “But he’s made it more difficult.”
Mark Baldassare, the president of the Public Policy Institute of California, said Mr. Trump’s stand on issues “has been at odds even with many Republicans” in the state, “especially on immigration.” “In our polling, we have seen majorities of Republicans saying they want a path to citizenship,” he said. “They support DACA,” the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects so-called Dreamers from deportation.

The offshore drilling policy was the latest complication for Republican candidates. In a poll taken in 2017 by the Public Policy Institute, 69 percent of respondents said they opposed opening up offshore sites for drilling. Republicans were more supportive — 50 percent said they backed it — but majorities of Republicans who live near the coast opposed it. Mr. Issa’s district runs along the coast.
Last week, moderate Republicans, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former governor, announced they were creating an organization intended to try to save the state party, in part by differentiating it on issues like immigration and climate change.
“What works nationally doesn’t work in California,” said Chad Mayes, a State Assembly member and one of the founders of the group. “We are in a death spiral. We have to get out of this death spiral.”
Mr. Trump is a historically weak political figure here. He drew 31.5 percent of the vote against Hillary Clinton, an even poorer showing than Herbert Hoover posted when he ran against Franklin D. Roosevelt in the midst of the Depression.
And he poses a challenge to Republican candidates for state and federal office who need the votes of the Republican base, who support Mr. Trump. The result: Candidates have spoken warmly about Mr. Trump at forums where they need to win Republican support.
“Californians are waking up to one of the best economies we have seen in decades, since Ronald Reagan was president,” said Travis Allen, a Republican State Assembly member who is running for governor. “The Trump effect on the economy is being felt across the country — even in California. I fully expect this to continue and to be a huge benefit for every Californian.”
Mr. Whalen of the Hoover Institution said that Mr. Trump “is not the person with whom you are going to identify the future of the party.”

Daily Caller,"Voters support most of the provisions in a bill backed by President Donald Trump that would move the U.S. to a merit-based immigration system and slash legal immigration levels by nearly 50 percent over the next decade, according to a poll released Wednesday.
The RAISE Act, sponsored by Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, would dramatically curtail family-based migration in favor of giving priority to high-skilled immigrants. It would also end the diversity visa lottery program and cap annual refugee admissions at 50,000. Some of those provisions received support from more than half of voters surveyed by POLITICO/Morning Consult, while other aspects of the bill are backed by significant pluralities.
A majority of voters — 58 percent — agree with limiting the number of refugees offered permanent residency. A slightly higher share — 60 percent — favor establishing a “points system” that assigns value based on criteria such as education, English proficiency and prospective earnings in the U.S.
Other aspects of the bill enjoy less overall support, but those provisions still have more backers than opponents. Just under half — 48 percent — of voters support reducing the number of legal immigrants by half over the next decade, compared to 39 percent who oppose the cut. As for family-based chain migration, 45 percent want to block U.S. citizens and permanent residents from petitioning for green cards for extended family members, while 39 percent oppose ending the practice.
An English language proficiency requirement garners the most support — 62 percent of voters say it should be a factor in choosing who can legally immigrate to the U.S.
The RAISE Act generated instant controversy when it was formally introduced last week. At a White House press briefing, Trump administration senior adviser Stephen Miller sparred with several reporters who suggested that the bill was motivated by racial and ethnic animus. Miller and the bill’s Senate backers argue it will help poor and and low-skilled American workers by reducing the pool of immigrants competing with them for jobs.
As the POLITICO poll shows, voters appear to be more comfortable with the RAISE Act than Washington media reporting would suggest.
“Even the more controversial provisions in this legislation receive support from a plurality of voters,” said Morning Consult co-founder and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp. “The reason for this is ostensibly that Republican support is more consolidated than Democratic opposition. For example, 73 percent of Republican voters support reducing the number of legal immigrants, compared to 57 percent of Democrats who oppose that idea.”

HuffPost,"President Donald Trump said in a Friday afternoon press conference that he could declare a national emergency over immigration at the southern U.S. border to circumvent the need for congressional approval to build a border wall.
Asked specifically whether he has considered granting himself the authority to build his much-discussed wall, Trump replied, “Yes, I have.”
“And I can do it if I want,” he told reporters gathered in the White House Rose Garden.
“We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.”
A dispute over funding for the massive infrastructure project Trump first proposed on the campaign trail led to the partial government shutdown that began two weeks ago.
As a portion of federal workers continue to go without paychecks and a new Congress convened this week, Democrats and Republicans have yet to come to an agreement over the Trump administration’s border security demands. Trump has said that he is willing to wait “as long as it takes” to obtain funds for the wall, which became one of his central campaign promises.
A Friday meeting to discuss the shutdown was characterized differently by each side. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called it a “contentious” discussion, but Trump claimed it had been “productive.” His administration has asked for $5.6 billion for the project.
Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, OutletName reported Friday that the president has discussed using funds from the Department of Defense, among several other options, as an alternative to making a deal.
The Washington Post’s Robert Costa said an unnamed former Trump adviser told the paper that the president was “willing to send the Army Corps of Engineers down to the border and start digging” if he does not get what he wants.
Exactly how the wall might materialize, though, has become nearly as uncertain as its financing. While Trump originally described a solid concrete structure, he has since indicated the barrier could take the form of a steel slatted fence.","president donald trump said in a friday afternoon press conference that he could declare a national emergency over immigration at the southern u. s. border to circumvent the need for congressional approval to build a border wall. asked specifically whether he has considered granting himself the authority to build his much - discussed wall, trump replied, “ yes, i have. ” “ and i can do it if i want, ” he told reporters gathered in the white house rose garden. “ we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. ” a dispute over funding for the massive infrastructure project trump first proposed on the campaign trail led to the partial government shutdown that began two weeks ago. as a portion of federal workers continue to go without paychecks and a new congress convened this week, democrats and republicans have yet to come to an agreement over the trump administration ’ s border security demands. trump has said that he is willing to wait “ as long as it takes ” to obtain funds for the wall, which became one of his central campaign promises. a friday meeting to discuss the shutdown was characterized differently by each side. senate minority leader chuck schumer ( d - n. y. ) and house speaker nancy pelosi ( d - calif. ) called it a “ contentious ” discussion, but trump claimed it had been “ productive. ” his administration has asked for $ 5. 6 billion for the project. citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, outletname reported friday that the president has discussed using funds from the department of defense, among several other options, as an alternative to making a deal. the washington post ’ s robert costa said an unnamed former trump adviser told the paper that the president was “ willing to send the army corps of engineers down to the border and start digging ” if he does not get what he wants. exactly how the wall might materialize, though, has become nearly as uncertain as its financing. while trump originally described a solid concrete structure, he has since indicated the barrier could take the form of a steel slatted fence.",0.999966502189636,0.499966451418004,1,342,1.75,3.22,6.73,0.58,0.29,5.85,11.4,0.88,2.05,2.34,2.05,0.58,3.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.22,0.29,0.88,5.26,1.46,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29,7.31,0.58,6.73,0.29,0.0,0.0,5.26,6.14,3.51,0.88,3.8011695906432745,8.47953216374269,1.1695906432748537
NYTimes,"Under sweeping policy changes introduced by Mr. Trump, ICE has gone after immigrants who were once not targeted, repopularizing workplace raids, arresting community leaders, and using previously frowned upon tactics to ferret out anyone who can be expelled from the country. As a result, the average daily population in immigration detention for the 2019 fiscal year has reached 45,890. ICE currently has funding to house only 40,520 people.
How are Republicans and Democrats both claiming a win?
Republicans are saying that they secured money for 5,000 additional immigration detention beds, while Democrats are saying that they managed to bring down detention numbers by 17.4 percent. Technically, both are true. Here’s why:
Both parties agreed in the proposal to fund an average daily population for 2019 of 45,724 ICE detainees, or about 5,000 more than the 2018 budget provided — allowing Republicans to claim their success.
But in order to reach that average by Sept. 30, the last day of the fiscal year, ICE will gradually have to decrease its detained population to 40,520, which represents about a 17 percent decrease from the 49,057 who are currently detained.
Why are some Republicans saying that the proposal allows for 58,500 beds?
Republican aides suggested in internal communications that the number of detained immigrants could reach 58,500 under the proposal through a process called reprogramming, which allows agencies to adjust their budgets to address unforeseen emergencies.
Under reprogramming, federal agencies can take money that has been appropriated by Congress for specific matters, and use it to fund other things. And though it is meant to be used sparingly, the Department of Homeland Security has often used reprogramming to fund extra detention beds.
Though it is a common tactic, Democrats argue that the amount of money that would need to be reprogrammed in order to reach 58,500 detention beds, $750 million, would be unprecedented.
And they argue that the congressional committees that are now controlled by Democrats would never approve such a large amount.","under sweeping policy changes introduced by mr. trump, ice has gone after immigrants who were once not targeted, repopularizing workplace raids, arresting community leaders, and using previously frowned upon tactics to ferret out anyone who can be expelled from the country. as a result, the average daily population in immigration detention for the 2019 fiscal year has reached 45, 890. ice currently has funding to house only 40, 520 people. how are republicans and democrats both claiming a win? republicans are saying that they secured money for 5, 000 additional immigration detention beds, while democrats are saying that they managed to bring down detention numbers by 17. 4 percent. technically, both are true. here ’ s why : both parties agreed in the proposal to fund an average daily population for 2019 of 45, 724 ice detainees, or about 5, 000 more than the 2018 budget provided — allowing republicans to claim their success. but in order to reach that average by sept. 30, the last day of the fiscal year, ice will gradually have to decrease its detained population to 40, 520, which represents about a 17 percent decrease from the 49, 057 who are currently detained. why are some republicans saying that the proposal allows for 58, 500 beds? republican aides suggested in internal communications that the number of detained immigrants could reach 58, 500 under the proposal through a process called reprogramming, which allows agencies to adjust their budgets to address unforeseen emergencies. under reprogramming, federal agencies can take money that has been appropriated by congress for specific matters, and use it to fund other things. and though it is meant to be used sparingly, the department of homeland security has often used reprogramming to fund extra detention beds. though it is a common tactic, democrats argue that the amount of money that would need to be reprogrammed in order to reach 58, 500 detention beds, $ 750 million, would be unprecedented. and they argue that the congressional committees that are now controlled by democrats would never approve such a large amount.",0.999958395957946,0.499958374584821,1,341,8.8,7.33,7.33,0.59,0.59,5.87,11.14,0.59,3.81,2.05,0.88,0.0,2.93,0.0,0.59,0.0,0.59,0.0,9.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.29,0.29,1.76,2.35,3.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.59,0.29,8.21,2.64,7.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.69,3.23,5.87,1.76,3.812316715542522,14.369501466275661,1.1730205278592376
NYTimes,"“It’s causing a lot of panic,” said Oscar Renteria, the owner of Renteria Vineyard Management, which employs about 180 farmworkers who are now pruning grapevines in the Napa Valley.
When word of the raids spread, he received a frenzy of emails from his supervisors asking him what to do if immigration officers showed up at the fields. One sent a notice to farmhands warning them to stay away from 7-Eleven stores in the area.
“Our work force frequently visits 7-Elevens,” said Mr. Renteria. “They’re very nervous. It’s another form of reminding them that they’re not welcome.”
The Obama administration largely took a lower-profile approach to enforcement, auditing employers’ compliance in documenting their workers’ status without conducting many on-site investigations. A handful of employers faced prominent criminal cases in recent years, but most companies employing workers illegally avoid serious charges, because it is often impossible to prove that they knew someone had handed in fake documents.
“The consequences are not that harsh, and the effect of the enforcement is less than it should be,” said Jessica M. Vaughan, the director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates tighter restrictions on immigration.
The law requires employers only to ensure that documents appear to be valid, and federal law prohibits them from requiring specific types of identification from workers.
Employers negotiate reduced administrative fines and sometimes put political pressure on local officials when they become targets, making the punishment for companies “weaker than it should be,” Ms. Vaughan said. “There are employers for whom the penalties are just the cost of doing business.”

The more lasting effect of raids is to spread fear among undocumented workers, who often end up bearing the brunt of enforcement action at the workplace.
“Having some semblance of a fear of workers’ being arrested will have a behavioral shift,” said William Riley, who spent 20 years as an ICE special agent, under both Bush presidencies and the Clinton and Obama administrations, and is now a consultant at Guidepost Solutions, working on corporate compliance. Mr. Riley said that under the last administration, people were more lax about working illegally, assuming they wouldn’t be arrested.
“There was slightly more complacency when it was pretty well known that there wasn’t a fear of being arrested in your workplace,” Mr. Riley said, nor much of a deterrent to “using fake documents to get a job.”
Mr. Renteria said he expected raids on farms soon, because the industry is a big employer of “people with complicated immigration status.” More than half of California’s agriculture workers lack documents, according to a federal survey. Mr. Renteria worries that if agents home in on the Napa area, no one will stay to harvest the grapes.
“They will start calling their cousins, aunts and uncles and finding the safest place where the work is,” he said.
The last flurry of public, on-site investigations happened under President George W. Bush, who sent immigration agents to several meatpacking plants and other workplaces. Those raids led to hundreds of arrests of workers and prompted many other employees to stop reporting to work, according to local news reports. But they also enraged advocates for immigrants and drew complaints from business owners.
The Obama administration changed tack and pursued employers mainly by inspecting their paperwork. Such audits doubled from fiscal years 2009 to 2013, reaching 3,127, then declined sharply.
Law enforcement may welcome a more aggressive approach under the new administration. But sending armed agents to the doorsteps of American companies could prove politically uncomfortable for Mr. Trump, who has portrayed himself as an ally to business.
Doris Meissner learned how quickly local politicians can spring into action when their hometown industries feel threatened. As head of the agency that preceded ICE, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, from 1993 to 2000, Ms. Meissner tried to focus on holding employers accountable.

She approved the start of Operation Vanguard in the 1990s, in which the agency asked for employee records in several Nebraska meatpacking plants. When it came time to pursue charges against some employers, Ms. Meissner said, she started receiving frantic calls from Nebraskans on Capitol Hill.
“The politics gets hot and heavy,” Ms. Meissner said. “These are communities that are heavily reliant on these industries. This is the major employer. These are the major consumers at the stores and the bowling alleys.”
Inspecting Employers Audits of employers were favored early in the Obama administration as an immigration enforcement tool, but their use then declined. Sometimes, the headline is not enough (or too much). 2010 2012 2014 2016 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0
Ms. Meissner says work-site raids don’t work in the long term because they fail to address the real magnet drawing people into the country: a need for laborers.
Cracking down on employers who violate the law is crucial, she said, and it isn’t right to employ people who are here illegally. But without a visa system allowing unmet labor needs to be addressed with foreigners, she said, ICE shouldn’t expect patchwork enforcement stings to persuade farms, hotels or meatpackers to stop employing unauthorized workers.
“When your laws don’t align with the market, then the market is always going to win,” Ms. Meissner said.
Advocates for immigrant workers said the raids were just the most recent source of a quiet terror reverberating across factory floors since Mr. Trump took office.
“When you have such a public thing happening close to home, folks feel the presence of ICE constantly,” said Mariela Martinez, the organizing director of the Garment Worker Center in Los Angeles. But her clients have families and children here, Ms. Martinez said, so they can’t just pack their bags and go.
“It’s not motivating people to self-deport,” she said. “It’s motivating people to not use their labor rights. It’s causing people to distrust government agencies.”

Ms. Martinez helps people in the garment industry file claims for back pay with the state when their employers pay them less than they’re owed. She said far fewer workers asked for restitution last year compared with 2016, partly because of concern that their bosses would call ICE if they spoke up.
That was the punishment one manufacturer meted out to Pablo, a 36-year-old sewing worker in Los Angeles who would not give his last name because he lacks papers and fears being identified by ICE. When he received a check for $92 after working three 11-hour days at a garment factory last month, Pablo insisted that he deserved more.
His boss responded by offering to pay him what he was owed, but only if Pablo offered up his home address. After signing another check, Pablo said, the factory owner said that he would call immigration officials and direct them to Pablo’s door.
“You feel terrible. You feel uncomfortable,” Pablo said. “I was so scared.” He called Ms. Martinez and they returned together the next day to tell the employer that the threat constituted illegal retaliation under California law. The employer backed down.
The 7-Eleven raids will give garment bosses even more control over their workers, Pablo said.
“Now they know the president is on their side,” he said, “so they feel like they can intimidate people and treat them badly and they will never talk.”
Still, Pablo has been here since he was 17, and has no plans to leave yet. He has bills to pay.","“ it ’ s causing a lot of panic, ” said oscar renteria, the owner of renteria vineyard management, which employs about 180 farmworkers who are now pruning grapevines in the napa valley. when word of the raids spread, he received a frenzy of emails from his supervisors asking him what to do if immigration officers showed up at the fields. one sent a notice to farmhands warning them to stay away from 7 - eleven stores in the area. “ our work force frequently visits 7 - elevens, ” said mr. renteria. “ they ’ re very nervous. it ’ s another form of reminding them that they ’ re not welcome. ” the obama administration largely took a lower - profile approach to enforcement, auditing employers ’ compliance in documenting their workers ’ status without conducting many on - site investigations. a handful of employers faced prominent criminal cases in recent years, but most companies employing workers illegally avoid serious charges, because it is often impossible to prove that they knew someone had handed in fake documents. “ the consequences are not that harsh, and the effect of the enforcement is less than it should be, ” said jessica m. vaughan, the director of policy studies for the center for immigration studies, which advocates tighter restrictions on immigration. the law requires employers only to ensure that documents appear to be valid, and federal law prohibits them from requiring specific types of identification from workers. employers negotiate reduced administrative fines and sometimes put political pressure on local officials when they become targets, making the punishment for companies “ weaker than it should be, ” ms. vaughan said. “ there are employers for whom the penalties are just the cost of doing business. ” advertisement continue reading the main story the more lasting effect of raids is to spread fear among undocumented workers, who often end up bearing the brunt of enforcement action at the workplace. “ having some semblance of a fear of workers ’ being arrested will have a behavioral shift, ” said william riley, who spent 20 years as an ice special agent, under both bush presidencies and the clinton and obama administrations, and is now a consultant at guidepost solutions, working on corporate compliance. mr. riley said that under the last administration, people were more lax about working illegally, assuming they wouldn ’ t be arrested. “ there was slightly more complacency when it was pretty well known that there wasn ’ t a fear of being arrested in your workplace, ” mr. riley said, nor much of a deterrent to “ using fake documents",0.999976396560669,0.499976340950525,1,409,1.47,4.89,10.51,0.49,0.98,9.05,9.78,2.2,2.44,0.49,1.96,0.24,2.93,0.0,1.22,1.22,0.0,0.0,14.67,0.0,0.0,0.24,1.47,0.0,0.0,8.07,2.2,0.0,0.24,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.73,8.31,0.73,6.11,0.49,0.0,0.24,3.91,4.16,2.44,0.24,3.4229828850855744,11.00244498777506,1.2224938875305624
FoxNews,"President Trump turned to an unlikely source Tuesday evening to find support for his hard-line immigration policies: his predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump tweeted a 2005 video in which Obama, then a senator, made a statement against illegal immigration, accompanied by the comment ""I agree with President Obama 100%"". ""We are a generous and welcoming people here in the United States,"" Obama says in the 31-second clip. ""But those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law. We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants into this country."" Obama is not the only Democrat cited by Trump and his supporters to justify crackdowns on illegal immigration. Another is former President Bill Clinton, whose State of the Union address in 1995 featured the following: ""All Americans ... are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country,"" Clinton said that night. ""The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens."" ""We are a nation of immigrants,"" Clinton added. ""But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it."" Tuesday's tweet came as the Trump administration wrestles with what to do if a caravan of some 7,000 people that originated in Central America arrives at the U.S.-Mexico border. The march appeared to begin as a group of about 160 who decided to band together in Honduras for protection against the gangs who prey on migrants traveling alone; it snowballed as the group moved north. It now has thousands of people and is facing more than 1,000 miles, likely farther, to the end of the journey. The caravan comes on the heels of a surge in apprehensions of families at the southern border, which has given Trump a fresh talking point to rally his base ahead of next month's midterm elections. Nearly a third of all people apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border during the budget year 2018 were families and children — about 157,248 out of 395,579 total apprehensions. In a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department on Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, suggested that the administration make a ""third party"" agreement with Mexico that would force any caravan members seeking asylum to do so in their country of arrival — Mexico. The lawmakers said the process already works that way in Europe.","president trump turned to an unlikely source tuesday evening to find support for his hard - line immigration policies : his predecessor, barack obama. trump tweeted a 2005 video in which obama, then a senator, made a statement against illegal immigration, accompanied by the comment "" i agree with president obama 100 % "".

FoxNews,"On Tuesday night, President Trump will deliver a primetime address to all Americans, speaking about the crisis at our southern border. As we speak, a partial government shutdown is still in effect as Democrats bury their heads in the sand, close their eyes and pretend that America's borders are totally safe and secure.
They are not. In fact, Democrats are adamantly refusing to give border patrol agents the tools they desperately need and are asking for. And that is a strategic wall on the southern border. But now, even one top Democrat is admitting that President Trump does, in fact, have the power to build a wall without any congressional approval whatsoever.
""There's a provision in law that says the president can declare an emergency,"" said U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., in an interview on OutletName. ""It's been done a number of times. But primarily, it's been done to build facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq. In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, 'Where is the emergency?'""
Where is the emergency? We will answer that question. Pay attention to the following statistics, that, of course, the hate-Trump media, hate-Trump Democrats, are not telling you, that they're ignoring.
Now, in the past two years alone, criminal aliens have been responsible for approximately -- look at this number -- 235,000 violations of the law, including 4,000 homicides, 30,000 sex crimes and -- get this -- over 100,000 violent assaults. In just 2018, 17,000 individuals with criminal records were apprehended at the border.
And the crisis goes much, much deeper. In towns and cities all across the country, we know about the opioid crisis, 300 Americans are killed every single week from heroin; 90 percent of that heroin is flooding across our southern border. That death toll, by the way, is equal to -- think about this -- the number of American troops killed every week in Vietnam during the year 1968. That was the war's deadliest year.
And over a 10-year period, the total Americans killed from illegal drugs coming across the southern border will be nearly three times higher than the total number of U.S. troops killed in Vietnam. There is your crisis, by any definition.
For us and most Americans, this is not a political game. We are seeing this is as about life and death. This is about innocent, brave, law-abiding Americans and legal immigrants literally dying because our borders are not secure.
But don't expect to see this on any other network. Of course, Donald Trump wants something, and they are just against it. Instead of reporting facts and truths, they seem content with just trashing Trump voters, blaming us for seeing the truth. Over on fake news OutletName, commentator Rick Wilson first trashed Trump supporters, suggesting that we didn't have teeth. Now, he's saying we are not sophisticated enough; we're not smart enough to understand the issue involving border security.
And while fake news OutletName insults our intelligence, conspiracy-TV, MSOutletName, are referring to Americans - we the people - as cowards. Remember last week, when I was talking about how we have the hate-Trump media? And I told you about the information crisis? Personal attacks will never stop this show from reporting truths.
For us and most Americans, this is not a political game. We are seeing this is as about life and death. This is about innocent, brave, law-abiding Americans and legal immigrants literally dying because our borders are not secure.
Now, we know the story of Officer Ronil Singh. He was gunned down by an illegal immigrant just after Christmas. He was just put to rest this weekend. His 5-month-old son will never know his father. That's life and death.
And the person responsible for that heinous attack had a criminal track record. He should have been turned over to ICE. He should have been deported. But in California, they have sanctuary cities. The whole state is a sanctuary state, and those policies prevented that from happening. Government policies are now literally aiding and abetting lawbreaking and paving the way for future crimes. Why do you think the government would act and aid and abet criminals?
And like every other Democrat, you have the now-former governor of California, Jerry Brown, burying his head in the sand. But really, he ought to be taking responsibility. Sanctuary states literally prevent criminals that would normally have been handed over to ICE, from being being detained. It makes it illegal. That means they go free. What happened to Office Singh is all too common an occurrence.
Now, have you heard the name of Pierce Corcoran? On December 29, he was killed by a suspected illegal immigrant driving without a license, without insurance and on the wrong side of the highway. Pierce was only 22 years old.
The American people and the public need to start asking some really important, tough questions. How many of our fellow citizens have been murdered because of unsecured borders? Now, if that's not a national emergency, I don't know how we would ever define one.

HuffPost,"In a wide-ranging request for documents and analysis, President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team asked the Department of Homeland Security last month to assess all assets available for border wall and barrier construction.
The team also asked about the department’s capacity for expanding immigrant detention and about an aerial surveillance program that was scaled back by the Obama administration but remains popular with immigration hardliners. And it asked whether federal workers have altered biographic information kept by the department about immigrants out of concern for their civil liberties.
The requests were made in a Dec. 5 meeting between Trump’s transition team and Department of Homeland Security officials, according to an internal agency memo reviewed by OutletName. The document offers a glimpse into the president-elect’s strategy for securing the U.S. borders and reversing polices put in place by the Obama administration.
Trump’s transition team did not comment in response to OutletName inquiries. A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined to comment.
In response to the transition team request, U.S. Customs and Border Protection staffers identified more than 400 miles along the U.S.-Mexico border, and about the same distance along the U.S.-Canada border, where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by OutletName.
OutletName could not determine whether the Trump team is considering a northern border barrier. During the campaign, Trump pledged to build a wall and expand fencing on parts of the U.S.-Mexico border but said he sees no need to build a wall on the border with Canada.
One program the transition team asked about, according to the email summary, was Operation Phalanx, an aerial surveillance program that authorizes 1,200 Army National Guard airmen to monitor the southern border for drug trafficking and illegal migration.
The program once deployed 6,000 airmen under President George W. Bush but was downsized by Barack Obama, a move blasted by some conservatives who argue the surveillance is vital to border security.
POLICY SHIFT
The transition team also asked for copies of every executive order and directive sent to immigration agents since Obama took office in 2009, according to the memo summarizing the meeting.
Trump has said he intends to undo Obama’s executive actions on immigration, including a 2012 order to allow children brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents to remain in the country on temporary authorizations that allow them to attend college and work.
The program, known as DACA, collected information including participants’ addresses that could theoretically be used to locate and deport them if the policy is reversed. Another request of the transition team was for information about whether any migrant records have been changed for any reason, including for civil rights or civil liberties concerns, according to the internal memo seen by OutletName.
A Department of Homeland Security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agency interpreted the request to mean the transition team wanted to make sure that federal workers were not tampering with information to protect DACA recipients and other migrants from deportation.
On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to deport more undocumented immigrants, a promise that may have prompted the transition team’s request for information about the feasibility of expanding temporary detention facilities.
The internal memo summarizing the meeting between Trump’s transition team and U.S. Customs and Border protection said the team had requested a comprehensive picture of border security as well as resources available for walls and barriers.
The Department of Homeland Security official said agency representatives who attended the meeting believed the request to include both the northern and southern borders. U.S. Customs and Border Protection then prepared a report on specific locations and costs of building a fence along the U.S.-Canada border.
OutletName reviewed a copy of the report, which estimated the cost of building fencing along the northern border fence would be $3.3 billion and cover 452 miles along border of Canada and the states of Washington, Idaho, Montana, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.
Adding 413 miles of fencing on the southwest border would be more expensive, according to the estimate of $11.37 billion, because it would be aimed at keeping pedestrians as well as vehicles from crossing.
Pedestrian fences require more staff and would cost $11.2 million per mile versus $4.1 million per mile to build to build, according to the report.
In fiscal year 2015, the latest year for which data is available, border patrol agents apprehended 2,626 illegal migrants on the U.S.-Canada border compared to 331,333 apprehended on the U.S.-Mexico border.","in a wide - ranging request for documents and analysis, president - elect donald trump ’ s transition team asked the department of homeland security last month to assess all assets available for border wall and barrier construction. the team also asked about the department ’ s capacity for expanding immigrant detention and about an aerial surveillance program that was scaled back by the obama administration but remains popular with immigration hardliners. and it asked whether federal workers have altered biographic information kept by the department about immigrants out of concern for their civil liberties. the requests were made in a dec. 5 meeting between trump ’ s transition team and department of homeland security officials, according to an internal agency memo reviewed by outletname. the document offers a glimpse into the president - elect ’ s strategy for securing the u. s. borders and reversing polices put in place by the obama administration. trump ’ s transition team did not comment in response to outletname inquiries. a spokeswoman for the department of homeland security and u. s. customs and border protection declined to comment. in response to the transition team request, u. s. customs and border protection staffers identified more than 400 miles along the u. s. - mexico border, and about the same distance along the u. s. - canada border, where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by outletname. outletname could not determine whether the trump team is considering a northern border barrier. during the campaign, trump pledged to build a wall and expand fencing on parts of the u. s. - mexico border but said he sees no need to build a wall on the border with canada. one program the transition team asked about, according to the email summary, was operation phalanx, an aerial surveillance program that authorizes 1, 200 army national guard airmen to monitor the southern border for drug trafficking and illegal migration. the program once deployed 6, 000 airmen under president george w. bush but was downsized by barack obama, a move blasted by some conservatives who argue the surveillance is vital to border security. policy shift the transition team also asked for copies of every executive order and directive sent to immigration agents since obama took office in 2009, according to the memo summarizing the meeting. trump has said he intends to undo obama ’ s executive actions on immigration, including a 2012 order to allow children brought to the u. s. illegally by their parents to remain in the country on temporary authorizations that allow them to attend college and work. the program, known as daca, collected information",0.0301932301372289,0.469806730747222,1,430,2.33,2.56,9.07,2.33,0.47,6.28,6.98,2.09,1.63,0.93,0.0,0.0,2.33,0.0,0.23,0.0,0.23,0.0,14.65,0.23,0.0,0.23,0.47,0.0,0.0,6.74,0.23,0.0,0.47,0.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.93,10.7,0.7,9.53,0.47,0.0,0.0,1.63,5.12,1.16,0.0,6.511627906976744,5.5813953488372094,1.627906976744186
HuffPost,"Democrats took back the House on Thursday, electing Nancy Pelosi to be speaker and quickly passing legislation to reopen closed government agencies. But those efforts to end the shutdown are going nowhere fast, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowing to block the bill and President Donald Trump saying he would veto it.
The partial government shutdown is about to hit its two-week anniversary, and even with Democrats now controlling one chamber of Congress, there’s no sign of any deal.
Democrats are more determined than ever not to give Trump a single dollar for his border wall, and Trump hasn’t moved off his full request of $5.6 billion for construction of some kind of physical barrier. (There’s an ongoing semantics battle over “border security,” “steel slats,” “fencing,” and a “wall” that could ultimately be key to ending the shutdown.)
There’s also the possibility that lawmakers return to an old deal, trading wall money for an extension of the Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals immigration program. Sean Hannity, a close confidant of the president, floated that idea on his TV show Thursday night, but Democrats have also said they now wouldn’t accept that deal, partly because they don’t trust Trump to hold up his end of the bargain.
A DACA deal still could be the way out of the shutdown, if Democrats decided to trust Trump. Democratic and Republican congressional leaders are set to attend another White House meeting with Trump on Friday. If past meetings are any indication, however, everyone will walk away from the meeting firmer in their resolve not to give an inch.On Thursday, House Democrats passed two bills that would end the shutdown: a roughly month-long extension for the Department of Homeland Security that would allow both sides to continue negotiating on a wall, and another larger bill that would fund all shuttered agencies until October.
The short-term bill for DHS passed the House 239-192, with five Republicans breaking ranks to join all Democrats in support of the bill.
The House also passed a bill to reopen the handful of other unfunded agencies. That bill passed 241-190, with seven Republicans joining Democrats to vote yes.
The Republican defections ― contrasted with Democratic unity ― are the first signs of the GOP cracking under the pressure of the shutdown.
Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who’s up for re-election in 2020 in his increasingly blue state, also said Thursday that he supports passing a continuing resolution to reopen the government.
But aside from a few Republicans, the GOP is digging in. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) ― a member who speaks with Trump on a regular basis ― told OutletName on Thursday that the shutdown wouldn’t end until Democrats approved wall money. “I mean, there’s a wall between Tijuana and San Diego, right? If it’s so bad or immoral as they say, you’d think they’d be willing to tear them down,” Jordan said.
Jordan is unlikely to vote for any proposal that doesn’t include Trump’s full request, but one of the byproducts of Democrats taking back the House is that Jordan’s vote is irrelevant. As Democrats proved Thursday night, they have the votes to reopen the government. They just need the Senate to act and the president to sign it ― two things that remain unlikely.
McConnell once again vowed Thursday not to bring up the House-passed legislation, calling the bills that passed the Senate unanimously two weeks ago a “waste of time.” He says he won’t allow a vote on anything “that does not have a real chance of passing this chamber and getting a presidential signature.”
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed Thursday not to bring up the House-passed legislation.
Leaving aside whether a bill that passed unanimously two weeks ago doesn’t have a real chance of passing, the House and Senate could always override Trump’s veto, but that would require a significant number of Republicans to break ranks ― more than two dozen in the Senate and around 50 in the House.
Politically, that’s a tall order for the GOP, a party that seems to value fealty to Trump above all else.
But the realities of the shutdown are just starting to hit. There are roughly 400,000 federal workers who have been furloughed, and another 400,000 who are simply working without pay. If the shutdown stretches on for another week ― looking more likely by the day ― it will be the longest government shutdown in history, over a $5 billion dispute in a $4.4 trillion budget.
For Democrats, however, the wall has become much more than a line item. It’s almost a representation of Trump’s entire legacy, all of his policies and empty promises. Democrats don’t want to give in to Trump on that, particularly after his negotiating style has been to just demand that Democrats give him what he wants.","democrats took back the house on thursday, electing nancy pelosi to be speaker and quickly passing legislation to reopen closed government agencies. but those efforts to end the shutdown are going nowhere fast, with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell vowing to block the bill and president donald trump saying he would veto it. the partial government shutdown is about to hit its two - week anniversary, and even with democrats now controlling one chamber of congress, there ’ s no sign of any deal. democrats are more determined than ever not to give trump a single dollar for his border wall, and trump hasn ’ t moved off his full request of $ 5. 6 billion for construction of some kind of physical barrier.

ICE said that officers lodged an immigration detainer on July 16, but that by Aug. 8 the jail failed to honor it and let the 20-year-old go after he posted bail. “It is real slap in the face to the victim's friends and family when criminal aliens, in this case a man who has caused the death of a woman and severe injuries to her husband, are released into the community due to dangerous sanctuary policies,” Nathalie Asher, Seattle field office director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, said in a statement. “How many lives have to be lost before politicians are more concerned about public safety than their own political agendas?” ICE said that according to a Washington County Sherriff’s Department news alert, investigators learned on Aug. 27 that Maldonado-Hernandez fled to Mexico to avoid prosecution. The 20-year-old remains at large, federal officials said. Three people accused of helping him flee to Mexico – Ernesto Garcia, 20, Alicia Scardina, 21 and Luis Maldonado-Hernandez, 28 – were arrested the following day on charges of hindering prosecution, FOX12 Oregon reported at the time. Federal officials contend that under the law, ICE has the authority to lodge immigration detainers with law enforcement partners who have custody of individuals arrested on criminal charges and who ICE has probable cause to believe are removable. ""The detainer form asks the other law enforcement agency to notify ICE in advance of release and to maintain custody of the alien for a brief period of time so that ICE can take custody of that person in a safe and secure setting upon release from that agency’s custody,"" the agency states. ""Yet, across the United States, several jurisdictions refuse to honor detainers and instead choose to willingly release criminal offenders back into their local communities where they are free to offend."" Officials, however, have pointed out that jails in Oregon can't recognize civil detainers because of a 2014 federal court decision that found Clackamas County violated a woman's rights by holding her beyond her release date while federal authorities investigated her immigration status. The Washington County Sheriff's Office told FOX12 on Tuesday that ICE detainers are ""simply put,"" not lawful or enforceable and that “had ICE agents provided a valid warrant or order signed by a federal judge during that time, Mr. Maldonado-Hernandez would have remained in custody.” “The continuing refusal of ICE agents to provide necessary legal justification for holding people they believe are a danger to our community is the real problem, not the sheriff's office insistence on following state law,” the sheriff's office told FOX12. ICE previously said it's turned to courthouses to arrest immigrants who qualify for deportation because local policies have prevented county jails and state prisons from cooperating to allow wanted individuals to be transferred to the custody of immigration officials. A new rule enacted earlier this month by Oregon Supreme Court Chief Justice Martha Walters forbids ICE agents from arresting immigrants inside or near the state's courthouses unless the agents first receive warrants from a judge. Patrick Ator and his wife were married for 57 years and were ""totally happy"" up until the deadly crash. 
“When it was all over, I woke up and looked over at my wife. She wasn’t talking,"" he told FOX12 on Tuesday. ""I felt her pulse and there was no pulse. In my head I said, ‘Lord, why don’t you take me too?’” Former ICE acting director and OutletName contributor Tom Homan sounds off on officials putting politics over safety. His daughter, Deborah Goldstein, said her parents' relationship was described by people as ""one of the best marriages they’ve ever seen."" “She was a great mother, an incredible mother and a lot of fun to be with,” Goldstein said Tuesday. Ator and Goldstein told FOX12 that the debate over the law and jurisdiction of the two law enforcement agencies is beyond them, and they’re still just trying to heal four months after the deadly crash. “I worry that they will get away with too little, but at the same time, that’s beyond me,"" Ator said. ""My wife and I lost our togetherness and that’s really what I’m concentrating on. I don’t worry about the people that caused it.""","a 20 - year - old man in the country illegally who was street - racing when he crashed into a car in oregon, killing a woman, was able to flee to mexico after local authorities did not honor an immigration detainer, according to federal officials. u. s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) said in a news release on tuesday that alejandro maldonado - hernandez was arrested on july 12 in connection with the fatal car crash that killed janice ator and seriously injured her husband, patrick ator. after he was released from the hospital with minor injuries, maldonado - hernandez was booked into the washington county jail on charges of felony manslaughter in the second degree, felony assault in the third degree and misdemeanor reckless driving. ice said that officers lodged an immigration detainer on july 16, but that by aug. 8 the jail failed to honor it and let the 20 - year - old go after he posted bail. “ it is real slap in the face to the victim's friends and family when criminal aliens, in this case a man who has caused the death of a woman and severe injuries to her husband, are released into the community due to dangerous sanctuary policies, ” nathalie asher, seattle field office director for ice ’ s enforcement and removal operations, said in a statement. “ how many lives have to be lost before politicians are more concerned about public safety than their own political agendas? ” ice said that according to a washington county sherriff ’ s department news alert, investigators learned on aug. 27 that maldonado - hernandez fled to mexico to avoid prosecution. the 20 - year - old remains at large, federal officials said. three people accused of helping him flee to mexico – ernesto garcia, 20, alicia scardina, 21 and luis maldonado - hernandez, 28 – were arrested the following day on charges of hindering prosecution, fox12 oregon reported at the time. federal officials contend that under the law, ice has the authority to lodge immigration detainers with law enforcement partners who have custody of individuals arrested on criminal charges and who ice has probable cause to believe are removable.

FoxNews,"A third person living in the United States under an Obama-era protection for illegal immigrants who entered the country as minors was arrested this week for allegedly trying to smuggle Mexican nationals into the U.S.
U.S. Border Patrol said agents in Arizona nabbed the 26-year-old man, who is a Mexican national and a beneficiary of the 2012 Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals executive order, after spotting footprints from four people who had crossed the border near the Colorado River on Monday.
Officials said they soon discovered the four people getting into a white Ford F-150 in a nearby citrus grove.
The vehicle was pulled over and the driver, who now lives in Salinas, Calif., was identified as a DACA recipient, authorities said. The four other occupants were identified as Mexican nationals who were in the U.S. illegally.
Border Patrol said the unidentified driver was arrested on human smuggling charges while the four passengers were arrested for immigration violations. The vehicle was seized for forfeiture.
Monday's incident was at least the third human smuggling-related arrest this week in which agents nabbed a so-called ""Dreamer.""
Border Patrol officials said two Dreamers -- one in the country legally under the DACA program and the other whose permission had expired -- were arrested last week in separate incidents in California.
One arrest occurred last Wednesday near Torrey Pines State Beach while the other happened in Campo, Calif. Both suspects are in custody. Officials did not indicate the three men were linked to each other in any way.
The arrests come while Congressional lawmakers try to write legislation to give the DACA recipients legal status.

Breitbart,"OutletName News’ Border/Cartel Chronicles Director Brandon Darby slammed the spending resolution passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump last week, calling the measure a betrayal to supporters of increased border security. His comments came during an interview on OutletName News Tonight.
Darby explained that due to a provision in the spending bill Trump signed on Friday, it is “almost going to be impossible to deport” migrants who cross the border from Mexico “if they have a minor with them.”
“It’s going to be impossible to allow them to self-deport; it’s going to be impossible,” Darby told SiriusXM host Rebecca Mansour on Friday. “[Trump] really should have sought broader counsel before he signed it, and he didn’t.”
LISTEN:
Darby minced no words in his criticism of the president’s decision to sign the bill: “He screwed the pooch.”
Mansour laid out the problematic provision in the new law that Darby said makes it impossible to deport the migrants who arrive with a child, explaining that it “says basically, if you come with a child you cannot be deported — by child we mean anybody under the age of 18. This is basically telling human traffickers to attach a child to your migrant caravan and say that everybody that’s with that child is a family member, and you get in.”
Mansour said this provision puts the status even more plainly in the law. “Now, it’s literally in the law that if you have a child, you are not deported.” She called the new law “deportation Kryptonite.”
“This seems to be a total lure for human traffickers,” Mansour continued.
“We have to understand,” Darby responded. “There are a lot of bad people who cross that border. It is not a safe place. It is a very dangerous place in some areas.”
Darby cited a March 2014 article that reported the deportation of more than 7,000 sex offenders from Texas alone during a three-year period. More than a quarter of those committed sex offenses against children.
Darby wrote in the article about “a more concerning possibility — the sex offenders illegally entering the U.S. through the porous U.S./Mexico border are possibly being deported and coming right back to offend again.”
“What I am pointing out,” Darby continued in the radio interview, “is that there are thousands of bad people coming into our country — tens of thousands of good people — but thousands of bad people. All they have to do is kidnap a baby and they get to live in the United States now. That’s all they have to do, is show up with a kidnapped baby. We have no way to prove it — we’re not DNA testing, we have no way to prove it.”
“That is what we have just done, as a nation,” Darby stated. “That is what President Trump and our GOP, aside from some who voted against it–that is what they have just done to this nation.”
He went on to explain that the President codified “the worst things that inspire and encourage people to come to our border–the worst pull factors possible.”
During the interview, Darby also discussed the historical corruption of South Texas border county officials who now have veto power over the administration’s ability to build barriers in certain sections of the Rio Grande Valley Sector. Further, he discussed with Americans for Limited Government’s Rick Manning about the constitutional impact of a state like Texas declaring a state of emergency and the federal government’s constitutionally required response.
Darby also slammed the Trump Administration’s failure to take effective action against Mexican drug cartels–particularly the Gulf Cartel–which he stated derives substantial revenue from the smuggling of human beings into South Texas.
“I think Barack Obama did a better job of going after Mexican cartels than the Trump Administration has done,” Darby expressed. “There’s just no way to put lipstick on this pig. He screwed the pooch, and we’re in trouble.”
Darby’s entire interview with Rebecca Mansour and Rick Manning is available online. OutletName News Tonight airs on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9 p.m. to midnight Eastern.

FoxNews,"A Massachusetts judge and court officer accused of helping an illegal immigrant flee an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent waiting to take him into custody were indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury for obstruction of justice and three other counts, officials said. Newton District Court Judge Shelley M. Richmond Joseph and the court officer, identified in court documents as Wesley MacGregor, face several charges stemming from an April 2, 2018 incident in which the pair allegedly helped Jose Medina-Perez get out of the courthouse via a back door in order to elude the ICE agent who sought Medina-Perez. “This case is about the rule of law. The allegations in today’s indictment involve obstruction by a sitting judge, that is intentional interference with the enforcement of federal law, and that is a crime,"" U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Andrew Lelling said Thursday. Joseph and MacGregor were both charged with obstruction of justice, aiding and abetting; obstruction of a federal proceeding, aiding and abetting and conspiracy to obstruct justice, Lelling said. MacGregor was also charged with perjury before a federal grand jury. Joseph, who has been suspended without pay, and MacGregor appeared in court Thursday and pleaded not guilty to all counts.  No date has been set for their next court appearance. ""As public servants, all of the officers in the court make a promise — a promise to serve the people’s interest above all else. Today we know this promise has been broken,” said Peter Fitzhugh, special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations in Boston, who led the investigation. Medina-Perez, a twice-deported illegal immigrant with a fugitive warrant for drunken driving in Pennsylvania, had been in Joseph's courtroom in order to be arraigned on drug charges, the Boston Globe previously reported. Medina-Perez was the subject of an ICE detainer -- a written request to hold an individual wanted for deportation for up to 48 hours -- and an ICE agent was waiting in the lobby of the courthouse to detain Medina-Perez after the arraignment, officials said. But during the hearing, Joseph asked Medina-Perez’s attorney “ICE is going to get him?,” according to courtroom recordings obtained by the Boston Globe in December and released in court documents Thursday. Medina-Perez's lawyer was also heard telling Joseph “ICE will pick him up if he walks out the front door. But I think the best thing for us to do is clear the fugitive issue and release him on a personal, and hope that he can avoid ICE...That's the best I can do.” “What if we detain him?"" the judge asked before requesting the clerk to turn off the courtroom’s audio recorder, leaving nearly a minute unrecorded.

Richmond Joseph and a former court officer on obstruction of justice for allegedly helping a man in the country illegally evade immigration officials as he left the courthouse after a hearing. (AP) Minutes later, Medina-Perez's attorney said his client ""has some property downstairs"" and needed to speak to an interpreter, which Joseph allowed. MacGregor then used his security access card to escort Medina-Perez out of the courthouse without being seen by the ICE agent, officials said. ""With the recorder off, defendant Joseph and the Defense Attorney discussed devising a way to have A.S. [Medina-Perez] avoid being arrested by the ICE officer,"" court documents stated. The ICE agent continued to wait in the lobby not knowing the illegal immigrant already left the building, Lelling said, adding Joseph lied about the incident to her superiors when asked about it. ""The people of this country deserve nothing less than to know that their appointed and elected representatives are working on their behalf, while adhering to and enforcing the rule of law, not a personal agenda,"" Fitzhugh said. ""The special agents of Homeland Security Investigations remain committed to upholding our promise to the public, without compromise.” Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement the indictment ""is a radical and politically-motivated attack on our state and the independence of our courts."" ""It is a bedrock principle of our constitutional system that federal prosecutors should not recklessly interfere with the operation of state courts and their administration of justice,"" she continued. ""This matter could have been appropriately handled by the Commission on Judicial Conduct and the Trial Court. I am deeply disappointed by U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling’s misuse of prosecutorial resources and the chilling effect his actions will have.” Joseph was appointed Newton District judge by Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker in 2017 after several years serving as a criminal defense attorney and a prosecutor, the Boston Globe reported. After reports of Joseph’s alleged intervention emerged in December, Baker told reporters he believed Joseph should be benched while the incident was investigated. ""I don't believe she should be hearing criminal cases until that federal case is resolved,"" Baker said about Joseph. ""Look, judges are not supposed to be in the business of obstructing justice. And as far as I can tell, based on the facts as they were presented, she clearly violated the court's own policies with respect to the way they're supposed to handle continuance and involve federal immigration enforcement."" Medina-Perez’s freedom was short-lived. He was arrested a month later after the court hearing and again let go, this time by an immigration judge who freed him on bond, the Boston Globe reported. That case is currently pending, officials said. The 38-year-old native of the Dominican Republic had been previously deported in January 2003 and June 2007, ICE said.

HuffPost,"President Donald Trump sent senators a lengthy set of demands on Friday that could tank a deal to help Dreamers ― young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children ― and might risk a government funding agreement in the process.
The document is essentially a immigration restrictionist wish list. It calls for a border wall, more immigration enforcement agents, punishment for so-called “sanctuary cities,” restrictions on citizens and legal residents sponsoring family members’ visas, and policies that make it easier to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. No dollar amounts were included in the list of demands, but OutletName reported earlier Friday that Trump is seeking nearly $18 billion to pay for a border wall.
Democrats and immigrant rights activists have said they won’t accept the White House’s demands in a deal to grant legal status to Dreamers, hundreds of thousands of whom are at risk of losing deportation protections because Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA program.
The list could be enough to trigger a Democratic revolt on a government funding bill that needs to pass later this month, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), whose office shared the White House’s list with reporters, said in a statement.
“President Trump has said he may need a good government shutdown to get his wall,” Durbin said. “With this demand, he seems to be heading in that direction. ... It’s outrageous that the White House would undercut months of bipartisan efforts by again trying to put its entire wish-list of hardline anti-immigrant bills—plus an additional $18 billion in wall funding—on the backs of these young people.”
Trump ended DACA in September and said that Congress should act to give more permanent protections to recipients of the two-year work permits and deportation relief. DACA recipients will begin to lose permits in greater numbers in March, although activists estimate that they’re already losing them at a rate of about 122 per day.
In the months since Trump ended the program, the White House has put out long lists of immigration priorities, and Trump has made broad pronouncements in public comments and tweets, largely focused around building a wall, ending the diversity visa lottery and eliminating so-called “chain migration,” immigration restrictionists’ preferred term for family reunification visas.
The list of demands was initially created in October, with Stephen Miller, a Trump policy adviser, listed as the author of the document, according to the properties on the PDF file. But senators didn’t get a copy until Friday.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the document.
Democrats have said they are willing to give Trump some of what he wants on border security, such as more infrastructure, technology and funds, in exchange for legal status for Dreamers. But they, and Dreamers themselves, have argued any deal must be proportional — not everything Republicans want in exchange for legal status for one subset of the undocumented population. During comprehensive immigration reform efforts in 2013, for example, Democrats agreed to an overhaul of the legal immigration system, border security measures and enforcement as part of a package that would have also granted a path to legal status and eventual citizenship for much of the undocumented immigrant population.
Democrats, activists and even some Republicans have warned that piling on more immigration issues has the potential to sink a deal — that’s what has happened during past reform efforts and could again now.
The document the White House sent to senators on Friday could indicate the administration either thinks it can get Democrats to settle because of their desire to help Dreamers, or that it doesn’t really want a deal at all.
I am not a bargaining chip for Stephen Miller’s vendetta against brown and black people. Offering up my safety in exchange for the suffering of immigrant families is sick and we won’t stand for it. Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for United We Dream
The demands include ending the diversity visa lottery and limiting refugee intake, as well as allowing citizens and legal permanent residents to sponsor only minor children and spouses for green cards ― shutting out the ability to bring over adult children or siblings. Trump has disparaged both the diversity visa lottery and “chain migration” as dangerous by citing two terror incidents allegedly perpetrated by people who entered through those programs, although there is no evidence there is a greater risk of terror by immigrants with those visas.
The White House also asked for funds to hire 10,000 additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and to give local police more authority to assist with deportation efforts. Another priority is to more easily penalize “sanctuary cities,” the loose term for jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with immigration enforcement, often because they view it as bad for community policing or because of constitutional concerns.
The list also includes changing policies for people seeking asylum and for unaccompanied children apprehended at the border, restricting relief and making it easier to quickly deport them. It would also mandate E-Verify, a system that allows employers to check immigration status of would-be hires, something that both some business interests and advocates oppose because there currently is no pathway for many undocumented immigrants in the U.S. to get status and some industries say they can’t find enough willing legal workers.
The White House is hosting a bipartisan group for immigration discussions next week, and separate discussions between a group of Senate Republicans and Democrats continue. It’s not yet clear whether Democrats will insist that a Dreamer deal be part of a government funding package — Durbin and other members of the party voted against a short-term bill in December because of the issue and likely would again, but other Democrats might vote with Republicans for fear of being blamed for a shutdown.
Immigrant rights activists said Friday that they are confident that Democratic leaders are committed to getting a Dreamer bill passed ― and that they wouldn’t acquiesce to a deal that grants legal status to young people while hurting the rest of the undocumented population.","president donald trump sent senators a lengthy set of demands on friday that could tank a deal to help dreamers ― young undocumented immigrants who came to the u. s. as children ― and might risk a government funding agreement in the process. the document is essentially a immigration restrictionist wish list. it calls for a border wall, more immigration enforcement agents, punishment for so - called “ sanctuary cities, ” restrictions on citizens and legal residents sponsoring family members ’ visas, and policies that make it easier to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. no dollar amounts were included in the list of demands, but outletname reported earlier friday that trump is seeking nearly $ 18 billion to pay for a border wall. democrats and immigrant rights activists have said they won ’ t accept the white house ’ s demands in a deal to grant legal status to dreamers, hundreds of thousands of whom are at risk of losing deportation protections because trump ended the deferred action for childhood arrivals or daca program. the list could be enough to trigger a democratic revolt on a government funding bill that needs to pass later this month, senate minority whip dick durbin ( d - ill. ), whose office shared the white house ’ s list with reporters, said in a statement. “ president trump has said he may need a good government shutdown to get his wall, ” durbin said. “ with this demand, he seems to be heading in that direction.... it ’ s outrageous that the white house would undercut months of bipartisan efforts by again trying to put its entire wish - list of hardline anti - immigrant bills — plus an additional $ 18 billion in wall funding — on the backs of these young people. ” trump ended daca in september and said that congress should act to give more permanent protections to recipients of the two - year work permits and deportation relief. daca recipients will begin to lose permits in greater numbers in march, although activists estimate that they ’ re already losing them at a rate of about 122 per day. in the months since trump ended the program, the white house has put out long lists of immigration priorities, and trump has made broad pronouncements in public comments and tweets, largely focused around building a wall, ending the diversity visa lottery and eliminating so - called “ chain migration, ” immigration restrictionists ’ preferred term for family reunification visas. the list of demands was initially created in october, with stephen miller, a trump policy adviser, listed as the author of the document, according to the",0.999979853630065,0.499979835969498,1,415,1.93,5.54,8.67,1.2,1.93,5.54,6.51,0.48,1.69,2.17,1.69,0.0,0.96,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.16,0.48,0.0,0.0,0.72,0.0,1.2,2.89,1.69,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.48,1.93,9.88,1.69,6.99,0.96,0.0,0.0,6.02,5.06,2.17,1.45,6.265060240963856,10.120481927710843,1.2048192771084338
HuffPost,"In a primetime televised address Tuesday, President Donald Trump repeated his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall money in order to end the nearly three-week federal government shutdown, offering the deal as the only solution to solve a major national security crisis.
“This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It’s also what our professionals at the border want and need,” Trump said, describing the impasse as a “choice between right and wrong, between justice and injustice.”
But the only thing resembling a crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border isn’t an existential threat to national security ― it’s the question of how to handle a historically high number of Central American families and children coming into the country, many of whom are asking for asylum or some other humanitarian relief from deportation.
The White House position on the issue is clear: Trump wants to either indefinitely detain the Central American migrants or cast them back to Mexico. But the wall won’t achieve either of those aims. Instead, the ploy harkens back to the symbolic solution to a largely fabricated crisis that paved Trump’s way to the presidency back in 2016.
There was no border crisis when Trump launched his campaign in the summer of 2015, promising to wall off the Southern border. Instead, unauthorized crossings stood at their lowest levels since the 1970s. By the numbers, there’s still no crisis ― the unauthorized population of the United States has remained flat for more than a decade.What has changed in recent years is that more of the migrants who do cross without authorization are Central American asylum seekers ― often traveling together as families or unaccompanied minors. That trend, which began in the summer of 2014, predates Trump. But since he took office, the number of Central American families crossing has risen to historic highs.
In 2010, just 10 percent of all migrants apprehended by Border Patrol were families and unaccompanied children ― instead, most were single men. As of November 2018, families and unaccompanied children make up 57 percent of those apprehended.
The Trump administration has constantly rehauled the immigration enforcement system to scare off the migrant families and children. But none of it ― “zero tolerance” prosecutions for petty immigration offenses, a six-week experiment with systematic family separation, the mobilization of the National Guard and U.S. military, a court-enjoined policy barring migrants from asking for asylum ― have stopped them from arriving.
That trend isn’t particularly surprising. The three countries sending by far the most migrants since 2014 ― Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras ― all face extreme poverty and some of the highest homicide rates in the world.
And now, Trump’s focus on the wall and several policy changes have led to humanitarian problems of his own making.
With legal ports of entry largely blocked, many migrants find smugglers to take them on dangerous journeys through mountains and deserts to remote Border Patrol stations far away from medical services.
Customs and Border Protection officers are only letting between 30 and 90 people a day through legal ports of entry. As a result of that “metering” policy, thousands of migrants are waiting for weeks or months in shelters near the border, which in some cases are outdoor camps with limited access to clean water or large enclosed facilities where disease can easily spread.
With legal ports of entry largely blocked, many migrants find smugglers to take them on dangerous journeys through mountains and deserts to remote Border Patrol stations far away from medical services. The number of parents and children traveling through the El Paso sector, which includes a large swath of the Chihuahuan Desert, has risen by more than 1,500 percent over the past year. The number of border deaths has likewise increased.
If they reach the U.S., families and kids traveling by themselves are put in overcrowded Border Patrol stations that are struggling to deal with the influx of migrants. The Washington Post reported that in recent weeks, agents have been bringing dozens of sick migrants to clinics and hospitals. Last month, two children died while in Border Patrol custody.
In June, Trump implemented a new sponsor vetting policy that has forced children to languish for up to six months in long-term shelters. (In December, the administration rolled back some of the requirements for its vetting policy.) The number of unaccompanied children detained in government custody is at a record high.","in a primetime televised address tuesday, president donald trump repeated his demand for $ 5. 7 billion in border wall money in order to end the nearly three - week federal government shutdown, offering the deal as the only solution to solve a major national security crisis. “ this barrier is absolutely critical to border security. it ’ s also what our professionals at the border want and need, ” trump said, describing the impasse as a “ choice between right and wrong, between justice and injustice. ” but the only thing resembling a crisis on the u. s. - mexico border isn ’ t an existential threat to national security ― it ’ s the question of how to handle a historically high number of central american families and children coming into the country, many of whom are asking for asylum or some other humanitarian relief from deportation. the white house position on the issue is clear : trump wants to either indefinitely detain the central american migrants or cast them back to mexico. but the wall won ’ t achieve either of those aims. instead, the ploy harkens back to the symbolic solution to a largely fabricated crisis that paved trump ’ s way to the presidency back in 2016. there was no border crisis when trump launched his campaign in the summer of 2015, promising to wall off the southern border. instead, unauthorized crossings stood at their lowest levels since the 1970s. by the numbers, there ’ s still no crisis ― the unauthorized population of the united states has remained flat for more than a decade. what has changed in recent years is that more of the migrants who do cross without authorization are central american asylum seekers ― often traveling together as families or unaccompanied minors. that trend, which began in the summer of 2014, predates trump. but since he took office, the number of central american families crossing has risen to historic highs. in 2010, just 10 percent of all migrants apprehended by border patrol were families and unaccompanied children ― instead, most were single men. as of november 2018, families and unaccompanied children make up 57 percent of those apprehended. the trump administration has constantly rehauled the immigration enforcement system to scare off the migrant families and children. but none of it ― “ zero tolerance ” prosecutions for petty immigration offenses, a six - week experiment with systematic family separation, the mobilization of the national guard and u. s. military, a court - enjoined policy barring migrants from asking for asylum ― have stopped them from arriving. that trend",0.999971747398376,0.499971746432493,1,413,3.63,5.57,6.78,2.18,1.45,3.15,8.72,1.45,1.45,0.73,1.94,0.24,4.12,0.0,0.24,0.24,0.0,0.0,9.2,1.69,0.0,0.0,0.97,0.0,0.24,0.97,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,2.18,12.59,1.69,10.65,0.24,0.0,0.0,5.33,3.15,2.42,0.48,7.506053268765134,9.927360774818402,2.663438256658596
CNN,"A frustrated Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to say by the end of next month if it will hear arguments on whether it can wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children from deportation.
Such action could mean the court hears oral arguments and issues a decision in the middle of the 2020 presidential election.
As things stand, lower courts have ruled against the administration's attempts to rescind the program and issued a nationwide injunction that keeps it on the books, and the Supreme Court has not acted upon a longstanding request from the Justice Department to take up the issue.

FoxNews,"President Trump may have lost the early legal skirmishes over his executive order on immigration, but in the end he will likely win. The overwhelming weight of history and the law is on his side. The president does have the authority to ban the entry of foreigners, as long as he has what is called a “rational basis” to believe they pose a threat to the nation’s security. He does, and his order is designed to accomplish precisely that. The seven nations targeted by Trump in his immigration ban were originally identified in an anti-terrorism law signed by President Obama. Unlike other Muslim-majority nations that have a history of terrorism, these seven countries do not assist the U.S. in providing background checks and other vetting of immigrant applicants. Thus, it is not only “rational” to deny entry, it is imperative for the safety of Americans. The U.S. does not have the resources to properly vet all these individuals on its own. Shortly after the executive order was put in place, several federal court judges issued temporary restraining orders. Most of those TROs halted the detention and deportation of foreigners who had already been issued legal immigration visas.  Many had already arrived in the U.S. But that is a very small part of the president’s order. The merits of those TROs, not to mention the president’s order itself, have yet to be fully litigated.  The judicial rulings were issued “ex parte”.  That is, only one side was represented in court.  The Trump administration lawyers haven’t even been given a chance to appear in court to say, “good morning, your honor.” All of that may change once both sides are represented in court. The Washington State Case The ruling in Seattle by U.S. District Court Judge James Robart was different and far more expansive.  He issued a temporary hold on the immigration ban nationwide. Lawyers at the Department of Justice appealed to the 9th Circuit which refused to overturn Judge Robart’s ruling, although further briefs have been filed. Thereafter, the 9th Circuit could revisit its decision. It is no surprise that the 9th Circuit got it wrong.  It is the most overturned appellate court in the nation.  There’s a joke among California lawyers: if you lose your case in the 9th Circuit, you’re assured of winning it before the Supreme Court.  Get the picture? Nevertheless, the Seattle ruling is the case to watch, in part because Washington became the first state to sue. Take a look at judge Robart’s decision. It is largely devoid of any legal reasoning or sound analysis. Its brevity is exceeded only by its lack of logic as applied to the law. Absence of Standing to Sue             Washington State does not have “standing” to sue on behalf of its residents because they have suffered no ""actual harm"" from Trump's order. In order to sustain a lawsuit, the plaintiffs must demonstrate their alleged injury is direct and real, not merely hypothetical.  The harm must be imminent and irreparable, not speculative.  So how have Washington residents been harmed?  Lawyers for the state suggest their economy will be adversely impacted because the ban may prevent immigrants from working for Washington-based companies. Taxes might be reduced and its education system could be affected. However, all of that is pure conjecture.  It might happen, but it might not.  Hence, it does not constitute immediate “actual harm.” On that basis alone, the lawsuit should be dismissed.  Foreigners Do Not Enjoy Constitutional Rights   The vast majority of people affected by President Trump’s executive order are people who do not have legally valid immigration visas but are seeking entry to the United States by undertaking the lengthy application process. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people. The claim by Washington State that the immigration ban violates the First Amendment (freedom of religion) or the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments (equal protection clause) may seem, at first blush, like a reasonable argument.  Until you consider that our Constitution applies only to citizens and those on American soil. A man in Somalia may wish to invoke our Constitution to claim his freedom of religion is being infringed, but until he arrives here he enjoys none of its privileges and protections.  He has no right to assert discrimination, religious or otherwise.  And the state of Washington has no legal right to represent him in court.  It can only represent its own residents.  The President Has Authority to Dictate Immigration Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate immigration. In 1952, Congress passed a law empowering the president to deny entry into the U.S. to “any class of aliens” considered to be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.”  In other words, a threat to America and in the interests of national security. As I pointed out in a recent column, the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that Congress and the president have “plenary power” to regulate immigration.  For more than a century, the high court has consistently upheld such authority and rejected constitutional challenges to presidential action banning entire groups of foreigners.  Even the 9th Circuit has endorsed this legal principle.  Past presidents, including Carter and Obama, have issued orders similar to Trump’s. It is true that a subsequent 1965 immigration law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence. But that law says nothing about religion. And, more importantly, it applies only to the issuance of visas.  The president’s authority to deny entry to a large class of aliens is a broader power which supersedes individual visa considerations. Trump’s Executive Order Is Temporary Lost in all the legal tumult is the fact that President Trump’s executive order is only temporary: It applies for just 90 days for people in the seven designated countries that are sources of terrorism and 120 days for “refugees.” (The Syrian ban is “indefinite,” but that could change, too.) By the time each side has had the opportunity to fully litigate the merits of the various cases and undertaken the usual course of appeals, the executive order will likely have expired. That may render most of the cases moot. Absent a legal controversy, there would be nothing for judges to resolve. The petitions and lawsuits would probably be dismissed. For now, however, the Seattle case may head to a hearing before the full complement of judges on the 9th Circuit Court, known as an “en banc” session.  Or, the Department of Justice may seek an emergency application to the U.S. Supreme Court. The latter action might be imprudent, since the current court has only eight sitting justices. A 4-4 tie would allow the 9th Circuit’s decision to stand.  It would make more sense to wait for the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to cast the ninth, and perhaps deciding, vote. Given the great weight of the law in favor of the president, the decision should be unanimous. But why take the chance? Unwise To Attack a Federal Judge True to form, President Trump launched a Twitter attack on Judge Robart’s decision, calling him a “so-called judge” who issued a “ridiculous” decision. I agree, the decision is ridiculous to the extent it is based on scant legal analysis and completely contravenes long established law. Nevertheless, it is unwise and counterproductive to personally insult or demean a judge by questioning his legitimacy. Judges tend to be a collegial group. An attack on one may be viewed as an attack on all. Why create an underlying reason in the minds of appellate judges to find a way to support one of their brethren? A better strategy would be to compliment the Boston judge who affirmed Mr. Trump’s executive order. In a 21 page decision issued on February 3, Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton eloquently explains the power of the president embedded in sturdy constitutional principles. It is a thoughtful and comprehensive treatise on how our laws and the courts have spoken in unison on immigration authority. If any of these immigration cases ever reach the Supreme Court, Judge Gorton’s opinion may be the foundation for their decision.","president trump may have lost the early legal skirmishes over his executive order on immigration, but in the end he will likely win. the overwhelming weight of history and the law is on his side. the president does have the authority to ban the entry of foreigners, as long as he has what is called a “ rational basis ” to believe they pose a threat to the nation ’ s security. he does, and his order is designed to accomplish precisely that. the seven nations targeted by trump in his immigration ban were originally identified in an anti - terrorism law signed by president obama. unlike other muslim - majority nations that have a history of terrorism, these seven countries don't assist the u. s. in providing background checks and other vetting of immigrant applicants. thus, it is not only “ rational ” to deny entry, it is imperative for the safety of americans. the u. s. does not have the resources to properly vet all these individuals on its own. shortly after the executive order was put in place, several federal court judges issued temporary restraining orders. most of those tros halted the detention and deportation of foreigners who had already been issued legal immigration visas. many had already arrived in the u. s. but that is a very small part of the president ’ s order. the merits of those tros, not to mention the president ’ s order itself, have yet to be fully litigated. the judicial rulings were issued “ ex parte ”. that is, only one side was represented in court. the trump administration lawyers haven ’ t even been given a chance to appear in court to say, “ good morning, your honor. ” all of that may change once both sides are represented in court. the washington state case the ruling in seattle by u. s. district court judge james robart was different and far more expansive. he issued a temporary hold on the immigration ban nationwide. lawyers at the department of justice appealed to the 9th circuit which refused to overturn judge robart ’ s ruling, although further briefs have been filed. thereafter, the 9th circuit could revisit its decision. it is no surprise that the 9th circuit got it wrong. it is the most overturned appellate court in the nation. there ’ s a joke among california lawyers : if you lose your case in the 9th circuit, you ’ re assured of winning it before the supreme court. get the picture? nevertheless, the seattle ruling is the case to watch, in part because washington became the first state to sue. take a look at judge",0.0004119004879612,0.499588072299957,0,428,3.04,5.61,10.75,0.0,1.4,9.35,8.88,1.64,0.93,0.47,1.4,0.7,3.5,0.23,0.23,0.23,0.0,0.0,10.28,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.87,0.23,0.0,2.8,0.0,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.47,0.93,7.01,0.47,5.37,0.93,0.0,0.0,4.21,5.14,4.21,0.93,8.624708624708624,11.421911421911423,1.1655011655011656
HuffPost,"Pope Francis made a thinly veiled reference to President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall on Thursday, criticizing people who build walls instead of bridges.
The pontiff, who is visiting Panama for a global Catholic youth rally, didn’t explicitly mention Trump, but made it clear that he wants young members of his flock to be the kind of people who build bridges.
“These builders of walls that sow fear are looking to divide people and box them in,” the pope said during the opening ceremony of World Youth Day in Panama City.
“What do you want to be?” Francis asked the estimated 250,000 young people assembled for the rally.
“Builders of bridges,” his audience replied, according to a video of the ceremony published on YouTube by Vatican News.
Francis, the Catholic Church’s first Latin American pope, also praised the youth for joining together for the rally, even though they come from diverse cultures and speak many different languages.During his flight to Central America on Wednesday, Francis responded to a reporter’s question about the border wall by stating that the irrational fear of migration drives people “crazy.”
On Thursday, he urged Central American church leaders, dioceses and parishes to help the rest of society overcome its fears about migration by welcoming migrants.
“The Church, by virtue of her universality, can provide the fraternal hospitality and acceptance that can enable the communities of origin and of destination to dialogue and to help overcome fears and suspicions, and thus to consolidate the very bonds that migrations ― in the collective imagination ― threaten to break,” Francis said during a bishops’ meeting.Francis’ comments come during a partial government shutdown in the U.S. that was triggered by a dispute between Trump, who wants more than $5 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, and Democrats in Congress, who don’t want to allocate any new money for it. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has affected 800,000 federal workers.
Francis has made the plight of migrants and refugees one of the key issues of his papacy. In the past, he’s made many pronouncements on the morality of a border wall.
In 2016, while Trump was still a presidential candidate, Francis responded to a reporter’s question about Trump’s proposed border wall by suggesting that “a person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian.”
In 2017, days after Trump released the first iteration of a travel ban temporarily halting refugee admissions and blocking immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Francis issued another strong indictment of walls.
“In the social and civil context as well, I appeal not to create walls but to build bridges,” he said during a catechism lesson.","pope francis made a thinly veiled reference to president donald trump ’ s proposed border wall on thursday, criticizing people who build walls instead of bridges. the pontiff, who is visiting panama for a global catholic youth rally, didn ’ t explicitly mention trump, but made it clear that he wants young members of his flock to be the kind of people who build bridges. “ these builders of walls that sow fear are looking to divide people and box them in, ” the pope said during the opening ceremony of world youth day in panama city. “ what do you want to be? ” francis asked the estimated 250, 000 young people assembled for the rally. “ builders of bridges, ” his audience replied, according to a video of the ceremony published on youtube by vatican news. francis, the catholic church ’ s first latin american pope, also praised the youth for joining together for the rally, even though they come from diverse cultures and speak many different languages. during his flight to central america on wednesday, francis responded to a reporter ’ s question about the border wall by stating that the irrational fear of migration drives people “ crazy. ” on thursday, he urged central american church leaders, dioceses and parishes to help the rest of society overcome its fears about migration by welcoming migrants. “ the church, by virtue of her universality, can provide the fraternal hospitality and acceptance that can enable the communities of origin and of destination to dialogue and to help overcome fears and suspicions, and thus to consolidate the very bonds that migrations ― in the collective imagination ― threaten to break, ” francis said during a bishops ’ meeting. francis ’ comments come during a partial government shutdown in the u. s. that was triggered by a dispute between trump, who wants more than $ 5 billion for a u. s. - mexico border wall, and democrats in congress, who don ’ t want to allocate any new money for it. the shutdown, now in its fifth week, has affected 800, 000 federal workers. francis has made the plight of migrants and refugees one of the key issues of his papacy. in the past, he ’ s made many pronouncements on the morality of a border wall. in 2016, while trump was still a presidential candidate, francis responded to a reporter ’ s question about trump ’ s proposed border wall by suggesting that “ a person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not christian. ” in 2017, days after trump released the first iteration of a",0.999795973300933,0.499795925323269,1,419,2.86,3.34,5.25,2.86,0.72,1.67,9.07,1.67,2.63,1.43,1.19,0.0,2.39,0.0,1.19,0.95,0.0,0.0,17.9,0.24,0.0,0.24,1.67,0.0,0.0,1.91,0.48,2.86,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,8.59,0.95,7.88,0.24,0.0,0.0,5.01,3.34,3.1,1.19,5.011933174224343,8.353221957040573,0.23866348448687352

Daily Caller,"Border Patrol agents know exactly what they want in a border wall, and every mile varies.
Immigration experts tell OutletName that President Donald Trump’s vision for a border barrier is informed directly by the requests of Border Patrol agents.
Trump tweeted one day before the partial government shutdown that he was looking into building a “steel slat barrier” that is “totally effective.” The tweet sparked endless media stories and mockery about how Trump was backing down on his campaign promise of a concrete border wall.
A design of our Steel Slat Barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful!
“Whatever you want to call it, it’s all the same,” Trump also said, seemingly softening his stance on the “wall” amid efforts to make a deal with Democrats.
Immigration experts, however, tell OutletName that Trump has embraced new ideas about what kinds of barriers will be effective on the border after viewing various prototypes and speaking directly with Border Patrol agents on the ground. They also make clear that Trump’s newfound focus on “steel slats” does not mean that a concrete wall is now completely obsolete.
There is “not a one-size-fits-all” approach to a border barrier, former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director Thomas Homan told TheDC in a phone interview.
“There are different types depending on the terrain,” Homan explained, adding that steel slats are one of many options because “guys on the ground like the option of seeing through the other side.”
One person familiar with the administration’s border policy similarly made clear that proposed barriers are “not uniform” across the border. and are dependent on what Border Patrol agents say they require in their respective zones.
For example, areas near the Rio Grande river that are prone to flooding may require a concrete wall similar to Trump’s original campaign proposal, while drier areas like Calexico, California would be better served by a fence. The height of physical barriers would also vary depending on how highly trafficked border sections are.
Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan noted in an interview on OutletName’s “This Week” that the $5 billion the president is requesting in the shutdown battle would pay for more than just “a dumb barrier.”
“It’s about 215 miles of wall system,” McAleenan said, adding that the money would also pay for technology such as censors, lighting and cameras.
Democrats have seized on Trump’s tweet about steel slats to accuse him of breaking his campaign promises about the wall. House Minority Leader and soon-to-be Speaker Nancy Pelosi joked last week that Trump’s wall has turned into a “beaded curtain.”
While the president scoffed at the idea of his wall being conflated with a fence during the 2016 presidential campaign, administration officials and immigration experts now say that the wall is a euphemism for any type of border barrier.
“The wall is a barrier. The president’s words are being taken out of context,” Homan asserted. “Democrats don’t have a good argument against a border wall, so they pick on the president’s terminology … Democrats are refusing to fund a barrier because they don’t want Trump to win.”
“There may be a wall at some places, there may be steel slats, there may be technological enhancements,” White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said in a recent “OutletName Sunday” interview. “But always saying ‘wall’ or ‘no wall’ is being very disingenuous.”
Former Chief of Staff John Kelly knocked Trump’s wall in an exit interview with The OutletName, stating, “To be honest, it’s not a wall.”
Kelly also admitted, however, that the shift away from a concrete wall is primarily due to the administration asking “people what they needed and where they needed it” rather than the president shamelessly giving up on a campaign promise.
“To be honest, it’s not a wall,” Kelly said. “The president still says ‘wall’ — oftentimes frankly he’ll say ‘barrier’ or ‘fencing.’ Now, he’s tended toward steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.”","border patrol agents know exactly what they want in a border wall, and every mile varies. immigration experts tell outletname that president donald trump ’ s vision for a border barrier is informed directly by the requests of border patrol agents. trump tweeted one day before the partial government shutdown that he was looking into building a “ steel slat barrier ” that is “ totally effective. ” the tweet sparked endless media stories and mockery about how trump was backing down on his campaign promise of a concrete border wall. a design of our steel slat barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful! “ whatever you want to call it, it ’ s all the same, ” trump also said, seemingly softening his stance on the “ wall ” amid efforts to make a deal with democrats. immigration experts, however, tell outletname that trump has embraced new ideas about what kinds of barriers will be effective on the border after viewing various prototypes and speaking directly with border patrol agents on the ground. they also make clear that trump ’ s newfound focus on “ steel slats ” does not mean that a concrete wall is now completely obsolete. there is “ not a one - size - fits - all ” approach to a border barrier, former acting immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) director thomas homan told thedc in a phone interview. “ there are different types depending on the terrain, ” homan explained, adding that steel slats are one of many options because “ guys on the ground like the option of seeing through the other side. ” one person familiar with the administration ’ s border policy similarly made clear that proposed barriers are “ not uniform ” across the border. and are dependent on what border patrol agents say they require in their respective zones. for example, areas near the rio grande river that are prone to flooding may require a concrete wall similar to trump ’ s original campaign proposal, while drier areas like calexico, california would be better served by a fence. the height of physical barriers would also vary depending on how highly trafficked border sections are. customs and border protection commissioner kevin mcaleenan noted in an interview on outletname ’ s “ this week ” that the $ 5 billion the president is requesting in the shutdown battle would pay for more than just “ a dumb barrier. ” “ it ’ s about 215 miles of wall system, ” mcaleenan said, adding that the money would also pay for technology such as censors, lighting and cameras. democrats have seized on trump ’ s twee",0.999161005020141,0.499160962586757,0,412,1.7,5.1,5.1,0.49,1.7,3.4,11.65,1.94,2.18,1.46,1.46,1.21,4.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.68,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.97,0.0,0.0,2.43,0.73,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,11.17,0.49,8.98,1.21,0.0,0.24,2.67,2.91,3.88,0.97,5.097087378640777,8.980582524271846,0.7281553398058253
Daily Caller,"Former Vice President Al Gore said the recent Central American migrant caravans seeking asylum in the U.S. were fleeing the ravages of global warming.
Gore said the so-called “dry corridor,” which includes El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, “is the most vulnerable region in the world to global warming.”
“And they’ve gone without a harvest this year. Some have gone without a harvest for two years,” Gore told OutletName’s Christiane Amanpour in an interview Wednesday. “That is one of the principal causes for them making that long journey.”
Thousands of Central American migrants have joined caravans headed for the U.S.-Mexico border in order to seek asylum. Most experts see them as economic migrants, coming to the U.S. for work, not fleeing global warming. This isn’t the first time Gore linked global warming to recent migrant caravans. In December, Gore called the caravans a “recent, startling example” of global warming forcing people to flee their homes.
However, Gore is not the first to label the caravans “climate refugees.” It’s part of a broader media narrative to link the thousands joining U.S.-bound caravans to global warming.
For example, OutletName ran a story in October citing alleged experts who “say the big picture is that changing climate is forcing farmers off their land and it’s likely to get worse.”
That same month, The OutletName said the migrant caravan “foreshadows” what’s to come with global warming. And E&E News called the caravan a “preview of climate migrations,” that is, people driven from their homes due to man-made global warming.
Conflict scholars have largely debunked many of the claims linking global warming to armed conflict and migration.
To stem the tide of migrants, Gore said the U.S. needs to bring more economic and job security to Central America and work with the region’s governments “so they are not driven away from their homes.”","former vice president al gore said the recent central american migrant caravans seeking asylum in the u. s. were fleeing the ravages of global warming. gore said the so - called “ dry corridor, ” which includes el salvador, guatemala and honduras, “ is the most vulnerable region in the world to global warming. ” “ and they ’ ve gone without a harvest this year. some have gone without a harvest for two years, ” gore told outletname ’ s christiane amanpour in an interview wednesday. “ that is one of the principal causes for them making that long journey. ” thousands of central american migrants have joined caravans headed for the u. s. - mexico border in order to seek asylum. most experts see them as economic migrants, coming to the u. s. for work, not fleeing global warming. this isn ’ t the first time gore linked global warming to recent migrant caravans. in december, gore called the caravans a “ recent, startling example ” of global warming forcing people to flee their homes. however, gore is not the first to label the caravans “ climate refugees. ” it ’ s part of a broader media narrative to link the thousands joining u. s. - bound caravans to global warming. for example, outletname ran a story in october citing alleged experts who “ say the big picture is that changing climate is forcing farmers off their land and it ’ s likely to get worse. ” that same month, the outletname said the migrant caravan “ foreshadows ” what ’ s to come with global warming. and e & e news called the caravan a “ preview of climate migrations, ” that is, people driven from their homes due to man - made global warming. conflict scholars have largely debunked many of the claims linking global warming to armed conflict and migration. to stem the tide of migrants, gore said the u. s. needs to bring more economic and job security to central america and work with the region ’ s governments “ so they are not driven away from their homes. ”",4.46957710664e-05,0.499955296516418,0,324,1.85,5.56,3.09,0.62,1.23,1.85,5.56,0.0,1.23,0.31,0.93,0.0,3.09,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.93,1.54,0.62,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.23,16.36,3.09,9.88,0.62,0.0,3.09,4.01,4.63,2.78,0.31,0.9259259259259258,9.25925925925926,3.0864197530864197
HuffPost,"The current refugee and migrant crisis is one of the world’s greatest and most urgent problems. Why? Because not only is it terribly sad in terms of the profound suffering of millions of human beings –blameless men, women and children – but also, it is a huge waste of our current and future resources.
“An unprecedented 65.6 million people around the world have been forced from home. Among them are nearly 22.5 million refugees, over half of whom are under the age of 18.”[i] Millions of them are unable to work even though they are qualified and skilled. Most can contribute, today or in the future, but they will remain unable to for far too long, “nearly 50 million children are refugees or migrants, says UNICEF.”[ii] These children are growing up without stability, education and proper nutrition. In fact, an entire generation will grow up ill-equipped for their futures and with a host of issues from their traumatic childhoods.
This is of course, a very complex global crisis with many perspectives and interests involved. It is highly unlikely that there is one or few tidy solutions. The root problems that lend to the crisis are themselves vast. That said, as this crisis has grown over the last few years, our leaders have offered precious few ideas. We see more dodging and deflecting than we see proposals for lasting results. Others - industry experts, academics and journalists - have begun key discussions around the issue, hoping to better understand and address it. But the fact remains, years on, there are millions of people on the move and few reliable operations in play.
Perhaps, it is with the involvement of ordinary citizens that we can put pressure on the world’s leaders to do something substantial. Indeed, many have done just that. A few small business owners in Canada, Germany and other European countries have employed refugees and sponsored programs to educate children.[iii] In the US, industry giants like Starbucks and Chobani have pledged their support. Other organizations have begun working in camps around the world, teaching children, caring for the sick and helping entrepreneurs set up businesses. But these are examples of private engagement. Public and government resources have largely eluded these discussions and efforts. Without the support of policies, efforts will continue to remain limited.
There is much we can do, and much yet to learn. Imagine for a moment, that we had access to unlimited resources. Let’s consider some ideas.
The first step to finding lasting solutions is having the right conversations. These conversations must include the people they target. It’s crucial to visit camps and learn from those who live there. How many policy-makers are visiting camps and collecting data on the realities refugees face? Shouldn’t we know more about what works and what doesn’t? The same would apply for asylum seekers in government systems. How many of these systems are built to accept feedback and improve current solutions? For instance, what are the challenges to finding local employment and how can we overcome them? We reckon that there is a sizeable gap between requirements for the millions of migrants and what our countries offer them. Where there are now promising ideas and successful prototypes, we should champion them and help reproduce them widely. The best solutions, the ones most expected to last, would be born of conversations including all stakeholders, i.e. refugees/migrants, government and industry experts on the ground.
It is equally crucial to survey and manage the state of children’s health and education. There should be an international alliance committed to the wellbeing of refugee and migrant children. Children must have adequate nutrition, healthcare, education and safety. Consider that children most effectively join new societies with the promise to become contributing, self-sustaining citizens. Conversely, uneducated, unemployed youth lead to unstable societies.[iv] Investing in children’s development is key to future successes.
While we talk to the right people and build the right solutions, there is another thing we must simultaneously do: educate. We need to change the prevailing narrative of “us” vs. “them” in host countries. One way to change the conversation is to highlight the potential of migrants. People need to know that their governments have their best interests in mind. If governments do a better job of educating their populations on decisions regarding refugees and migrants, they’d be more likely to understand. Ultimately, many of those who come into host countries are future citizens. That’s how they should be seen, not as invaders. Many of these people add resources to otherwise aging or small populations. Their being driven out of their own homes, out of desperation, does not make them less able contributors.
The truth is that we shouldn’t - indeed needn’t - look at millions of people as burdens. There are some legitimate cultural concerns to overcome, and stifling peoples’ worries has proven as disruptive as riling them up on ignorance and fear. Honest discussions need to happen and societies must feel like they have a say in the way forward. Treating the millions on the run from war and poverty as a nuisance is senseless and ultimately, unproductive. Our leaders have the responsibility to correct this narrative.
What everyone needs to understand and accept is that the problem is real. This crisis will not end on its own. Even with political efforts that would discourage mass migrations in home countries, the likelihood is that in the immediate future, people will continue to move looking for better lives. It is therefore, in everyone’s best interest to invest our collective energies to solving the issue. Countries lobbing responsibilities (like Hungary and Poland) is not acceptable. And while governments argue amongst themselves they overlook opportunities while crises like human trafficking continue to thrive.

Daily Caller,"U.S. residents living near the southern border claim they are afraid to report immigration-related crimes to the police, detailing horrific stories of retaliation by Mexican cartels.
“I turned in 700 pounds [of marijuana] up here … I called it in [to Border Patrol]. They went and got it. That night, [the smugglers] came back. They … broke off all the floats off my troughs — chopped ’em up, drained all of it,” Billy Darnell, a cattle rancher in New Mexico, explained to the Washington Examiner.
Unlike other residents in the area, Darnell alerts the Border Patrol and local authorities whenever he sees an incident. However, the Hidalgo County cattle ranger says he has paid the price for talking.
Drug smugglers working for the cartels are constantly crossing the U.S-Mexico border, carrying marijuana and other illicit narcotics with them. Many times, smugglers will camp out and make use of property on the U.S. side of the border, clashing with American ranchers and residents.
After reaching out to residents living near the area, several told the Washington Examiner that reporting immigration-related crimes — such as burglary or finding drugs near their property — to the police can lead to retaliation. Fearing retribution, many of them forgo calling authorities altogether.
“I mix and mingle with these folks a lot,” said Joel Edwards, a Hidalgo County commissioner who said ranchers’ fears of retaliation by the cartels are legitimate. “That’s pretty much a real common feeling out there … I’ve heard it quite a bit in the last few weeks. They’re just scared.”
Another resident, Tricia Elbrock, believes cartel spotters camp out in the hills that overlook her home in Animas, New Mexico, and would know if she attempted to report suspicious activity. Elbrock has reported finding semiautomatic rifles, cellphones and satellite phones. However, she said she never approaches anything that is left on her property because people watching “could pick us off with a rifle.”
News of resident anxiety comes as lawmakers in Congress continue to debate border security and possible construction of a massive border wall.
After undergoing the longest shutdown in U.S. history, President Donald Trump relented and allowed the federal government to reopen in late January. However, Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have until Feb. 15 to reach an agreement or else face another shutdown. It’s not clear if Democrats will allow a comprehensive deal on border security to include funding for a border wall — something Trump has made clear is a deal-breaker. In the meantime, the president is wielding his executive authority to beef up security on the U.S.-Mexico border. The Pentagon announced Jan. 29 it was sending an additional 2,000 troops to the southwestern part of the border for a mission that will extend until Sept. 30. The Pentagon on Sunday announced another 3,750 U.S. troops to be deployed at the border.

NYTimes,"Aracely Martinez-Ramirez sat on the driveway by her rotting home, next to most of the family’s possessions, now slated for the trash: Her sisters’ flowered dresses, their baby dolls, a mud-caked Virgin Mary.
She had already battled a flood brought on by Hurricane Harvey and lost the house her family had bought — in full, in cash — just a few days before. Now, it seemed the president was looking to eliminate Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, the program for undocumented immigrants that allows her to work the three jobs that support the family.
“Why would he take it away?” said Ms. Martinez-Ramirez, 20, baking in the sour post-storm Texas heat. “What did we ever do wrong to him?”
Along the Gulf Coast, a panic has set in among immigrant families affected by the storm, after the White House said it would make an announcement on Tuesday about the future of DACA. Though the program, begun under President Barack Obama, has supporters in both parties, its critics call it both bad policy — suggesting that it encourages more illegal immigration — and unconstitutional.
The attorney general of Texas, Ken Paxton, has been among the initiative’s most determined opponents. He wrote a letter in June threatening to sue the federal government over DACA unless the administration phased it out. The notice was signed by nine of his counterparts in other states.
On Sunday, three officials told OutletName that President Trump was strongly considering ending the program, but only after he gives Congress six months to come up with a replacement. It was not clear what would happen if lawmakers failed to pass a bill by the deadline, and officials warned that Mr. Trump could still change his mind.
The five-year-old program shields from deportation many undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children, granting them two-year work permits that can be renewed. It applies to about 800,000 people, at least 124,000 of whom live in Texas; only California is home to more.
Among the DACA recipients in Texas is a Houston-area paramedic named Jesus Contreras who spent at least six days helping people during Harvey’s record floods. Another was Alonso Guillen, who died while working as a volunteer trying to rescue people in the storm.
As a candidate, President Trump vowed to “immediately terminate” DACA; more recently he has promised to treat recipients with “great heart” — a statement noted by flood-weary young immigrants here who said they feared losing their livelihoods after losing their homes.
“We love the Dreamers,” the president said as recently as Friday, employing a term many DACA recipients use to refer to themselves. It comes from an earlier effort to help them, a bill called the Dream Act that Congress never passed.
This weekend, in a heavily Latino section of northeast Houston, where the soggy innards of hundreds of mobile homes lined the streets, conversations were filled with uncertainty.
Undocumented immigrants, including DACA recipients, do not qualify for cash assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a representative from FEMA, though they can apply on behalf of children who are American citizens.
Bertha Perez, 27, said she applied for DACA protection about two months ago, and was waiting for an answer when the storm hit. Without it, she cannot work legally, and she has two children and two parents with health problems.
In her neighborhood near Greens Bayou, the floodwaters rose about 14 feet, inundating her parents’ home, with its purple walls and pink curtains.
“My dad, he’s been out of work for three months,” she said. “So we’ve got to figure out how they’re going to get their house together. And if I can’t help them out by getting a job with DACA, I’m pretty much in a bind.”
“You feel helpless,” she said, wiping away tears with muddied cleanup gloves. “Well, I feel helpless.”
Down the street, Avelino Justo, 24, said DACA had allowed him to find a $25-an-hour welding job and to buy the yellow house he shared with his wife, Ruby Solis, and their two daughters. Then the water rushed in, rendering it uninhabitable. His DACA work permit expires in May, and he has no flood insurance.
If Mr. Trump allows the program to continue, Mr. Justo said he will rebuild here. If the program is eliminated, he and his wife and children will probably have to move in with her mother. The family was waiting until Tuesday to make a decision.
“This was our dream, you know,” said Ms. Solis, 26, a receptionist at a law firm. “Both mine and his dream has always been: A small home, a cheap home that we could pay off quick, both of us put in a lot of overtime.”
“We never expected this to happen,” she said. “This storm just brought us right back down.”
A few blocks away, Ms. Martinez-Ramirez said she had moved into her mobile home only a few days before Harvey hit, after she and her mother had saved up and handed over $6,000.
“I brought Aracely when she was two years old,” said her mother, Maria Ramirez, 43, adding that they had to leave Mexico “so we could eat.”
After Ms. Martinez-Ramirez’s father was deported three years ago, she quit college and became the de facto second parent to her three sisters, ages 12, 9 and 7.
She works three jobs, and her schedule, she said, is filled. From 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., she sorts used clothing at a warehouse for $8.50 an hour. From 4 to 10 p.m., she sells snow cones from a snack stand, also for $8.50 an hour. And on Sunday, she babysits at church for $7.75 an hour. Because of DACA, which she received in February 2016, she said she can now drive, shop and walk her sisters to the bus stop without fearing arrest. “When I got DACA,” she said, “I felt free.”
When the storm came crashing through her neighborhood, Ms. Martinez-Ramirez said, she led her sisters through chest-high water, pulling the smallest ones in a round beach float. The family is now living with a friend from their Baptist church.
She returned to the trailer on Sunday to recover the family dishes. Her DACA permit expires in less than six months, and the family’s next move is anyone’s guess.

Breitbart,"Univision anchor Jorge Ramos insisted on Tuesday that a border wall will not prevent illegal immigrants and drugs from entering the country and said Americans must accept that the U.S.-Mexico border is “nothing more than an invention.”
“No matter how much you might want to seal the border between Mexico and the United States, its simply not possible. You might temporarily stop, delay, complicate or hinder the flow of immigrants and drugs from south to north, but nothing will ever stop it entirely,” he wrote in his Tuesday Univision column. “Though it may upset some politicians who’ve spent years making false promises, this is the reality of the situation.”
Ramos, who has said that the United States has a responsibility to “absorb” Central American migrants, said that “if there is anything immigrants are known for, it’s for their innovative thinking. When they come to a wall, they simply go around it. Or over it. Or they find a ladder to climb it. Or dig a tunnel underneath. Or they arrive by plane and overstay their visas. Walls by themselves are pretty useless.”
“If by some magic (or through behind-the-scenes negotiations), President Donald Trump could get the $5.7 billion he’s been asking for to build a wall, it would be of very little use,” Ramos continued. “That money would only get him about 234 miles worth of wall, according to the White House. What about the rest of the border?”
The amnesty activist also said that the “border has been a crooked proposition from the beginning, and it will continue to be twisted to meet political ends,” adding that many open-borders activists still insist that “people didn’t cross the border, the border crossed them.”
“At some point we will have to accept the fact that the border between Mexico and the United States is nothing more than an invention. It was demarcated in 1848, following a war that cost Mexico about half its territory (it’s no coincidence that cities like Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Francisco have Spanish names),” Ramos said. “Also, it’s been said a thousand times that many people didn’t cross the border, the border crossed them. And the cultural and commercial ties between the two sides remain in place to this day. Look at the fellowship exhibited by cities like El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico even if barbed wire and concrete barriers have been erected in some places along the divide.”
Ramos criticized Trump for comparing the U.S.-Mexico border wall to Israel’s because he said the United States and Mexico are not at war like the Israelis and the Palestinians. He also said “there isn’t a crisis at the border warranting a wall or the deployment of troops.”
“Yes, all countries have the right to mark and protect their borders. But the histories and traditions of countries like Mexico and the United States are so intertwined that there is no practical or legal way a wall would keep them apart,” Ramos added. “Some politicians, like Trump, may well try to come up with a way, but they are doomed to failure every time.”","univision anchor jorge ramos insisted on tuesday that a border wall will not prevent illegal immigrants and drugs from entering the country and said americans must accept that the u. s. - mexico border is “ nothing more than an invention. ” “ no matter how much you might want to seal the border between mexico and the united states, its simply not possible. you might temporarily stop, delay, complicate or hinder the flow of immigrants and drugs from south to north, but nothing will ever stop it entirely, ” he wrote in his tuesday univision column. “ though it may upset some politicians who ’ ve spent years making false promises, this is the reality of the situation. ” ramos, who has said that the united states has a responsibility to “ absorb ” central american migrants, said that “ if there is anything immigrants are known for, it ’ s for their innovative thinking. when they come to a wall, they simply go around it. or over it. or they find a ladder to climb it. or dig a tunnel underneath. or they arrive by plane and overstay their visas. walls by themselves are pretty useless. ” “ if by some magic ( or through behind - the - scenes negotiations ), president donald trump could get the $ 5. 7 billion he ’ s been asking for to build a wall, it would be of very little use, ” ramos continued. “ that money would only get him about 234 miles worth of wall, according to the white house. what about the rest of the border? ” the amnesty activist also said that the “ border has been a crooked proposition from the beginning, and it will continue to be twisted to meet political ends, ” adding that many open - borders activists still insist that “ people didn ’ t cross the border, the border crossed them. ” “ at some point we will have to accept the fact that the border between mexico and the united states is nothing more than an invention. it was demarcated in 1848, following a war that cost mexico about half its territory ( it ’ s no coincidence that cities like los angeles, san antonio and san francisco have spanish names ), ” ramos said. “ also, it ’ s been said a thousand times that many people didn ’ t cross the border, the border crossed them. and the cultural and commercial ties between the two sides remain in place to this day. look at the fellowship exhibited by cities like el paso, texas, and ciudad juarez, mexico even if barbed wire and concrete barriers have been erected in some places along",3.46533925039e-05,0.49996531009674,0,417,1.68,5.52,2.4,0.48,0.72,1.2,10.55,1.2,0.96,1.2,3.6,0.96,3.84,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.24,10.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.96,0.0,0.24,0.48,1.2,0.0,0.48,0.48,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,13.43,2.64,10.79,0.48,0.0,0.0,3.6,4.08,2.16,2.16,5.275779376498801,9.112709832134293,0.2398081534772182
FoxNews,"Nearly 200 people from Mexico and Central America were stuffed inside large trucks and caught trying to enter the United States illegally during three huge January smuggling busts that occurred in just nine days.
Officials in southern California said 77 people, including 5 children, were found near the Mexico border Monday packed inside a sweltering truck that had been painted to resemble a UPS truck.
The San Diego Union-Tribune reported a U.S. border patrol agent in Boulevard, Calif., noticed the truck was riding low and “could smell body odor mixed with a distinct type of pungent soap which is commonly used in Mexico.”
Inside the truck's cargo area, officials found people sweating and standing shoulder-to-shoulder.
A similar scene greeted authorities last week in Laredo, Texas, where border patrol agents found 76 immigrants, including 13 children, from Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala lying on the floor or crouching against the walls of a tractor-trailer rig.
A week earlier, also in Laredo, border agents stopped a tractor-trailer with 29 illegal immigrants from Mexico and Guatemala crossing into the U.S.
Laredo and southern California are home to two of the largest trade and transportation ports along the U.S.-Mexico border, and hundreds, if not thousands, of tractor-trailers move goods between the two countries.
Smugglers are taking advantage and carrying human cargo that can be easily transported across country lines without easy detection.
Jessica Vaughn, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, told OutletName on Thursday that these locations are funnels for an “enormous” volume of international trade, making them easy targets for smugglers.
“There is no way that all of them are screened [as closely as they should be],” she said, adding the financial incentive from smugglers and drivers is just too high to discard.
In the case out of Boulevard earlier this week, the driver was identified as Shawn Lee Seiler, a U.S. citizen who told authorities he was “an alien smuggler” who expected to get paid $100 per immigrant that he got across. According to court documents, Seiler was surprised to learn there were 77 people in the truck as he was only expecting 50.
“[This] is only a fraction of what the smugglers [who are putting them on the trucks] are getting,” Vaughn said. “It’s a couple thousand – I believe the going rate was around $3,000 a person.”
She continued: “The cartels that control the flow are making a huge amount of money...It’s a multi-million dollar business.”
Miguel Contreras, the special operations supervisor for U.S. Border Patrol in Laredo, told OutletName Thursday that the cost is more around $5,000 to $8,000 that people pay the criminal organizations from point of origin to point of destination.
All of the immigrants swept up during the three January busts were in good condition when they were found -- but this is not always the case.
Last July, 10 people died as they were being smuggled through Texas. Thirty-nine immigrants were found packed into a semitrailer in the parking lot of a San Antonio Walmart. Eight were already dead when officials opened the trailer's door and two more died at hospitals.
The truck's refrigeration system wasn't working and the day's temperature had climbed to 101 degrees.
The truck driver, identified as 60-year-old James Mathew Bradley Jr., of Clearwater, Fla., later pleaded guilty to conspiracy and to transporting immigrants resulting in death.
“These criminal organizations view these individuals as mere commodities without regard for their safety,” Gabriel Acosta, assistant chief patrol agent for the Laredo Border Patrol sector, said about the recent incidents. “The blatant disregard for human life will not be tolerated.”
It’s unclear how many tractor-trailers cross the border filled with human cargo and go undetected.
Contreras said they have seen an increase of tractor-trailer cases within the last few months. He said when spring hits, they expect to see an uptick.
In Laredo, border patrol are working to raise awareness among drivers that even though moving human cargo is “a quick buck” that there are consequences including jail time and losing their commercial driver’s license for life.
Vaughn believes law enforcement are seeing more immigrants crossing illegally into the U.S. in these conditions because it has become tougher to move in between the ports of entry. She said under the Trump administration, agents have shifted to patrolling the actual border, especially places where there is no actual border wall.
“We were missing a lot of people crossing the border,” she added.
The Trump administration’s hardline rhetoric and ongoing crackdown on illegal immigration does not appear to be deterring people from making the arduous trek across the southern border – mostly because the incentives awaiting them appear to outweigh the challenges or cost.
“They don’t know the details of the U.S. programs and the law; they just hear that there is going to be amnesty,” Vaughn said, adding that many believe they can work illegally once they make it to the U.S. “We have a moral duty to crackdown on this.”

NYTimes,"Vice President Mike Pence, an evangelical Christian, visits Israel this week, the culmination of his years of support for the country on religious grounds. But the Trump administration’s policies, while lauded by American evangelical groups, are opposed by Palestinian Christians and have been questioned by Pope Francis.
Those policies, in other words, align poorly with either the religious solidarity or foreign policy realism that supposedly animated them, but align perfectly with American identity politics.
Mr. Trump, with his penchant for indulging his nationalist impulses and disregarding foreign policy doctrine, is a perfect vessel for carrying that culture war abroad, with potentially far-reaching consequences.

How a Mideast Conflict Divided Americans
Americans, more polarized than at perhaps any other point in their modern history, tend to be less divided on foreign policy. But they split on Israel as if it were a domestic issue, suggesting that, whether they realize it or not, they experience it as such.
Asked whether they sympathize more with Israelis or Palestinians, Republicans answer the former nearly seven to one, according to a Pew survey. Democrats sympathize with the groups about equally. Within the parties, conservatives tilt more pro-Israeli.
That partisan gap is at it widest since Pew began asking the question in 1978. And it applies to nearly any policy question related to Israelis and Palestinians, suggesting that Americans derive their views by identifying with one side over the other.
Picking sides has long been taboo in American policy, with presidents asserting that the United States must remain neutral in order to negotiate peace. Mr. Trump, breaking with this practice, answers a major conservative demand. But this demand is relatively new. Its origins goes a long way to explaining Mr. Trump’s actions on Israel — and how they fit within his instincts for stoking American divisions.
When evangelical Christians organized as a political bloc in the 1980s, they made Israel a priority. Some interpreted the Bible as asserting Israel’s right to control the Palestinian territories. In the 1990s, as Democrats pushed for social changes, evangelicals sorted into the Republican Party.
“Israel isn’t an ‘issue’ for evangelicals in the same way that deregulation and a better tax policy are issues,” Robert Nicholson, who leads a Christian advocacy group, said in an email. “It is a matter of identity.”
While this bolstered Republicans’ pro-Israel attitudes, the parties did not polarize on the issue. Many evangelicals expressed their support as a matter of spiritual kinship rather than prevailing over Palestinians. After all, a number of Palestinians are Christian themselves. And Mr. Trump, though popular with evangelicals, is hardly one himself.
Research by Amnon Cavari, an Israeli political scientist, found that hard-line views on Israel had spread among conservatives only recently, and largely because of partisan polarization over domestic issues. Though conventional wisdom often suggests that evangelical and Jewish groups energized conservative views on Israel, in fact it was the other way around.
That began with the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which divided Americans over issues of terrorism, torture and inclusion, particularly of Muslims.

This became the basis of a culture war that, largely by chance, aligned almost perfectly with a real conflict just then unfolding between Israelis and Palestinians.
A period of terrible violence known as the second intifada — in which Palestinian militants staged shocking terrorist attacks and Israeli military actions killed scores of civilians — resonated with Americans. Israeli leaders, seeking Washington’s support, encouraged Americans to see their conflicts as one and the same. Being tough on terrorism became a core conservative value that was expressed, in part, as support for Israel — specifically, as support for harsh Israeli policies toward the conflict. This also aligned with increasingly negative attitudes toward Muslims. And an atmosphere of us-versus-them politics equated supporting Israelis with opposing Palestinians.
Though George W. Bush, then the president, encouraged both inclusion of Muslims and neutrality on Israel, polarization pulled some conservatives toward a zero-sum view of the conflict, in which maximally opposing Palestinians became a matter of identity. Trump Exports the Culture War
This opened a gap between the identity politics of the Republican base and the policies of its leaders — precisely the sort of gap that Mr. Trump would exploit in his presidential primary bid. As he rose by saying what others would not, he supercharged the Israeli-Palestinian conflict’s salience to identity issues among what would become his base.
Mr. Trump advocated severe restrictions on legal and illegal immigration, particularly from Muslim-majority countries whose citizens he said posed a threat. In doing so, the president aligned fear of demographic change with fear of terrorism.
There is no reason that those positions must necessarily line up with support for Israel, but Mr. Trump leveraged culture war passions to try to bring them together.
“Horrible killing of a 13 year old American girl at her home in Israel by a Palestinian terrorist.” Mr. Trump tweeted in 2016, adding, in a line that became his slogan for a travel ban on people from several majority-Muslim countries, “We must get tough.”
Mr. Trump also exploited polarization over Israel to rally supporters against Barack Obama, whom he repeatedly suggested was foreign-born, Muslim and suspiciously hostile toward Israel.
“Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves?” Mr. Trump asked on Twitter, also in 2016. “Think about it and let me know!” In office, this is one of a handful of issues, along with sharply curtailing legal immigration, on which Mr. Trump has taken concerted, unilateral action. He is now pressing to move the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem as early as next year.
These policies meet rising conservative demands that the United States abandon its traditional neutrality on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and instead side overtly with Israel.
While some say pro-Israel groups are responsible for this shift, Mr. Trump, who has had an icy relationship with those groups, in fact appears to be following the Republican base. In 2014, 51 percent of Republicans said the United States should lean toward Israel in peace talks. That number has since grown to 58 percent.
Mr. Trump represents the culmination of a trend that pro-Israel groups resisted for years: the loss of Jewish support. Even as Jews grew more liberal, many supported strongly pro-Israel policies. But as “pro-Israel” becomes synonymous with “conservative Republican,” Jews are drifting away. They oppose moving the embassy by almost 3-to-1.
Party politics started this process. In 2015, Republicans invited Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s right-wing prime minister, to address Congress in opposition to Mr. Obama’s policies on Iran. Though intended to turn American Jews and others against Mr. Obama, it had the opposite effect, polarizing them against Mr. Netanyahu.
Mr. Trump has taken it drastically further. He has indulged hard-core conservative instincts to a degree that, deliberately or not, attracted support from a white nationalist fringe that also tends to be hostile to Jews.
He is moving the idea of being “pro-Israel” even further right, separating it even from the Jewish support that is ostensibly critical to Israel’s long-term survival.
Revoking aid from refugees to punish Palestinian leaders, for instance, aligns with Mr. Trump’s nationalist tendencies to treat foreign populations as monolithic blocs. This, too, has its roots in American culture wars over immigration.
Like his immigration restrictions, Mr. Trump’s Israel policies can be unpopular outside his base. A December poll by the Brookings Institution found that only 31 percent of Americans support moving the embassy. But the base has shown itself often able to overwhelm party leadership. Mr. Pence’s religiosity may embody the old mode of American support for Israel, driven by groups with strong views on the conflict itself. That still exists, but is increasingly subsumed by a broader, blunter worldview that treats the Israeli-Palestinian issue as an extension of another conflict that can seem just as intractable: American partisanship.","vice president mike pence, an evangelical christian, visits israel this week, the culmination of his years of support for the country on religious grounds. but the trump administration ’ s policies, while lauded by american evangelical groups, are opposed by palestinian christians and have been questioned by pope francis. those policies, in other words, align poorly with either the religious solidarity or foreign policy realism that supposedly animated them, but align perfectly with american identity politics. mr. trump, with his penchant for indulging his nationalist impulses and disregarding foreign policy doctrine, is a perfect vessel for carrying that culture war abroad, with potentially far - reaching consequences. photo how a mideast conflict divided americans americans, more polarized than at perhaps any other point in their modern history, tend to be less divided on foreign policy. but they split on israel as if it were a domestic issue, suggesting that, whether they realize it or not, they experience it as such. asked whether they sympathize more with israelis or palestinians, republicans answer the former nearly seven to one, according to a pew survey. democrats sympathize with the groups about equally. within the parties, conservatives tilt more pro - israeli. that partisan gap is at it widest since pew began asking the question in 1978. and it applies to nearly any policy question related to israelis and palestinians, suggesting that americans derive their views by identifying with one side over the other. picking sides has long been taboo in american policy, with presidents asserting that the united states must remain neutral in order to negotiate peace. mr. trump, breaking with this practice, answers a major conservative demand. but this demand is relatively new. its origins goes a long way to explaining mr. trump ’ s actions on israel — and how they fit within his instincts for stoking american divisions. when evangelical christians organized as a political bloc in the 1980s, they made israel a priority. some interpreted the bible as asserting israel ’ s right to control the palestinian territories. in the 1990s, as democrats pushed for social changes, evangelicals sorted into the republican party. “ israel isn ’ t an ‘ issue ’ for evangelicals in the same way that deregulation and a better tax policy are issues, ” robert nicholson, who leads a christian advocacy group, said in an email. “ it is a matter of identity. ” while this bolstered republicans ’ pro - israel attitudes, the parties did not polarize on the issue. many evangelicals expressed their support as a matter of spiritual kinship",0.999976158142089,0.499976190883899,1,412,1.46,3.64,6.55,1.46,0.97,4.37,13.11,3.16,2.18,0.24,3.4,0.49,5.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.86,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.7,0.73,0.0,0.97,0.49,4.13,0.24,0.24,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,8.25,1.21,6.8,0.24,0.0,0.0,3.16,3.16,2.18,0.24,6.067961165048544,6.067961165048544,0.7281553398058253
HuffPost,"After a report of planned federal immigration raids targeting undocumented individuals in Northern California ― supposedly to send a message to the new “sanctuary” state ― California politicians came out with condemnation and vows to protect the immigrants in their communities.
In one of the strongest responses, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said Wednesday that she’d be willing to go to jail to defend her city’s sanctuary policies.
The San Francisco Chronicle reported Tuesday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were planning a major sweep in San Francisco and other cities around the Bay Area. The article, which cited an unnamed source familiar with the operation, said the raids could occur in the coming weeks and would aim to arrest more than 1,500 undocumented immigrants.
When asked to confirm the report, ICE told OutletName that the agency doesn’t “speculate about potential future enforcement actions.”
The goal of those allegedly upcoming raids, according to the Chronicle, would be in part to send a message that federal immigration enforcement will continue in California despite its statewide sanctuary status. The new statute, which went into effect this month, limits local law enforcement’s cooperation with federal immigration agents.
California’s Democratic politicians have forcefully condemned the reportedly planned raids.
“This Administration has continually put a target on the back of California,” Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) told OutletName in a statement Wednesday, adding, “These broad brush raids will instill fear in immigrants who are terrified they will receive a midnight knock on the door and be deported or separated from their families.”
“The Trump Administration’s deeply shameful plans to conduct immigration raids in California are an act of pure malice,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement.
“Immigrant families in California must not be targeted in raids solely because they are Californians,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in her statement. “The administration is carrying out its enforcement actions to make a political point and not based on the security of the country.”
“We will not turn our backs on the people of this City because of threats from the Trump Administration,” acting San Francisco Mayor London Breed said in a statement to OutletName. “San Francisco is and will always be a Sanctuary City and we will continue to defend and support our immigrant communities.”
Later on Wednesday, Feinstein and Harris released a joint letter to acting ICE Director Thomas Holman asking to be “immediately briefed on the troubling reports.”
“Diverting resources in an effort to punish California and score political points is an abhorrent abuse of power, not to mention a terrible misuse of scarce resources,” the senators wrote.Since President Donald Trump took office, ICE has sent repeated hard-line messages, declaring that undocumented immigrants should “look over [their] shoulder” and that politicians in sanctuary states should be prosecuted.
Trump has also attacked sanctuary laws, claiming they make cities more dangerous. Supporters argue that sanctuary laws make communities safer by encouraging undocumented residents to trust and cooperate with the police.
Earlier this month, Homan told OutletName that his agency would dramatically increase its enforcement efforts in California in response to the new sanctuary law.
“California better hold on tight,” he said.
Back in October, Homan responded to the governor’s signing of the sanctuary law by threatening “at-large arrests in local neighborhoods and at worksites, which will inevitably result in additional collateral arrests.”
The Chronicle’s source said that the upcoming sweeps would target undocumented individuals who have been identified for deportation, including those served with final deportation orders and those with criminal histories ― and that other undocumented immigrants could be swept up in “collateral arrests.”

Last week, federal immigration agents raided nearly a hundred 7-Eleven stores across the country, arresting 21 workers, in a crackdown that ICE said was meant to warn employers against hiring people without work authorizations.
“What it does when you have these raids ― where agents can go to any place in the country, with no regard to criminal offense ― no one will feel safe,” Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute’s offices at New York University School of Law, told OutletName last week.","after a report of planned federal immigration raids targeting undocumented individuals in northern california ― supposedly to send a message to the new “ sanctuary ” state ― california politicians came out with condemnation and vows to protect the immigrants in their communities. in one of the strongest responses, oakland mayor libby schaaf said wednesday that she ’ d be willing to go to jail to defend her city ’ s sanctuary policies. the san francisco chronicle reported tuesday that immigration and customs enforcement officials were planning a major sweep in san francisco and other cities around the bay area. the article, which cited an unnamed source familiar with the operation, said the raids could occur in the coming weeks and would aim to arrest more than 1, 500 undocumented immigrants. when asked to confirm the report, ice told outletname that the agency doesn ’ t “ speculate about potential future enforcement actions. ” the goal of those allegedly upcoming raids, according to the chronicle, would be in part to send a message that federal immigration enforcement will continue in california despite its statewide sanctuary status. the new statute, which went into effect this month, limits local law enforcement ’ s cooperation with federal immigration agents. california ’ s democratic politicians have forcefully condemned the reportedly planned raids. “ this administration has continually put a target on the back of california, ” sen. kamala harris ( d - calif. ) told outletname in a statement wednesday, adding, “ these broad brush raids will instill fear in immigrants who are terrified they will receive a midnight knock on the door and be deported or separated from their families. ” “ the trump administration ’ s deeply shameful plans to conduct immigration raids in california are an act of pure malice, ” house minority leader nancy pelosi ( d - calif. ) said in a statement. “ immigrant families in california must not be targeted in raids solely because they are californians, ” sen. dianne feinstein ( d - calif. ) said in her statement. “ the administration is carrying out its enforcement actions to make a political point and not based on the security of the country. ” “ we will not turn our backs on the people of this city because of threats from the trump administration, ” acting san francisco mayor london breed said in a statement to outletname. “ san francisco is and will always be a sanctuary city and we will continue to defend and support our immigrant communities. ” later on wednesday, feinstein and harris released a joint letter to acting ice director thomas holman asking to be “ immediately briefed on the troubling reports",0.999969244003295,0.499969264401443,1,413,0.73,1.94,9.44,2.18,1.45,5.81,7.99,1.45,1.94,0.97,1.21,0.0,2.66,0.0,1.21,0.73,0.24,0.0,11.14,0.48,0.0,0.73,0.0,0.0,0.48,3.15,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.73,10.9,2.18,9.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.84,3.15,1.45,3.15,6.2953995157385,7.021791767554479,0.9685230024213075
FoxNews,"As Washington, D.C. debates whether or not a wall will stop the flow of illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States, one Arizona county sheriff says it led to a dramatic 91 percent reduction in crime.
“The fence worked here. It may not work in New Mexico, I can only talk about my area. But [politicians should] defer to the Border Patrol experts,” Yuma County Sheriff Leon Wilmot told OutletName. “They know the situation.”
In 2006, President George W. Bush passed the Secure Fence Act which had a tremendous impact in Yuma County. In 2015, OutletName reported a 96 percent reduction in apprehensions due to a 20-foot tall steel fence and manpower being tripled. Wilmot was a deputy during that time but saw the impact firsthand.
“It was a 91 percent drop,” Wilmot said. “It obviously helped us curb some of the criminal activity that we unfortunately had to deal with.”
The 91 percent reduction in crime Wilmot cites is a Sheriffs office number. According to Wilmot, service calls and arrests dropped dramatically between 2005-2009 leading to the conclusion that added fencing along with more manpower had a major impact on local crime. According to Wilmot this number also includes immigration-related arrests and apprehensions that Sheriff's deputies would have made and crimes committed against smuggling victims.
“When they were no longer able to take advantage of our border as a smuggler’s paradise, the crimes against those being smuggled virtually stopped,” Wilmot said.
Data from the U.S. Border Patrol also shows that since 2005, total illegal alien apprehensions dropped from 138,438 to 12,847 in 2017. It was as low 5,833 in 2011.
The “wall” the president wants has been a bone of contention between Democrats and Republicans. Wilmot, however, believes it is an important part of fixing the border.
“When it comes to border security you need all of it,” said Wilmot. “You can fence up a house but you need everything else to make it secure.”
“For [Yuma County] we needed it to stop the criminal element.”
In a recent interview with the Epoch Times, Wilmot talked about utilizing fencing to cut border crime in the area by 91 percent and the Obama administration’s impact on the area.
During his interview with OutletNameNews.com, he was more focused on other deterrents to stopping immigrants from taking the dangerous trek to through his area and other border areas.
“Why is the U.S. attorney's office not prosecuting these parents?” Wilmot said. “These children are being pushed under razor wire, canal water. That’s not being a parent. We found a five or six-year-old the other day with pneumonia because his parents didn’t properly take care of him.”
According to Wilmot, the Border Patrol in his area currently has 160 immigrant children in their custody.
ICE: NO CONTACT WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ACCUSED OF KILLING CALIFORNIA COP BEFORE MURDER
“We don’t have enough time determine if the [adults] they are with have custody,” Wilmot said.
Law enforcement leaders like Wilmot are becoming more vocal when it comes to immigration and letting everyone know what works and what is needed.
Wilmot believes Washington isn’t trying to be part of the solution.
“They need to get their heads out of the sand. They need to get to work,” Wilmot told OutletNameNews.com. “Law enforcement is working, they’re not even getting paid. They can’t agree on a budget?”
CALIFORNIA POLICE OFFICER'S KILLING BY ACCUSED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT 'A SENSELESS TRAGEDY', CHIEF SAYS
Wilmot’s county borders 126 miles with Mexico and while he does believe President Donald Trump is helping by forcing Congress to deal with illegal immigration and its impact, he still feels like there is more to be done by both parties and believes the issue shouldn’t be political.
“Our border patrol partners are overwhelmed,” said Wilmot. “I don’t care who was elected.”
In October the Western States Sheriffs Association released a statement on the immigration crisis saying that it was at a “critical juncture.”
“The vast majority of our citizens are truly frustrated, and disappointed with our national leadership. It is past time that our elected national leaders put aside their partisan positions and focus on what is best for our nation, while maintaining the rights of all people in our country,” the statement read.","as washington, d. c. debates whether or not a wall will stop the flow of illegal immigration from mexico to the united states, one arizona county sheriff says it led to a dramatic 91 percent reduction in crime. “ the fence worked here. it may not work in new mexico, i can only talk about my area. but [ politicians should ] defer to the border patrol experts, ” yuma county sheriff leon wilmot told outletname. “ they know the situation. ” in 2006, president george w. bush passed the secure fence act which had a tremendous impact in yuma county. in 2015, outletname reported a 96 percent reduction in apprehensions due to a 20 - foot tall steel fence and manpower being tripled. wilmot was a deputy during that time but saw the impact firsthand. “ it was a 91 percent drop, ” wilmot said. “ it obviously helped us curb some of the criminal activity that we unfortunately had to deal with. ” the 91 percent reduction in crime wilmot cites is a sheriffs office number. according to wilmot, service calls and arrests dropped dramatically between 2005 - 2009 leading to the conclusion that added fencing along with more manpower had a major impact on local crime. according to wilmot this number also includes immigration - related arrests and apprehensions that sheriff's deputies would have made and crimes committed against smuggling victims. “ when they were no longer able to take advantage of our border as a smuggler ’ s paradise, the crimes against those being smuggled virtually stopped, ” wilmot said. data from the u. s. border patrol also shows that since 2005, total illegal alien apprehensions dropped from 138, 438 to 12, 847 in 2017. it was as low 5, 833 in 2011. the “ wall ” the president wants has been a bone of contention between democrats and republicans. wilmot, however, believes it is an important part of fixing the border. “ when it comes to border security you need all of it, ” said wilmot. “ you can fence up a house but you need everything else to make it secure. ” “ for [ yuma county ] we needed it to stop the criminal element. ” in a recent interview with the epoch times, wilmot talked about utilizing fencing to cut border crime in the area by 91 percent and the obama administration ’ s impact on the area. during his interview with outletnamenews. com, he was more focused on other deterrents to stopping immigrants from taking the dangerous trek to through",1.91656581591e-05,0.499980807304382,0,402,4.98,4.73,5.72,1.24,1.74,3.48,10.45,1.0,2.24,1.99,1.24,0.5,3.48,0.0,0.75,0.75,0.0,0.0,8.21,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,0.25,2.24,0.0,0.25,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,1.74,9.95,2.24,7.46,0.25,0.0,0.0,3.48,6.47,2.49,0.75,5.707196029776675,7.6923076923076925,1.240694789081886
NYTimes,"The two Marines pulled over on an exit ramp along a desolate desert highway in Southern California this month, and opened a back door of their black BMW just long enough for three people to rush from the thorny scrub into the back seat. They were about a mile from the southern border, where thousands of troops have deployed this year to try to stem the flow of migrants — but the authorities say the Marines in the BMW had the opposite aim. According to a federal criminal complaint, they planned to make some easy money by taking their passengers, migrants from Mexico, to the next stop on their smuggling route north. Instead, they were pulled over minutes later and arrested by Border Patrol agents. That stop on July 3 led this week to the arrest of 16 other Marines suspected of human smuggling and drug violations, pointing to a much broader operation that reached deep into the enlisted ranks. Those Marines — from Camp Pendleton, near Oceanside, Calif. — have not yet been charged. But their arrests are a glaring indication that stepped-up enforcement at the border by both troops and Border Patrol agents has done little to stop migrants, and has instead had an unintended effect: pushing up smuggling fees and attracting atypical players to the trade. Surging prices for sneaking past heavily patrolled areas north of the border have brought bigger payoffs that can be difficult to resist, even for the military. The two Marines caught by the Border Patrol, Lance Cpl. Byron Darnell Law II and Lance Cpl. David Javier Salazar-Quintero, were assigned to the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment at Camp Pendleton. They told the authorities they had been recruited by another man, unnamed in the complaint, who would often meet with them in a parking lot next to a Whole Foods supermarket. Smugglers of migrants are often not cartel kingpins but small players directing a web of independent contractors: foot guides, drivers and operators of stash houses where migrants are held until friends or family members pay an installment for the next leg of their trip. The smugglers often recruit through Facebook, Craigslist and WhatsApp groups, or through word-of-mouth. Alex Mensing, a project coordinator for Pueblo Sin Fronteras, a group that helps organize and support migrant caravans, said that as pressure on border crossers builds, and as prices rise, new groups of Americans will inevitably try to capitalize on the demand. “At the end of the day, everybody has their price,” he said. “And when you put people in charge of a system that enough people are trying to game, it’s just bound to happen.” The three Mexicans in the BMW told the authorities that they had paid $8,000 to be smuggled north. For the hourlong drive to San Diego, the Marines would get a small cut. Lance Corporal Salazar-Quintero called Lance Corporal Law late on July 2, asking if he wanted to make $1,000 to “pick up an illegal alien,” the complaint said. Lance corporals earn about $2,000 a month in base pay. The men drove in Lance Corporal Law’s car about an hour east of San Diego on the interstate, through the craggy desert mountains to a faded resort town called Jacumba Hot Springs. Migrants who try to cross through the mountains typically begin their journeys in cities like Tijuana, Mexico, and are driven by smugglers into remote parts of the California high desert where they then set out on foot. They can sometimes hike for hours through terrain studded with boulders and thick brush, with no access to water. For years the remote valley around Jacumba Hot Springs has drawn a steady stream of smugglers of both drugs and humans. In 2018, authorities discovered a 627-foot tunnel under the border there, complete with a rail line and solar-powered ventilation. Lance Corporal Law drove while Lance Corporal Salazar-Quintero, who speaks Spanish, got directions through his phone from a smuggler with a Mexican phone number. They were told to pull over at the exit to Jacumba Hot Springs, and a single Spanish-speaking man quickly got in. The Marines drove to a McDonald’s parking lot in Del Mar and delivered the man to someone the complaint described as their recruiter, and then went home. The next morning they got another call from the recruiter, according to the complaint, and drove toward Jacumba Hot Springs again. Smugglers will pay anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars to drivers who pick up migrants near the border and drive them through the 100-mile-zone north of the frontier that is closely monitored by Border Patrol agents. For migrants, a journey that a decade ago cost between $1,000 and $3,000 costs upward of $10,000 today, in part to pay American drivers for risking federal prison sentences. Last year, four soldiers from Fort Hood, in Killeen, Tex., were convicted of hiding unauthorized migrants under military gear, and two soldiers from Fort Bliss, near El Paso, pleaded guilty to smuggling a pair of migrants in the back of their vehicle. When the two Marines drove east to Jacumba Hot Springs on July 3, the smuggler told them to go past the exit and make a U-turn in an emergency pull-off. They stopped at the exit ramp on the westbound side. Within seconds, according to the complaint, the three Mexicans waiting in the brush bounded into the car, but they caught the attention of Border Patrol agents, who pulled the car over a few miles away. The leaders at Camp Pendleton sent a strong message this week as the investigation widened, ordering the 16 Marines to the front of an early morning battalion formation on Thursday, and arresting them in front of 800 of their peers. The Marine Corps has not released the names of the 16 Marines arrested this week. The commanding officer of the battalion, the Corps said in a statement, “would act within his authority to hold the Marines accountable at the appropriate level, should they be charged.”","the two marines pulled over on an exit ramp along a desolate desert highway in southern california this month, and opened a back door of their black bmw just long enough for three people to rush from the thorny scrub into the back seat. they were about a mile from the southern border, where thousands of troops have deployed this year to try to stem the flow of migrants — but the authorities say the marines in the bmw had the opposite aim. according to a federal criminal complaint, they planned to make some easy money by taking their passengers, migrants from mexico, to the next stop on their smuggling route north. instead, they were pulled over minutes later and arrested by border patrol agents. that stop on july 3 led this week to the arrest of 16 other marines suspected of human smuggling and drug violations, pointing to a much broader operation that reached deep into the enlisted ranks. those marines — from camp pendleton, near oceanside, calif. — have not yet been charged. but their arrests are a glaring indication that stepped - up enforcement at the border by both troops and border patrol agents has done little to stop migrants, and has instead had an unintended effect : pushing up smuggling fees and attracting atypical players to the trade. surging prices for sneaking past heavily patrolled areas north of the border have brought bigger payoffs that can be difficult to resist, even for the military. the two marines caught by the border patrol, lance cpl. byron darnell law ii and lance cpl. david javier salazar - quintero, were assigned to the 1st battalion, 5th marine regiment at camp pendleton. they told the authorities they had been recruited by another man, unnamed in the complaint, who would often meet with them in a parking lot next to a whole foods supermarket. smugglers of migrants are often not cartel kingpins but small players directing a web of independent contractors : foot guides, drivers and operators of stash houses where migrants are held until friends or family members pay an installment for the next leg of their trip. the smugglers often recruit through facebook, craigslist and whatsapp groups, or through word - of - mouth. alex mensing, a project coordinator for pueblo sin fronteras, a group that helps organize and support migrant caravans, said that as pressure on border crossers builds, and as prices rise, new groups of americans will inevitably try to capitalize on the demand. “ at the end of the day, everybody has their price, ” he said. “ and when you put people in",0.999974608421325,0.499974608514094,1,426,2.35,6.1,5.63,1.88,0.94,2.82,7.04,0.94,0.7,1.17,1.41,0.0,3.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.68,0.23,0.23,0.0,0.7,0.0,0.23,1.88,1.88,0.23,1.17,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.23,0.0,0.7,0.0,13.38,3.76,8.92,0.47,0.0,0.23,5.16,5.63,1.88,0.47,4.460093896713615,10.093896713615024,0.4694835680751174
HuffPost,"""Certain parts of the world are made up of “shithole countries” whose citizens are undeserving of a chance for a better life in America, President Donald Trump claimed Thursday during an Oval Office meeting with lawmakers. Although many saw those crass remarks as a clear window into the president’s bigoted worldview, Trump’s supporters rushed to his defense in an effort to distract from the simple reality at the heart of this latest White House scandal: The president of the United States is a racist man pursuing a racist immigration agenda.
Let’s take a look at these arguments and why they’re so bad.
Trump was talking like a liquored-up barfly, so it’s fine.
“This is how the forgotten men and women in America talk at the bar,” said OutletName commentator and perpetual disappointment to his parents Jesse Watters. “This is how Trump relates to people. If you’re at a bar, and you’re from Wisconsin, and you’re thinking, ‘They’re bringing in a bunch of Haiti people, or El Salvadorians, or people from Niger.’ This is how some people talk.”
Other supporters likened Trump’s comments to locker room banter ― we’ve heard that before ― or even “kitchen table” talk, suggesting the president was just mimicking conversations that happen in some corners of the U.S. every day.
That’s no doubt true. But historically, American presidents have been held to a higher standard than racist uncles or drunks at the bar. Typically they’ve been better qualified to lead a nation, too. And while it would be foolish to pretend some of these sorts of people aren’t among Trump’s base, that doesn’t mean everyone else has to shut up and go along when the president tries to write national policy with ink tainted by their ideology.
Trump was right: Some of these countries are “shitholes”!
A number of conservative pundits leapt to this explanation, arguing that if nations like Haiti and El Salvador were doing well, people wouldn’t be coming to the U.S. in the first place.
Option A: El Salvador isn't a ""shithole,"" so they don't need 17 years of Temporary Protected Status, and migrants from there should be sent home immediately. Option B: El Salvador is, in fact, a ""shithole."" ://t.co/sea1sKoY8K — Tucker Carlson () January 11, 2018
We’ll get this out of the way quickly: Calling a country or continent a “shithole” is deeply offensive, entirely unproductive and seemingly counter to core American values grounded in compassion and inclusivity.
Beyond all that, the dismissive jab also conveniently skirts any deeper consideration of the many uncomfortable reasons why those nations are in bad shape today. It has everything to do with a centuries-long history of racism, exploitation and aggressive Western incursion, noted journalist Jonathan Katz, who recently wrote a book about Haiti.
“Racists have needed Haiti to be poor since it was founded,” he wrote. “They pushed for its poverty. They have celebrated its poverty. They have tried to profit from its poverty. They wanted it to be a shithole. And they still do.”
Check out his whole thread below.
Lot of folks, from the alt-right to , think they’re making a great argument in the president’s defense tonight by noting that Haiti and El Salvador are, in fact, poor.
But they’re just revealing their own racism. Here’s why: — Jonathan M. Katz () January 12, 2018
Because what they are showing is that they ASSUME that Haiti is just naturally poor, that it’s an inherent state borne of the corruption of the people there, in all senses of the word.
And let’s just say out loud why that is: It’s because Haitians are black. — Jonathan M. Katz () January 12, 2018
Trump was calling out nationality, not race.
When Trump said he wanted fewer immigrants coming to the U.S. from Haiti, El Salvador or the entire continent of Africa, and more from places like Norway, he was saying exactly that and nothing more, his supporters argue. MAGA types were out in force on social media Friday noting that words like “Haitian” or “Salvadoran” describe a nationality, not a race, and therefore any derogatory statements Trump had made toward them couldn’t be inherently racist.
Why might Trump, a man with a long history of racially insensitive and racist comments, be so quick to write off millions of black and brown people while showing preference for white ones? Who’s to say?
Trump’s words sound icky, but his point is actually good!
It can be hard to extract concrete policy proposals out of the president’s off-the-cuff remarks, so we’ll leave that task to his loyal translators. Trump’s message was obvious to White House spokesman Raj Shah: Trump supports “merit-based immigration,” as opposed to a system that weighs family connections or country of origin.
“President Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation,” Shah said in a statement.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) felt similarly, wrapping an endorsement of merit-based immigration into a mealy-mouthed rebuke of the president.
Although there is evidence that a family-based system of immigration provides a number of benefits to the U.S., that’s really beside the point: Trump didn’t argue for a policy that gives preference to doctors or other high-skilled workers. He said give me more Norwegians and fewer people of color.
It was a surprisingly transparent presentation of Trump’s broader immigration agenda, which would disproportionately affect non-white people in a number of other ways, from the large proportion of Africans who benefit from the diversity visa lottery to Americans and legal permanent residents, often Latino and Asian, who want to sponsor family members to come to the U.S.
Other presidents were foul-mouthed racists, so what’s the big deal?
In some circles, Trump’s apparent utterance of the word “shit” was the actual issue here. Setting the bar for our current president at Richard Nixon, a notorious anti-Semite and racist, or other similarly controversial presidents from a half-century ago seems like a bad idea.
If the President saying ""shithole countries"" bothers you, don't ever listen to the JFK, LBJ, or Nixon tapes of your ears will explode. #PearlClutching — Derek Hunter () January 11, 2018
Trump didn’t actually say it.
The president attempted to do a little damage control on Friday, saying that he’d used “tough” language during the Oval Office meeting, though perhaps not the word “shithole.”
The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA! — Donald J. Trump () January 12, 2018
Trump later claimed he “never said anything derogatory about Haitians” and got some cover from Republican Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.) and David Perdue (Ga.), who released a joint statement saying, “We do not recall the President saying these comments specifically.”
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) had a clearer recollection:""",""" certain parts of the world are made up of “ shithole countries ” whose citizens are undeserving of a chance for a better life in america, president donald trump claimed thursday during an oval office meeting with lawmakers. although many saw those crass remarks as a clear window into the president ’ s bigoted worldview, trump ’ s supporters rushed to his defense in an effort to distract from the simple reality at the heart of this latest white house scandal : the president of the united states is a racist man pursuing a racist immigration agenda. let ’ s take a look at these arguments and why they ’ re so bad. trump was talking like a liquored - up barfly, so it ’ s fine. “ this is how the forgotten men and women in america talk at the bar, ” said outletname commentator and perpetual disappointment to his parents jesse watters. “ this is how trump relates to people. if you ’ re at a bar, and you ’ re from wisconsin, and you ’ re thinking, ‘ they ’ re bringing in a bunch of haiti people, or el salvadorians, or people from niger. ’ this is how some people talk. ” other supporters likened trump ’ s comments to locker room banter ― we ’ ve heard that before ― or even “ kitchen table ” talk, suggesting the president was just mimicking conversations that happen in some corners of the u. s. every day. that ’ s no doubt true. but historically, american presidents have been held to a higher standard than racist uncles or drunks at the bar. typically they ’ ve been better qualified to lead a nation, too. and while it would be foolish to pretend some of these sorts of people aren ’ t among trump ’ s base, that doesn ’ t mean everyone else has to shut up and go along when the president tries to write national policy with ink tainted by their ideology. trump was right : some of these countries are “ shitholes ”! a number of conservative pundits leapt to this explanation, arguing that if nations like haiti and el salvador were doing well, people wouldn ’ t be coming to the u. s. in the first place. option a : el salvador isn't a "" shithole, "" so they don't need 17 years of temporary protected status, and migrants from there should be sent home immediately. option b : el salvador is, in fact, a "" shithole.

NYTimes,"“In how many other countries can you call the top elected official in the country a liar and get away with it?” said Mr. Le, 50. “Although our democratic process looks dirty to some people, in the end it all comes out clean. We continue to be the longest-standing constitutional nation in the entire history of Earth, and it is because our forefathers designed that constitution so uniquely in balancing out the powers.”
The president’s cabinet meeting bothered Yohannes Tesfagibir, too.
Mr. Tesfagibir, 36, came to the United States eight years ago from his native country of Eritrea, an East African nation. Isaias Afwerki, Eritrea’s only president since it won independence in the 1990s, rules a country known as the North Korea of Africa, where national elections have never been held and young people are forced to work for extended periods in a national service program. Last year, a United Nations commission of inquiry said the national service program amounted to a form of slavery and accused the leaders of Eritrea of other crimes against humanity in a report denounced by government officials.
The scene in Washington reminded him of a scene in Eritrea. “It’s reminiscent of the one-man show, everyone working for the president instead of working for the country,” Mr. Tesfagibir said of the Trump cabinet session. “It was very suspicious.”
Still, although Mr. Tesfagibir said he was worried about the direction of the country and called Mr. Trump “a bully,” he said he never loses perspective.
“The reason I’m talking to you now is because I’m free,” he said.
Immigrants and refugees differed on drawing parallels between the political turmoil in America with the turmoil of their home countries.
Mr. Alatassi, the Syrian whose immigration status was caught up in a temporary limbo after Mr. Trump’s travel ban, said elements of the Trump presidency remind him of a Middle Eastern authoritarian regime: paternal leaders whose families dominate the power structure; policies and rhetoric harking back to a glorified and oversimplified past.
“The whole talk from Trump about, ‘I’m going to solve their problems, somebody else is the cause of the problems, and if you’re not with me, then you’re not patriotic’ — that’s the Middle East,” Mr. Alatassi said.
But M. J. Khan, a Pakistani-American businessman, Republican and former councilman who became the first Muslim-American to win a seat on the city council in 2003, said there was no comparison politically or culturally between Trump-era America and the Middle East. Having the simple freedom to speak your mind and to pray, shop and live as you wish made any comparison moot.
“We used to get something called a ration card,” Mr. Khan said of growing up in Pakistan. “Food was rationed off, so every family would get a ration card based on how many people you have in the family, and you can only get that much food. There’s no freedom of any kind. You cannot go and talk against any person in authority at all. Over here, I can go to the city council next Tuesday and blast out the mayor.”
Mr. Khan, 67, the president of the Islamic Society of Greater Houston, said he is as outraged as anyone else on Capitol Hill over Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
“It makes me angry as an American,” Mr. Khan said. “The beauty of America was, and still is, fair and impartial elections. I’ve lived in a society where that was not the case. In spite of all the challenges we have, this is still by far the best system, the best society, the best country, you name it. Maybe because we have had it so good we are spoiled and we expect better.”
The political pulse of Houston’s global village is, if nothing else, intricately nuanced. With Russia dominating the headlines and drawing the ire of many Americans, the executive director of Houston’s Russian Cultural Center had a clear point to make: She was appalled at the unrestrained hostility toward Mr. Trump on display in popular culture and in the news media.
The director, Sophia Grinblat, who came to the United States from Soviet-era Ukraine in 1990, said two incidents — Kathy Griffin holding what looked like the decapitated head of Mr. Trump and the assassination of a Trump look-alike in a production of “Julius Caesar” in Central Park — opened the door to the real-life violence that unfolded last week at the Republican congressional baseball practice in Alexandria.
“I spent 27 years here and I never hear anything in the media so anti-presidential, never, ever in my life,” Ms. Grinblat said. “If this is O.K. to make a play in a New York park how they killed the president and everybody laughed and think this is funny, and if this is O.K. to publish information like that, some crazy people take it as a recipe to act.”
Ms. Grinblat, who serves as the editor in chief of a Russian-language newspaper called Our Texas, said the media coverage was unbalanced in both Russia and the United States, largely pro-Putin there, anti-Trump here. “The situation is going more and more similar to Russia,” she said.
Leopold Kazadi, 39, a community college student from the Democratic Republic of Congo, also spoke of the media portrayals of Mr. Trump. He said he watched late-night comics poke fun at the president with a kind of deep patriotism. He said he had friends in Congo who went to prison for demonstrating against President Joseph Kabila.
“Here I see a lot of comedians make a joke about the president,” said Mr. Kazadi, whose relatives still live in Congo. “People can speak out. In Congo, I can say it’s like ‘esclave.’ I say ‘esclave’ in French. People are like slaves.” He added, “My mom tells me all the time, ‘I’m so glad you’re over there.’”","“ in how many other countries can you call the top elected official in the country a liar and get away with it? ” said mr. le, 50. “ although our democratic process looks dirty to some people, in the end it all comes out clean. we continue to be the longest - standing constitutional nation in the entire history of earth, and it is because our forefathers designed that constitution so uniquely in balancing out the powers. ” the president ’ s cabinet meeting bothered yohannes tesfagibir, too. mr. tesfagibir, 36, came to the united states eight years ago from his native country of eritrea, an east african nation. isaias afwerki, eritrea ’ s only president since it won independence in the 1990s, rules a country known as the north korea of africa, where national elections have never been held and young people are forced to work for extended periods in a national service program. last year, a united nations commission of inquiry said the national service program amounted to a form of slavery and accused the leaders of eritrea of other crimes against humanity in a report denounced by government officials. the scene in washington reminded him of a scene in eritrea. “ it ’ s reminiscent of the one - man show, everyone working for the president instead of working for the country, ” mr. tesfagibir said of the trump cabinet session. “ it was very suspicious. ” still, although mr. tesfagibir said he was worried about the direction of the country and called mr. trump “ a bully, ” he said he never loses perspective. “ the reason i ’ m talking to you now is because i ’ m free, ” he said. immigrants and refugees differed on drawing parallels between the political turmoil in america with the turmoil of their home countries. mr. alatassi, the syrian whose immigration status was caught up in a temporary limbo after mr. trump ’ s travel ban, said elements of the trump presidency remind him of a middle eastern authoritarian regime : paternal leaders whose families dominate the power structure ; policies and rhetoric harking back to a glorified and oversimplified past. “ the whole talk from trump about, ‘ i ’ m going to solve their problems, somebody else is the cause of the problems, and if you ’ re not with me, then you ’ re not patriotic ’ — that ’ s the middle east, ” mr. alatassi said. but m. j. khan, a pakistani - american businessman, republican and former councilman",0.999983191490173,0.499983177094691,1,395,1.01,2.53,8.35,1.01,1.77,5.82,8.86,1.77,1.77,0.25,0.51,0.0,3.8,0.0,0.51,0.25,0.0,0.0,16.46,0.51,0.0,0.0,4.3,0.0,0.25,3.54,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.25,10.13,1.01,8.86,0.51,0.0,0.0,4.56,5.82,2.28,0.51,5.5696202531645564,6.582278481012659,0.7594936708860759
Daily Caller,"President Trump continued to promote his plan to end birthright citizenship during his rally in Estero, Florida on Wednesday night.
“The Democrats want to continue giving automatic birthright citizenship to every child born to an illegal alien. Even if they’ve been on our soil for a matter of seconds. Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant children are made automatic citizens every year because of this crazy policy and they are instantly eligible for every privilege and benefit of American citizenship at a cost of billions of dollars a year,” Trump stated.
“That’s what it costs — billions. Back before the [Democratic] Party went crazy they also opposed this practice. Harry Reid said ‘no sane country,’ ‘no sane country’ would grant automatic citizenship to children of illegal immigrants — that’s what he said before he went crazy,” he continued. The president recently raised the issue during an interview with Axios’ Jonathan Swan on Monday night. During the interview, Trump explained that he doesn’t believe there is a need for a constitutional amendment to overturn birthright citizenship. Despite the president’s claim, many have said that an executive order would not be sufficient to overturn it.
“Under this policy anyone who breaks into the country and has a child the very next moment that child would be made a citizen for life. Great. This policy has even created an entire industry of birth tourism,” Trump added. “Big business, where pregnant mothers travel to America to make their children instant American citizens. Congress has never passed a law requiring birthright citizenship for illegal aliens and the Constitution does not, and I say that to the media, does not require it — read it — because illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.”
The president was in Florida on behalf of Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis and Senate candidate Rick Scott. Both are in tight races going into the November 6th election.","president trump continued to promote his plan to end birthright citizenship during his rally in estero, florida on wednesday night. “ the democrats want to continue giving automatic birthright citizenship to every child born to an illegal alien. even if they ’ ve been on our soil for a matter of seconds. hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant children are made automatic citizens every year because of this crazy policy and they are instantly eligible for every privilege and benefit of american citizenship at a cost of billions of dollars a year, ” trump stated. “ that ’ s what it costs — billions. back before the [ democratic ] party went crazy they also opposed this practice. harry reid said ‘ no sane country, ’ ‘ no sane country ’ would grant automatic citizenship to children of illegal immigrants — that ’ s what he said before he went crazy, ” he continued. the president recently raised the issue during an interview with axios ’ jonathan swan on monday night. during the interview, trump explained that he doesn ’ t believe there is a need for a constitutional amendment to overturn birthright citizenship. despite the president ’ s claim, many have said that an executive order would not be sufficient to overturn it. “ under this policy anyone who breaks into the country and has a child the very next moment that child would be made a citizen for life. great. this policy has even created an entire industry of birth tourism, ” trump added. “ big business, where pregnant mothers travel to america to make their children instant american citizens. congress has never passed a law requiring birthright citizenship for illegal aliens and the constitution does not, and i say that to the media, does not require it — read it — because illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the united states. ” the president was in florida on behalf of republican gubernatorial candidate ron desantis and senate candidate rick scott. both are in tight races going into the november 6th election.",1.91343187907e-05,0.499980807304382,0,323,1.86,5.57,7.43,0.62,1.24,5.57,6.5,0.93,1.55,1.55,0.62,0.0,1.86,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.79,0.62,0.0,0.31,1.86,0.31,0.0,2.48,1.24,0.0,0.93,0.93,0.0,0.31,0.0,0.0,0.31,0.0,5.88,1.86,3.72,0.0,0.0,0.31,7.43,4.64,3.1,0.62,5.572755417956656,8.359133126934983,0.9287925696594427
FoxNews,"So, what exactly is the Democratic border security proposal? Would it actually secure the border?
We had some time, so we checked. In a word, no, it would not.
The Democratic bill in the Senate simply restores previous funding levels for the border patrol and other existing programs. So you have to ask yourself, when you consider that, the following: Was the border secure in December, before the shutdown?
No, it was not. That’s why we’re having this debate right now. Then how will it be more secure after a bill that doesn’t change anything passes? Well, it wouldn’t be. That’s the point of the legislation -- to maintain the broken status quo.
Meanwhile, in the House, Homeland Security Committee Chair Bennie Thompson says he plans to introduce a bill that contains billions for border security, but nothing for a wall. Thompson has a brand new idea, he tells us. Thompson says we can secure the border with the marvels of technology. He recently told PBS that cutting-edge machines can help us “identify those vulnerabilities” on the border.
Thompson’s plan can expect enthusiastic support from the congresswoman from Tech Land, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
""The positive, technological wall that can be built is what we should be doing,"" she has said. ""Technology to scan the cars coming through the ports of entry ... and that is to detect guns. It’s like an electronic dog almost to detect drugs, guns and other contraband.""
It’s really like an electronic dog that can detect contraband. On one level, it’s hilarious, and we’ve laughed about it before. But it’s also patronizing, really. You’d have to be totally ignorant of what’s happening at the border to believe that more surveillance is going to solve the problem. We have an awful lot of surveillance technology already. You have drones, cameras, sensors, radar, dirigibles.
We have it all there, in part, because the George W. Bush administration put it there. That administration spent more than a billion dollars on something called the Secure Border Initiative Network. It used technology to watch about 50 miles of our southern border. Congressman Bennie Thompson himself called that program a “grave and expensive disappointment.” Well, Thompson was right about that. What’s changed is that Democrats now support grave and expensive disappointments. They specialize in grave and expensive disappointments. They’re pushing one now.
Democrats have become extremists on the question of borders. You’d never know that from watching television or reading the paper. The media won’t say it. Nor will most Republicans, by the way. Even in the Trump administration, some officials seem intent on making Nancy Pelosi’s case for her, that Republicans are the real extremists here.
That’s shortsighted. Leaving the politics aside, it’s not a good idea because our southern border is one of America’s most dangerous vulnerabilities. That’s not a talking point. It’s literally true. Here’s why: As of this week, Mexico is an intact country. Will it remain an intact country? Maybe. But maybe not.
Mexico is a deeply unstable place. That’s not an attack on the Mexican people; it’s an acknowledgment of what anyone who knows anything about the country will tell you. The national murder rate is five times ours. Since 2006, more than 250,000 people – that’s a quarter million – have been murdered in Mexico, including hundreds of politicians and judges. There’s a war going on in Mexico, and it’s spurred by drug cartels that reach into the highest levels of the Mexican government. That's not an exaggeration.
The attorney general of an entire Mexican state recently pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges. A governor of a state on the U.S. border took bribes to let cartels operate freely, which they did. And just the other day, the country’s previous president was credibly accused by a witness at trial, in court, of taking a $100 million bribe from El Chapo Guzman
In effect, Mexico has become a narcostate. But it’s not even the most volatile country in the region. Nicaragua is in severe turmoil. That gets no coverage, but it’s real. Parts of El Salvador are largely controlled by gangs. Venezuela, meanwhile, is literally falling apart. A recent Brookings Institution report predicted that a total collapse in Venezuela, which could happen any day, might create 8 million refugees. For perspective, that’s more refugees than the ones that fled the entire Syrian Civil War. Keep in mind, that flood of humanity upended all of Europe.
Something similar could easily happen here, to us. It likely will if we ignore the problem, which we are doing. And yet the position of Democrats in Washington is that everything is fine, and you’re nuts if you disagree. Nothing needs to be done. That’s the definition of recklessness. In fact, it’s worse than recklessness. It’s like letting your kids play in traffic. You wouldn’t do that to people you cared about. You’d prevent it from happening.
Democrats have become extremists on the question of borders. You’d never know that from watching television or reading the paper. The media won’t say it. Nor will most Republicans, by the way. Even in the Trump administration, some officials seem intent on making Nancy Pelosi’s case for her, that Republicans are the real extremists here.
Here’s what Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said when asked on another cable news newtwork about workers who aren’t being paid during the shutdown: ""The people might have to pay a little bit of interest, but the idea that it's paycheck or zero is not a really valid idea,"" he said. ""There have been ads run by a number of the public-sector credit unions ... Those have announced very, very low interest-rate loans to bridge people over the gap.""
So, more debt? More interest payments? That’s the solution? No. Those are the last things most Americans need. It was an idiotic thing to say. Look for Wilbur Ross’s words to be aired every day for the next three years on OutletName. They know a propaganda win when they see one.
And it’s a shame. It’s also a distraction because it doesn’t change the fundamental nature of this crisis. Our borders remain vulnerable, and the stakes are higher than they’ve ever been, thanks to the chaos just south of them. Leaders who cared about the country would be staying up late trying to fix the problem. Democratic leaders are trying to make it worse. That’s the bottom line truth.

HuffPost,"For the fourth time in four months, Trump administration officials have refused to let an undocumented immigrant teenager seek an abortion, forcing her to sue to get one, according to a court filing Thursday.
The teenager, who came to the United States without authorization as an unaccompanied minor, alleges in a complaint that she asked to go to a clinic to terminate her pregnancy using her own funds two weeks ago, and has not to be allowed to do so.
It’s yet another example of the Trump administration’s Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) refusing a girl in its custody access to abortion. The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the teenagers, argues the administration’s actions are a violation of the girls’ constitutional rights. The girls’ treatment is a result of policies by ORR Director Scott Lloyd that allow him or other officials to essentially veto immigrant teens’ abortions as long as the individuals are in government custody.
Lloyd described abortion as “killing a human being” in an internal document revealed as part of the broader lawsuit against ORR, referring to a separate case of an immigrant teen seeking an abortion. That teenager was the victim of a rape, and was eventually allowed to terminate her pregnancy after court intervention.
“The Trump administration is effectively banning abortion for these young women,” Brigitte Amiri, senior staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in a statement on Thursday about the latest teen seeking an abortion, referred to as “Jane Moe.”
“We’ve already stopped the government from forcing three other ‘Janes’ to continue pregnancies against their will, but clearly, their heartlessness knows no bounds,” Amiri said. “This administration is blatantly ignoring the fact that the Supreme Court has held that abortion is a fundamental constitutional right.”
ORR officials “have pushed Ms. Moe further into her pregnancy,” according to the complaint filed in court by the ACLU. “Without this Court’s immediate intervention, Defendants will continue to deny Ms. Moe the ability to access abortion, and ultimately will force her to carry to term against her will,” the complaint reads.
The past three teenagers represented by the ACLU were eventually able to obtain abortions against the government’s wishes.
In court, Trump administration officials have argued that they are not blocking teens’ access to abortion, because the individuals in question can agree to return to their native country ― potentially one that bars abortion or that they’ve left to seek asylum in the U.S. ― or be released to a sponsor, something the teens have no control over.","for the fourth time in four months, trump administration officials have refused to let an undocumented immigrant teenager seek an abortion, forcing her to sue to get one, according to a court filing thursday. the teenager, who came to the united states without authorization as an unaccompanied minor, alleges in a complaint that she asked to go to a clinic to terminate her pregnancy using her own funds two weeks ago, and has not to be allowed to do so. it ’ s yet another example of the trump administration ’ s office of refugee resettlement ( orr ) refusing a girl in its custody access to abortion. the american civil liberties union, which is representing the teenagers, argues the administration ’ s actions are a violation of the girls ’ constitutional rights. the girls ’ treatment is a result of policies by orr director scott lloyd that allow him or other officials to essentially veto immigrant teens ’ abortions as long as the individuals are in government custody. lloyd described abortion as “ killing a human being ” in an internal document revealed as part of the broader lawsuit against orr, referring to a separate case of an immigrant teen seeking an abortion. that teenager was the victim of a rape, and was eventually allowed to terminate her pregnancy after court intervention. “ the trump administration is effectively banning abortion for these young women, ” brigitte amiri, senior staff attorney with the aclu reproductive freedom project, said in a statement on thursday about the latest teen seeking an abortion, referred to as “ jane moe. ” “ we ’ ve already stopped the government from forcing three other ‘ janes ’ to continue pregnancies against their will, but clearly, their heartlessness knows no bounds, ” amiri said. “ this administration is blatantly ignoring the fact that the supreme court has held that abortion is a fundamental constitutional right. ” orr officials “ have pushed ms. moe further into her pregnancy, ” according to the complaint filed in court by the aclu. “ without this court ’ s immediate intervention, defendants will continue to deny ms. moe the ability to access abortion, and ultimately will force her to carry to term against her will, ” the complaint reads. the past three teenagers represented by the aclu were eventually able to obtain abortions against the government ’ s wishes. in court, trump administration officials have argued that they are not blocking teens ’ access to abortion, because the individuals in question can agree to return to their native country ― potentially one that bars abortion or that they ’ ve left to seek asylum in the u. s.",0.999980688095092,0.499980745637004,1,417,1.68,2.88,8.63,0.48,0.72,7.43,8.63,0.72,1.68,0.72,1.44,0.24,4.08,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.24,0.0,15.11,0.96,0.0,3.36,0.24,0.24,0.0,2.64,0.24,0.0,4.56,4.08,0.0,4.08,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,6.95,1.2,4.8,0.24,0.0,0.0,5.28,4.32,3.12,1.92,3.597122302158273,9.59232613908873,0.9592326139088728
HuffPost,"The chief executive of the United States recently queried why the country attracted immigrants from “shithole” countries like Haiti rather than more desirable places like Norway. Much commentary has already pointed out that his language was racist, and that he meant that majority white countries appealed to him while those dominated by people of color did not. Placing our leader’s crude comment in historical perspective, he targets for exclusion those countries that were created out of European imperialism and colonization. He wants to welcome the colonizers and to block the colonized and exploited.
To answer his possibly facetious question, the reason why we don’t get more migrants from Norway (and other countries like it) is simple. The residents of Norway enjoy many amenities we lack, such as universal health care and free high-quality education. The United States has neither, with for instance poor health care outcomes accompanied by the world’s highest prices. Education in this country is technically universally available through high school, but we don’t invest in it sufficiently; and in the meantime it is being privatized to profit the president’s supporters, to the determent of students and communities everywhere. Above the level of high school, education in the United States increasingly costs students. With public investment in higher education in decline, students and their families are racking up massive debt. Norway has none of these problems. So, Mr. President, that is why we can’t get migrants from the countries you like. They are wealthy and committed to caring for their populations in ways the United States does not. Nothing in the U.S. pulls them to us, since they are quite contented as a general rule to stay where they are.
We do get more immigrants from countries that are worse off than our own. Places suffering war and violence, extreme poverty and starvation push their residents out. Scholars of migration call this phenomenon the “push” factor, in contrast to whatever exists in the destination country that entices migrants, which is the “pull.” Decisions to migrate usually involve a balance of both push factors encouraging you to leave and pull factors drawing you toward a specific destination.
Generally speaking, the countries with strong push factors are the same countries that were colonized by European countries that the President admires. Beginning in the sixteenth century, Europeans moved out to conquer parts of the world, beginning with the Americas. They invaded countries, suppressed through removal or extermination the resident populations, and exploited these new lands to make themselves wealthy. First, the Spanish extracted massive amounts of mineral wealth from the American territories it controlled. Eventually other Europeans erected sugar plantations that generated wealth for their owners. In all these places, the European colonizers forced non-Europeans to work for them. Using indigenous miners or enslaved African field labor, they created lives of brutality and early death for their labor force in order to profit themselves. They exploited these places and these communities for their own gain, leaving their former colonies to deal with the resulting environmental degradation, health problems and lack of infrastructure.
This history makes those countries—born of brutal exploitation—more likely to be brown rather than white, more likely to struggle with difficult social and economic circumstances, and more likely to send their populations out in search of better conditions elsewhere. Of all the countries in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has arguably the worst history of exploitation and the worst treatment from the Euro-American colonizers of any single place. As St. Dominique, the colony was the single most profitable plantation society, reaping great wealth for France and great degradation for its massive and severely brutalized slave population. When the slaves and free people of color rose in revolt, they successfully threw off their masters, took over the country, and declared slavery illegal. They also renamed their new republic Haiti. The largest successful slave revolt in the Americas, the Haitian Revolution brought freedom but it also prompted a severe backlash. Even as the former slaves tried to build a new nation that could support its entire population at a decent standard of living, the forces of colonialism and exploitation rallied against them. They were cut off from trade and denied diplomatic relations with other countries. Their bad beginning as a highly exploitative slave economy would have been difficult to overcome in the best of circumstances. With the world arrayed against it, the Haitian Republic struggled and failed to create a prosperous economy that could support its populace. Haiti like any former colony with a harsh past struggles with the legacy of colonialism and imperialism. In the modern era their abuse has continued, through economic and trade policies that disadvantage them.","the chief executive of the united states recently queried why the country attracted immigrants from “ shithole ” countries like haiti rather than more desirable places like norway. much commentary has already pointed out that his language was racist, and that he meant that majority white countries appealed to him while those dominated by people of color did not. placing our leader ’ s crude comment in historical perspective, he targets for exclusion those countries that were created out of european imperialism and colonization. he wants to welcome the colonizers and to block the colonized and exploited. to answer his possibly facetious question, the reason why we don ’ t get more migrants from norway ( and other countries like it ) is simple. the residents of norway enjoy many amenities we lack, such as universal health care and free high - quality education. the united states has neither, with for instance poor health care outcomes accompanied by the world ’ s highest prices. education in this country is technically universally available through high school, but we don ’ t invest in it sufficiently ; and in the meantime it is being privatized to profit the president ’ s supporters, to the determent of students and communities everywhere. above the level of high school, education in the united states increasingly costs students. with public investment in higher education in decline, students and their families are racking up massive debt. norway has none of these problems. so, mr. president, that is why we can ’ t get migrants from the countries you like. they are wealthy and committed to caring for their populations in ways the united states does not. nothing in the u. s. pulls them to us, since they are quite contented as a general rule to stay where they are. we do get more immigrants from countries that are worse off than our own. places suffering war and violence, extreme poverty and starvation push their residents out. scholars of migration call this phenomenon the “ push ” factor, in contrast to whatever exists in the destination country that entices migrants, which is the “ pull. ” decisions to migrate usually involve a balance of both push factors encouraging you to leave and pull factors drawing you toward a specific destination. generally speaking, the countries with strong push factors are the same countries that were colonized by european countries that the president admires. beginning in the sixteenth century, europeans moved out to conquer parts of the world, beginning with the americas. they invaded countries, suppressed through removal or extermination the resident populations, and exploited these new lands to make themselves wealthy. first, the spanish extracted massive",0.999976754188537,0.499976767227054,1,431,0.46,3.71,9.74,3.25,0.7,6.03,8.35,1.62,1.62,0.93,1.39,0.0,3.02,0.7,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.31,0.23,0.0,0.0,1.62,0.0,0.7,4.18,2.09,0.0,1.16,0.46,0.0,0.0,0.23,0.23,0.46,0.0,11.6,2.09,8.58,0.23,0.0,0.0,2.78,2.55,4.41,0.23,5.104408352668213,10.904872389791183,1.8561484918793503
HuffPost,"President Donald Trump is doubling down on his demand for border wall funding, but every member of the House of Representatives whose district lies along the proposed barrier refuses to back the idea.
The nine House members who represent border districts from California to Texas each voted in favor of bills to reopen the government without additional money for the wall, OutletName News reported Tuesday. The funding package passed the House last week, but stalled in the GOP-led Senate.
The nine representatives include Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, the only black Republican member of the House.
Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-Texas), who supported the House measures, asked on Monday that Trump “put his calls for a physical barrier to rest.” Gonzalez in November called the wall a “waste of taxpayer dollars.”
Trump this week plans to visit McAllen, Texas, a border city that has garnered a wave of media attention partly for its massive immigration processing center the government has used to separate families.
Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), also dismissed the president’s border security rhetoric, and said on Tuesday “the only crisis at the border is the one manufactured by Donald Trump.”
Rep. Xochitl Torres Small (D-N.M.) has disapproved of Trump’s wall on television and social media.
Trump made clear in his Oval Office address Tuesday that he has no intention of backing down.

CNN,"The American Bar Association is proposing a major overhaul of the US immigration system, calling the courts that decide whether to deport immigrants “irredeemably dysfunctional.” “The immigration courts are facing an existential crisis,” the association says in a report released Wednesday. “The current system is irredeemably dysfunctional and on the brink of collapse.” The only way to fix “serious systemic issues,” the report argues, is to create what’s known as an Article I court. Akin to tax or bankruptcy courts, this would be a court that’s independent from the Justice Department. It’s an idea that’s been proposed before by advocates and immigration judges. And the American Bar Association listed a similar proposal as an option for reform in a 2010 report on the US immigration system. Its report on Wednesday warns that recent policy changes have made a system that was already stretched at the seams even worse. “The state of the U.S. immigration court system has worsened considerably since our 2010 report,” this report notes, specifically mentioning an unprecedented backlog of cases, increased wait times, policy changes that aim to accelerate cases without allocating enough funding, over-reliance on video teleconferencing during court proceedings and possible bias in the hiring of judges. The Justice Department, which runs US immigration courts, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ABA report. But the department has previously addressed some of the issues the ABA report raises. Federal office says progress being made
In a response to questions from Sen. John Cornyn last year, the director of the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review said the department opposes making immigration courts Article I courts. “The financial and logistical hurdles … would be monumental and would likely delay existing cases even further,” James McHenry wrote. And in recent congressional testimony, McHenry said that “considerable progress” had been made in restoring his office’s “reputation as a fully functioning, efficient and impartial administrative court system capable of rendering timely decisions consistent with due process.” McHenry noted that his department had increased its number of case completions for the third consecutive year. And he said that every day, the office decides immigration cases “by fairly, expeditiously and uniformly interpreting and administering the nation’s immigration laws.” Members of the bar association’s immigration commission, who authored the report, warned Wednesday that officials have become overly focused on speed and are overlooking the importance of due process. “While our current immigration system is confronting substantial challenges with respect to delays and backlogs, we would all agree, we must never lose sight of the tenets that underpin our legal system and reflect this country’s values,” said Wendy Wayne, who chairs the commission. “The rights that our laws provide to those subject to our immigration system, those cannot be sacrificed in the name of efficiency.” The report also alleges that judicial independence has been called into question “with a resurgence of alleged politicized hiring and the adoption of policies that arguably undermine immigration judges’ ability to perform their role as a neutral arbitrator of fact and law.” In response to allegations of politicized hiring, a Justice Department official said that at least 51 immigration judges hired under the Trump administration received conditional offers for the positions while President Barack Obama was in office. Bar association reiterates recommendations
The bar association’s report lists more than 100 recommendations, including when video conferencing should be used in court and rescinding the recently imposed quotas and metrics used to evaluate immigration judges. Many of the recommendations were also made in 2010 but were not followed, the report acknowledges. “There have been virtually no new immigration laws addressing issues covered by the 2010 Report, and few of the 2010 recommendations were adopted by either the Obama or the Trump administrations,” it says. “At the same time, certain policies that were in place at the time of the 2010 Report and that promoted the fairness, efficiency, and due process of the immigration system have been undermined.” This time around, the association says it’s recommending “more drastic reforms.” “Recent political and legal developments have exposed the fragility of our administrative systems,” the report says. “Today, our immigration courts and other adjudicative systems face untenable backlogs, yet efforts to reduce those backlogs have been largely ineffective, or, at worst, counterproductive to the goals of an independent judiciary.” More than 800,000 cases are currently pending in US immigration courts, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. At the time of its 2010 report, the ABA says there were about 262,000 cases pending.","the american bar association is proposing a major overhaul of the us immigration system, calling the courts that decide whether to deport immigrants “ irredeemably dysfunctional. ” “ the immigration courts are facing an existential crisis, ” the association says in a report released wednesday. “ the current system is irredeemably dysfunctional and on the brink of collapse. ” the only way to fix “ serious systemic issues, ” the report argues, is to create what ’ s known as an article i court. akin to tax or bankruptcy courts, this would be a court that ’ s independent from the justice department. it ’ s an idea that ’ s been proposed before by advocates and immigration judges. and the american bar association listed a similar proposal as an option for reform in a 2010 report on the us immigration system. its report on wednesday warns that recent policy changes have made a system that was already stretched at the seams even worse. “ the state of the u. s. immigration court system has worsened considerably since our 2010 report, ” this report notes, specifically mentioning an unprecedented backlog of cases, increased wait times, policy changes that aim to accelerate cases without allocating enough funding, over - reliance on video teleconferencing during court proceedings and possible bias in the hiring of judges. the justice department, which runs us immigration courts, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the aba report. but the department has previously addressed some of the issues the aba report raises. federal office says progress being made in a response to questions from sen. john cornyn last year, the director of the justice department ’ s executive office for immigration review said the department opposes making immigration courts article i courts. “ the financial and logistical hurdles … would be monumental and would likely delay existing cases even further, ” james mchenry wrote. and in recent congressional testimony, mchenry said that “ considerable progress ” had been made in restoring his office ’ s “ reputation as a fully functioning, efficient and impartial administrative court system capable of rendering timely decisions consistent with due process. ” mchenry noted that his department had increased its number of case completions for the third consecutive year. and he said that every day, the office decides immigration cases “ by fairly, expeditiously and uniformly interpreting and administering the nation ’ s immigration laws. ” members of the bar association ’ s immigration commission, who authored the report, warned wednesday that officials have become overly focused on speed and are overlooking the importance of due process. “",0.999981641769409,0.499981615315846,1,410,0.73,2.68,6.34,1.71,1.46,3.17,8.54,1.95,2.2,0.73,1.46,0.24,2.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.73,0.0,0.0,7.56,0.98,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.73,3.9,0.73,2.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.83,4.39,3.17,0.73,6.097560975609756,13.658536585365855,0.975609756097561

HuffPost,"White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Sunday continued to push the Trump administration’s false claims that terrorists pour into the U.S. across the border with Mexico. But OutletName’ Chris Wallace wasn’t having it.
Sanders had a heated exchange with the host of “OutletName Sunday” as she discussed President Donald Trump’s threat to continue the partial government shutdown if his demand for $5 billion to fund a U.S.-Mexico border wall isn’t met by Democrats.
“Let’s talk about the wall,” Wallace said. “The president talks about terrorists potentially coming across the border.”
He then showed a clip of Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen stating Friday that “over 3,000 special interest aliens” trying to enter the U.S. from the southern border had been stopped by Border Patrol agents.
“But special interest aliens are just people who have come from countries that have ever produced a terrorist, they’re not terrorists themselves,” Wallace said. He also cited State Department reports that found “no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from Mexico.”
Sanders responded, “We know that roughly nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.”
Wallace, ready to pounce, interrupted Sanders with a blistering fact-check.
“Wait wait, ’cause I know the statistic,” he said. “I didn’t know if you were going to use it, but I studied up on this. Do you know where those 4,000 people come or where they’re captured? Airports.”
The exchange begins below around the 5:35 mark:
“Not always but certainly a large number,” Sanders said as Wallace continued to hammer his point.
“The state department says there hasn’t been any terrorists found coming across the southern border from Mexico,” he added.
Sanders, seemingly ignoring the facts laid out before her, said terrorists enter the U.S. “by air, it’s by land, it’s by sea” and that the southern border is the country’s “most vulnerable point of entry.”
“But they’re not coming across the southern border, Sarah,” Wallace persisted. “They’re coming and they’re being stopped at airports.”
Sanders continued to dance around the facts, saying that terrorists are “coming a number of ways.”
“I’m not disagreeing with you that they’re coming through airports,” she told Wallace. “I’m saying that they come by air by land and by sea, and the more and more that our border becomes vulnerable and the less and less that we spend time and money protecting it, the more that we’re going to have an influx, not just of terrorists, but of human traffickers, drug inflow and people who are coming here to do American citizens harm.”
Trump last month claimed the government had stopped terrorists from entering the U.S. from Mexico, but OutletName reported that no evidence backed up the president’s assertion, according to four government sources.
“People are pouring into our country, including terrorists,” Trump had said. “We have terrorists. We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time. Ten. These are very serious people.”

CNN,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed two executive orders on immigration and border security, which included his campaign promises of building a wall and substantially stepping up deportations and immigration enforcement.
The lengthy orders contained a number of provisions designed to execute key elements of the immigration hard-liner's agenda, including on sanctuary cities, enforcement priorities and cracking down on crime.
""Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders,"" Trump told employees of the Department of Homeland Security at the department's headquarters in Washington, where he signed the orders.
Here's a look at the important pieces of the actions signed Wednesday:
The Wall
The biggest piece of Trump's first executive order was his long-promised wall on the border with Mexico.
The measure instructs the homeland security secretary to take ""steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border,"" in order to ""achieve complete operational control of the southern border.""
The measure includes instructions to figure out funding, including what federal money sources exist now and what the administration will need to request in congressional appropriations later.
The order also calls for a study within six months on securing the southern border.
Trump has said Mexico will pay for the wall, and stood by that Wednesday, saying he would get reimbursement after building the wall with federal funds. Negotiations, he said, would begin ""relatively soon.""
""I'm telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form,"" Trump said. ""We are going to stabilize on both sides of the border and we also understand that a strong and healthy economy in Mexico is very good for the United States.""
The order directed agencies to conduct an analysis of all federal aid to Mexico over the past five years -- previewing Trump's vision for gaining leverage over the neighboring country.
But the order also seemed to indicate that despite Trump repeatedly insisting he meant a physical wall, there was wiggle room.
""'Wall' shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier,"" the order said in its definitions.
Deportation force
Both orders also sought to beef up enforcement agencies in terms of staffing.
The border security order instructed the Department of Homeland Security to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and the other order focused on security of the interior of the nation seeks the addition of 10,000 immigration officers.
Both, however, are ""subject to available appropriations,"" meaning the agency will need to find funds or Congress will need to appropriate them.
The order seeks to get Border Patrol reinforcements to stations ""as soon as is practicable.""
The order also specifies that the additional immigration officers should be trained to perform duties including interrogating, detaining, arresting and searching for people believed to be non-citizens or non-nationals.
Detention centers
The order on border security signals there could be significant efforts to put more immigrants behind bars if they're caught illegally crossing the border, or if they're in deportation proceedings.
The order instructs the secretary of homeland security to construct or establish detention facilities near the border and staff them with asylum officers and immigration judges.
It's unclear how such measures would be funded.
Right now, Congress has appropriated funding for about 34,000 beds for immigrant detention -- many of which are in facilities operated by private companies across the country. Meanwhile more than half a million cases are pending in immigration court.
Wednesday's order directs the secretary of homeland security to ""allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control or establish contracts to construct, operate or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.""
It's likely private prison companies, which saw their stock go up after Trump's election, will be involved.
End 'catch and release'
One of the touted elements of the orders is ending what Trump calls ""catch and release,"" in essence guaranteeing immigrants who could be removed from the country are continuously detained and not let free based on humanitarian concerns.
""It is the policy of the executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens,"" the order states.
The section is heavily technical, but orders the homeland security secretary to ensure that allowances in US immigration law to grant individuals asylum or parole based on concerns about persecution in their home country are not ""exploited"" to block deportations.
The provisions should only be used ""when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole,"" the order states.
This portion of the order also notes that unaccompanied children detained at the border receive care and are sent back to their home nations as appropriate.
A flood of unaccompanied children at the border created a crisis in recent years, as detention facilities were unable to humanely accommodate high numbers. The increased influx of minors crossing the border without adults were largely fleeing violence in Central America.
Sanctuary cities
Trump's ""interior"" security order takes aim at so-called sanctuary jurisdictions -- cities, states and other entities that through a range of policies shield undocumented immigrants from federal law enforcement.
The order will ""strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants,"" according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer in his daily briefing.
The order declares that entities labeled ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" by the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security will be ""not eligible"" for federal grants, and it directs the Office of Management and Budget to compile federal grant money currently going to sanctuary jurisdictions.
The order appears to apply mostly to future federal grants, though after OMB's review, Spicer explained that the funding identified could be taken away.
While the administration likely can't cut off all federal funding, as much of it is disbursed through Congress, the President could put some pressure on cities this way.
Any attempts to enact this provision will almost certainly face a legal challenge -- past court rulings have weighed in on the government stripping funds from states and cities to enforce policies and have found the measures must relate to the policy in question, must promote the general welfare and cannot be coercive.
Enforcement priorities
Trump's been saying he wants to prioritize deporting criminals for months. That's no surprise; so did President Barack Obama. But Trump's executive order Wednesday took a sweeping approach to defining ""criminal.""
The ""interior"" order lays out new enforcement priorities for the government, which go far beyond what the Obama administration followed.
The order says the priority will be removing deportable immigrants who ""have been convicted of any criminal offense; have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved; have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency; have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or in the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.""
Based on the wording of the executive order, a criminal could include someone who's charged with -- but not actually convicted -- of a crime.
The last provisions apparently include anyone who an immigration official feels endangers ""public safety or national security,"" even if that person doesn't face charges -- giving wide latitude to officers.
And the term ""criminal offense,"" isn't defined in the order and could include a wide range of charges, including presumably misdemeanors.
This part of the executive order is also likely to face legal challenges from civil liberties and immigrant rights advocates, who have long argued the government's approach to handling immigration cases violates due process
Secure communities
Trump's executive order revives a controversial program that ended during the Obama administration.
The ""Secure Communities"" program requires local authorities to share fingerprints and other arrest data to help track down undocumented immigrants.
Critics said it pitted law enforcement against the communities they were charged with protecting by putting immigration enforcement in the hands of local police. They also claimed it led to the deportations of immigrants who were in the United States illegally but had no criminal arrest records.
Supporters said it helped authorities catch criminals who might otherwise fall through the cracks.
Wednesday's order rolls back Obama's Priority Enforcement Program and reinstates ""Secure Communities.""
International pressure
The ""interior"" order also includes a provision on ""recalcitrant countries"" -- a technical way of describing nations that do not cooperate in taking back nationals the US is seeking to deport.
The order directs the secretaries of homeland security and state to put heavy pressure on those countries, including by levying sanctions against them.
The State Department should also engage in the ""maximum"" legal pressure through diplomacy and negotiations, the order says.
Mark Toner, acting State Department spokesman, said the department was reviewing the order and would work to implement it ""immediately.""
""Facilitating the removal of aliens who are subject to a final order of removal, particularly those who pose a danger to national security or public safety, is a top priority for the Department of State,"" Toner said.
He also cited work done by State on the issue under the Obama administration.
""In FY2015, US government authorities successfully facilitated the repatriation of 235,413 foreign nationals. Stepped-up diplomatic efforts by ICE and the State Department have resulted in significant increases in cooperation among the 23 countries currently on ICE's Uncooperative ('Recalcitrant') list, with nearly half of these countries improving their records of issuing travel documents, accepting charter deportee flights with deportees, and agreeing on formal arrangements for future removals in recent months,"" he said.
Publicizing crimes
The ""interior"" order contains two provisions to increase the public reporting of crimes related to illegal immigration.
One provision directs US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to create an ""Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens.""
The office would offer services to victims of such crimes and to their family members, and would provide reports quarterly ""studying the effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States.""
Regarding sanctuary cities, another provision seeks ""to better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions,"" by using a weekly report to publish a list of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants and name and shame jurisdictions that ignored detention requests in relation to them.
Trump often spoke on the trail of individuals who lost loved ones allegedly at the hands of undocumented immigrants. One such case, the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco, has been a central rallying cry of sanctuary city opponents and advocates of restricting immigration.
""I have no higher duty than to protect the lives of the American people. First, these families lost their loved ones, then they endured a system that ignore them, while at the same time constantly rewarding those who broke the law,"" Trump said at the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday. ""For these families it has been one injustice after another, but that all turns around beginning today. We are joined here this afternoon my parents whose children were horribly killed by individuals living here illegally.""","president donald trump on wednesday signed two executive orders on immigration and border security, which included his campaign promises of building a wall and substantially stepping up deportations and immigration enforcement. the lengthy orders contained a number of provisions designed to execute key elements of the immigration hard - liner's agenda, including on sanctuary cities, enforcement priorities and cracking down on crime.

"" "" i'm telling you there will be a payment. it will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form, "" trump said.

HuffPost,"Teachers and parents plan to take to the streets on May 1 to call for investment in public education and to protest President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.
The nation’s two major teachers unions and a coalition of education groups called the Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools are coordinating protests at schools across the U.S. The protests ― the culmination of a weeks-long national campaign called “Build Schools, Not Walls” ― will call on elected officials to invest money in education, rather than in hurtful immigration policies like a wall between the United States and Mexico.
Labor and immigration advocates also plan to demonstrate around the country on May 1. Leaders of the education protests say they are joining the other groups in solidarity and expect hundreds of thousands of people to participate in events held at more than 2,000 schools nationwide.
AROS represents a coalition of national and grassroots education groups across the country. Since Trump’s election and the confirmation of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, members have been exceptionally mobilized, according to Keron Blair, AROS’ executive director. The latest campaign, which launches Tuesday, seeks to capitalize on this momentum and link the movements for education and immigrant justice.
In the upcoming weeks, AROS’ campaign plans to call on leaders to end the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, and to ensure that schools are safe places for all students ― no matter what their immigration status.
“For us, it is really about the vision that instead of investing billions of dollars in a wall that divides our community, what we really should be doing is investing heavily in great public schools for our children,” said Blair, whose coalition represents groups like the Advancement Project and the Center for Popular Democracy.
The campaign plans to kick off at a high school in Dearborn, Michigan, with leaders like Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, and Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.). The Dearborn school is “fairly well-resourced,” Blair said, but it is not representative of the overall state of public education in Michigan.
Michigan, which is DeVos’ home state, has low rates of academic achievement. Critics say this is partly because of policies pushed by DeVos herself. DeVos is a proponent of policies that expand access to charter schools and private schools. Critics say such policies hurt traditional public schools.
In response to DeVos’ confirmation, Blair said there has been an increase in engagement from people who want to protect public education.","teachers and parents plan to take to the streets on may 1 to call for investment in public education and to protest president donald trump ’ s immigration policies. the nation ’ s two major teachers unions and a coalition of education groups called the alliance to reclaim our schools are coordinating protests at schools across the u. s. the protests ― the culmination of a weeks - long national campaign called “ build schools, not walls ” ― will call on elected officials to invest money in education, rather than in hurtful immigration policies like a wall between the united states and mexico. labor and immigration advocates also plan to demonstrate around the country on may 1. leaders of the education protests say they are joining the other groups in solidarity and expect hundreds of thousands of people to participate in events held at more than 2, 000 schools nationwide. aros represents a coalition of national and grassroots education groups across the country. since trump ’ s election and the confirmation of education secretary betsy devos, members have been exceptionally mobilized, according to keron blair, aros ’ executive director. the latest campaign, which launches tuesday, seeks to capitalize on this momentum and link the movements for education and immigrant justice. in the upcoming weeks, aros ’ campaign plans to call on leaders to end the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, and to ensure that schools are safe places for all students ― no matter what their immigration status. “ for us, it is really about the vision that instead of investing billions of dollars in a wall that divides our community, what we really should be doing is investing heavily in great public schools for our children, ” said blair, whose coalition represents groups like the advancement project and the center for popular democracy. the campaign plans to kick off at a high school in dearborn, michigan, with leaders like randi weingarten, president of the american federation of teachers, and rep. debbie dingell ( d - mich. ). the dearborn school is “ fairly well - resourced, ” blair said, but it is not representative of the overall state of public education in michigan. michigan, which is devos ’ home state, has low rates of academic achievement. critics say this is partly because of policies pushed by devos herself. devos is a proponent of policies that expand access to charter schools and private schools. critics say such policies hurt traditional public schools. in response to devos ’ confirmation, blair said there has been an increase in engagement from people who want to protect public education.",0.999976158142089,0.499976183298713,1,415,2.41,4.1,9.16,3.86,1.45,3.86,6.75,0.96,0.72,0.48,0.48,0.48,2.41,0.0,0.48,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.42,0.72,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.24,9.88,1.45,0.24,0.48,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48,0.48,9.16,0.96,6.75,0.24,0.0,0.72,2.41,2.17,3.37,1.69,7.710843373493977,8.433734939759036,1.9277108433734942
Daily Caller,"The high-stakes legal struggle over President Donald Trump’s executive order on refugees and migrants has reached the Supreme Court.
The Department of Justice filed an emergency petition at the Supreme Court late Thursday, asking the justices to allow enforcement of the president’s executive order and overturn a lower court ruling barring the directive’s imposition.
In a 10-3 ruling last week, the full 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that President Trump’s order is objectively lawful. The panel nonetheless concluded it was unconstitutional in this instance, because Trump’s stated national security interest in issuing the order was little more than a pretext for discriminating against Muslims.
“That remarkable holding is wrong and in manifest need of this Court’s review,” the Department wrote in its petition. The 4th Circuit’s ruling leaves the provision of the order barring migration from six countries with high instances of terrorism under injunction.
DOJ asked the justices to set aside the ruling and schedule the case for oral arguments. They also requested that the Court lift an injunction issued by a federal judge in Hawaii which bars enforcement of key provisions of the order.
The Justice Department issued a statement shortly after the petitions were filed.
“We have asked the Supreme Court to hear this important case and are confident that President Trump’s executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism,” said spokeswomen Sarah Isgur Flores. “The president is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism.”
Four justices must agree to take the case in order to initiate Supreme Court review, though five votes are necessary to overturn lower court orders barring enforcement of Trump’s directive. Therefore, the Court may take the case while allowing injunctions enjoining the order to stand. The justices will likely issue a decision regarding the stay requests in short order, though a decision as to whether to review the case will take longer.
Timing could quickly become a hindrance for the Department. The Supreme Court sits from early October to the end of June, and is no longer scheduling cases for arguments during this term. Therefore, should the justices agree to take the case, it may not be heard until late this year. This long timeframe is especially detrimental to the government’s case, as it could undermine the administration’s argument that the order was motivated by urgent threats to national security.
Still, the government argues the courts must defer to the president’s national security findings, and blasted the 4th Circuit for imputing discriminatory intent on the basis of the president’s campaign statements. In its ruling last week, the court found that the president’s campaign season rhetoric evinces an intent to discriminate against Muslims.
“This Court has never invalidated religion-neutral government action based on speculation about officials’ subjective motivations drawn from campaign-trail statements by a political candidate,” the Department wrote.
In closing, the Department repeated an admonition offered by acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall at the conclusion of his arguments before the 4th Circuit. Wall gently reminded the court that the intense controversies the case occasions should not obscure the fundamental issue at hand — the scope of the president’s immigration and national security powers. The Department writes:
“[T]he precedent set by this case for the judiciary’s proper role in reviewing the President’s national-security and immigration authority will transcend this debate, this Order, and this constitutional moment. Precisely in cases that spark such intense feelings, it is all the more critical to adhere to foundational legal rules. The decision below departs from those rules, and calls into question the Executive and his authority in a way that warrants this Court’s review.”
A ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on the president’s second order is still pending as of this writing. It is not clear what the 9th Circuit will do should the justices issue a decision on DOJ’s petition before they issue their own ruling.","the high - stakes legal struggle over president donald trump ’ s executive order on refugees and migrants has reached the supreme court. the department of justice filed an emergency petition at the supreme court late thursday, asking the justices to allow enforcement of the president ’ s executive order and overturn a lower court ruling barring the directive ’ s imposition. in a 10 - 3 ruling last week, the full 4th u. s. circuit court of appeals found that president trump ’ s order is objectively lawful. the panel nonetheless concluded it was unconstitutional in this instance, because trump ’ s stated national security interest in issuing the order was little more than a pretext for discriminating against muslims. “ that remarkable holding is wrong and in manifest need of this court ’ s review, ” the department wrote in its petition. the 4th circuit ’ s ruling leaves the provision of the order barring migration from six countries with high instances of terrorism under injunction. doj asked the justices to set aside the ruling and schedule the case for oral arguments. they also requested that the court lift an injunction issued by a federal judge in hawaii which bars enforcement of key provisions of the order. the justice department issued a statement shortly after the petitions were filed. “ we have asked the supreme court to hear this important case and are confident that president trump ’ s executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism, ” said spokeswomen sarah isgur flores. “ the president is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism. ” four justices must agree to take the case in order to initiate supreme court review, though five votes are necessary to overturn lower court orders barring enforcement of trump ’ s directive. therefore, the court may take the case while allowing injunctions enjoining the order to stand. the justices will likely issue a decision regarding the stay requests in short order, though a decision as to whether to review the case will take longer. timing could quickly become a hindrance for the department. the supreme court sits from early october to the end of june, and is no longer scheduling cases for arguments during this term. therefore, should the justices agree to take the case, it may not be heard until late this year. this long timeframe is especially detrimental to the government ’ s case, as it could undermine the administration ’ s argument that the order was motivated by urgent threats to national security. still, the government argues the courts must defer to the president ’ s national security findings,",0.999950647354126,0.499950689507386,0,435,2.07,3.68,15.17,0.69,0.46,14.02,8.74,2.76,1.15,1.38,0.92,0.0,2.3,0.23,0.69,0.0,0.69,0.0,10.34,0.0,0.0,0.23,0.23,0.23,0.0,3.45,0.0,0.23,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.38,5.98,0.46,5.52,0.0,0.46,0.0,5.75,3.45,2.3,0.92,9.195402298850574,10.574712643678161,1.1494252873563218
Breitbart,"President Donald Trump vowed to border patrol agents that he would deliver a wall on the southern border, renewing his commitment to border security.
“A real wall, not a little wall … they have them; they don’t work,” Trump said. “You need a real wall that will work 99.9 percent.”
Trump made his remarks during a tour of the Border Patrol National Targeting Center on Friday in Virginia. He spoke to many of the agents and held a roundtable with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
Trump reemphasized his commitment to supporting the agents on the border and the DHS personnel.
“I just want to let you know that the Trump administration is with you folks 100 percent,” he said. “You have not been backed up properly, and everybody knows it. For political reasons, for lots of different reasons. But the Trump administration is with you.”
Nielsen agreed that a wall would be built, but specified that the money requested by his administration would be used to provide more border technology and agents.
“We’re going to build you one,” she said, referring to the wall funding request of $25 billion. “We have a very specific and targeted way in which we will use that money to build a border wall system. Just not just that infrastructure, but the technology and personnel that go with it.”
Nielsen even brought graphics to the briefing, showing Trump how border walls work.
“We’ve seen it, we have evidence, we know that they work,” she said.
Trump again cited the four principals of his immigration reform framework, which includes securing the border, closing loopholes, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery.
ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan, who was also at the briefing, thanked Trump for visiting the facility and empowering his agents.
“For the American heroes sitting behind you, we thank you for letting us do our job,” he said.
He informed the president that since he took office, border crossings were at a 45-year low.
“That just shows you that when we’re allowed to enforce law, we’re going to have an impact,” he said.
Trump said lightly that it was a “great number” but that he was still “very unhappy” about it.
“That’s impressive nevertheless,” he said, as the agents laughed. “But you’ll do much better, good luck.”","president donald trump vowed to border patrol agents that he would deliver a wall on the southern border, renewing his commitment to border security. “ a real wall, not a little wall … they have them ; they don ’ t work, ” trump said. “ you need a real wall that will work 99. 9 percent. ” trump made his remarks during a tour of the border patrol national targeting center on friday in virginia. he spoke to many of the agents and held a roundtable with homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen. trump reemphasized his commitment to supporting the agents on the border and the dhs personnel. “ i just want to let you know that the trump administration is with you folks 100 percent, ” he said. “ you have not been backed up properly, and everybody knows it. for political reasons, for lots of different reasons. but the trump administration is with you. ” nielsen agreed that a wall would be built, but specified that the money requested by his administration would be used to provide more border technology and agents. “ we ’ re going to build you one, ” she said, referring to the wall funding request of $ 25 billion. “ we have a very specific and targeted way in which we will use that money to build a border wall system. just not just that infrastructure, but the technology and personnel that go with it. ” nielsen even brought graphics to the briefing, showing trump how border walls work. “ we ’ ve seen it, we have evidence, we know that they work, ” she said. trump again cited the four principals of his immigration reform framework, which includes securing the border, closing loopholes, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery. ice acting director thomas homan, who was also at the briefing, thanked trump for visiting the facility and empowering his agents. “ for the american heroes sitting behind you, we thank you for letting us do our job, ” he said. he informed the president that since he took office, border crossings were at a 45 - year low. “ that just shows you that when we ’ re allowed to enforce law, we ’ re going to have an impact, ” he said. trump said lightly that it was a “ great number ” but that he was still “ very unhappy ” about it. “ that ’ s impressive nevertheless, ” he said, as the agents laughed. “ but you ’ ll do much better, good luck. ”",8.54502213769e-05,0.499914526939392,0,392,2.04,3.57,7.91,3.32,1.79,3.32,8.67,2.04,2.3,1.28,0.0,0.51,3.06,0.51,0.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.15,0.26,0.0,0.51,3.83,0.0,0.0,4.59,1.02,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.26,1.02,8.93,0.77,7.4,0.77,0.0,0.26,1.79,5.87,1.28,1.53,5.357142857142857,11.989795918367346,2.295918367346939
HuffPost,"The Trump administration asked a federal judge on Friday to uphold the constitutionality of the controversial state immigration crackdown passed by the Republican-dominated Texas legislature.
The U.S. government isn’t a party in the lawsuit challenging Texas Senate Bill 4, which bans so-called sanctuary policies that limit local police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. But the Texas law has become a prominent test of whether courts will approve strong-arm tactics endorsed by President Donald Trump to pressure local jurisdictions into complying with federal deportation efforts.
“President Trump has made a commitment to keep America safe and to ensure cooperation with federal immigration laws,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement Friday. “The Department of Justice fully supports Texas’s effort and is participating in this lawsuit because of the strong federal interest in facilitating the state and local cooperation that is critical in enforcing our nation’s immigration laws.”
SB 4 bars local jurisdictions in Texas from denying requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold suspected undocumented immigrants on the federal government’s behalf. Adopting a policy of refusing such requests, known as “detainers,” can land public officials in jail for up to a year under the new law. SB 4 also allows local police officers to ask the immigration status of anyone they stop, drawing comparisons to an Arizona law derided by critics as the “show me your papers” law.
Several jurisdictions ― including Austin, San Antonio and El Paso ― filed lawsuits to overturn SB 4 shortly after Gov. Greg Abbott signed it into law last month.
The legal challenges accuse Republican lawmakers of trampling multiple constitutional principles.
Several federal judges have ruled in recent years that holding someone on an ICE detainer in a local jail if they would otherwise be allowed to go free violates the Fourth Amendment’s guarantees against illegal search and seizure. And because the federal government alone is charged with crafting immigration policy, the state of Texas can’t create its own, or dole out criminal penalties for refusing to follow a state policy, critics argue.
The flurry of lawsuits were consolidated into a single case that will have its first hearing on Monday, when U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia will consider whether to block the law from taking effect on Sept. 1 while the legal challenges move forward.
The Justice Department will try to convince the judge to give the law a chance.
“Cooperation with federal officials is plainly permitted under the [Immigration and Nationality Act] and the Constitution,” the statement of interest filed by DOJ reads. “Parties may disagree with the state legislature’s policy determinations in enacting SB 4, but nothing in federal immigration law precludes a state from directing law enforcement officers in the state to cooperate with the federal government, rather than merely permitting them to do so on an ad hoc basis.”
The filing hinges on the argument that ICE detainers have changed in the months since Trump took office. The Department of Homeland Security started issuing administrative arrest warrants in April, along with detainer requests, in an apparent effort to make ICE holds less vulnerable to legal challenges.
That argument may not convince Garcia. He ruled earlier this month that the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office in Texas violated the Fourth Amendment by refusing to release an undocumented immigrant for more than two months on the basis of an ICE detainer. The ruling appeared to strike a major blow against SB 4, which aims to force local jurisdictions to honor all such requests from ICE.
The Justice Department’s filing took note of that ruling, but countered that the case began last year, before Trump took office. The Trump administration’s new policy of including administrative warrants with ICE detainers solves the problem and is “fully consistent with the Fourth Amendment,” the filing says.
But avoiding the constitutional pitfalls presented by ICE detainers requires a warrant in a criminal case, not an administrative warrant for a violation of civil immigration law, according to Nina Perales, an attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
“The Fourth Amendment in this context requires probable cause that the individual has committed a crime in order to deprive that person of liberty,” Perales, one of several lawyers representing SB 4’s opponents, told OutletName. “DOJ cannot hang its hat on the new detainer form when it comes to the stringent requirements of the Fourth Amendment.”","the trump administration asked a federal judge on friday to uphold the constitutionality of the controversial state immigration crackdown passed by the republican - dominated texas legislature. the u. s. government isn ’ t a party in the lawsuit challenging texas senate bill 4, which bans so - called sanctuary policies that limit local police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. but the texas law has become a prominent test of whether courts will approve strong - arm tactics endorsed by president donald trump to pressure local jurisdictions into complying with federal deportation efforts. “ president trump has made a commitment to keep america safe and to ensure cooperation with federal immigration laws, ” attorney general jeff sessions said in a statement friday. “ the department of justice fully supports texas ’ s effort and is participating in this lawsuit because of the strong federal interest in facilitating the state and local cooperation that is critical in enforcing our nation ’ s immigration laws. ” sb 4 bars local jurisdictions in texas from denying requests from immigration and customs enforcement to hold suspected undocumented immigrants on the federal government ’ s behalf. adopting a policy of refusing such requests, known as “ detainers, ” can land public officials in jail for up to a year under the new law. sb 4 also allows local police officers to ask the immigration status of anyone they stop, drawing comparisons to an arizona law derided by critics as the “ show me your papers ” law. several jurisdictions ― including austin, san antonio and el paso ― filed lawsuits to overturn sb 4 shortly after gov. greg abbott signed it into law last month. the legal challenges accuse republican lawmakers of trampling multiple constitutional principles. several federal judges have ruled in recent years that holding someone on an ice detainer in a local jail if they would otherwise be allowed to go free violates the fourth amendment ’ s guarantees against illegal search and seizure. and because the federal government alone is charged with crafting immigration policy, the state of texas can ’ t create its own, or dole out criminal penalties for refusing to follow a state policy, critics argue. the flurry of lawsuits were consolidated into a single case that will have its first hearing on monday, when u. s. district judge orlando garcia will consider whether to block the law from taking effect on sept. 1 while the legal challenges move forward. the justice department will try to convince the judge to give the law a chance. “ cooperation with federal officials is plainly permitted under the [ immigration and nationality act ] and the constitution, ” the statement of interest filed by doj reads. “ parties may",0.99996793270111,0.499967895972077,1,434,1.84,2.53,16.36,1.84,1.84,12.9,7.6,1.15,1.84,0.92,1.38,0.46,2.07,0.0,0.23,0.0,0.23,0.0,11.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.69,0.0,2.53,0.0,0.0,0.46,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23,7.83,0.69,6.45,0.23,0.23,0.0,3.23,2.3,2.53,1.15,10.138248847926267,10.829493087557603,1.1520737327188941
Breitbart,"The “Gang of Six” amnesty for millions of illegal aliens shielded from deportation by the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program should be rolled “straight into the trash can,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) says.
On Wednesday, a group of six pro-amnesty Senators will roll out their expansive immigration amnesty plan that would not only give a pathway to U.S. citizenship beginning with 3.5 million DACA and DACA-eligible illegal aliens but also give amnesty to the parents of amnesty beneficiaries.
Cotton — whose popular legal immigration-cutting RAISE Act was endorsed by President Trump in 2017 — slammed the “Gang of Six” amnesty, saying it was dead on arrival.
Might as well roll it straight into the trash can … mass amnesty far beyond DACA, fake border security, no end to chain migration. ://t.co/pkpCrJxXfa — Tom Cotton () January 17, 2018
A memo on the expansive amnesty plan reveals that the legislation would:
Give DACA and DACA-eligible illegal aliens a pathway to U.S. citizenship
Give amnesty to the parents of DACA illegal aliens
Make no cuts to legal immigration levels, whereby more than one million legal immigrants enter the U.S. every year
Transfers the 50,000 visas through the Diversity Visa Lottery into two other visa categories
Does not fund the estimated $18 billion U.S.-Mexico border wall
Does not mandate E-Verify to bar employers from hiring illegal aliens over American workers
Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Jessica Vaughan wrote in an op-ed that the “Gang of Six” amnesty plan is “not a serious effort to find common ground with either the majority of congressional Republicans or the president,” as it does not meet the pro-American immigration reform requirements that have been laid out by the Trump administration.
A DACA amnesty is likely to trigger a border surge of potentially one million illegal aliens trying to cross the southern border into the U.S., as OutletName News reported.
As the Migration Policy Institute has chronicled, previous border surges from amnesty programs have brought hundreds of thousands across the U.S.-Mexico border:
While the flow of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) has been climbing steadily since 2012, a dramatic surge has taken place in the last six months, with the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas as the principal place of entry. The Border Patrol there has converted entire stations to house unaccompanied minors and families. According to the Border Patrol, apprehensions of unaccompanied children increased from 16,067 in fiscal year (FY) 2011 to 24,481 in FY 2012 and 38,833 in FY 2013. During the first eight months of FY 2014, 47,017 such children were apprehended by the Border Patrol. If the influx continues apace—and it shows no signs of slowing—the administration predicts that by the end of the fiscal year on September 30, totals could reach 90,000. Ninety-eight percent of unaccompanied minors currently arriving at the border are from Honduras (28 percent), Mexico (25 percent), Guatemala (24 percent), and El Salvador (21 percent). This breakdown represents a significant shift: prior to 2012, more than 75 percent of UACs were from Mexico.
As OutletName News reported, should the current legal immigration system not be changed over the next 50 years, the U.S. is on track to add 100 million foreign-born individuals to the country. In the next 20 years, the current legal immigration system is on track to import 15 million new foreign-born voters to the U.S.","the “ gang of six ” amnesty for millions of illegal aliens shielded from deportation by the president obama - created deferred action for childhood arrivals ( daca ) program should be rolled “ straight into the trash can, ” sen. tom cotton ( r - ar ) says. on wednesday, a group of six pro - amnesty senators will roll out their expansive immigration amnesty plan that would not only give a pathway to u. s. citizenship beginning with 3. 5 million daca and daca - eligible illegal aliens but also give amnesty to the parents of amnesty beneficiaries. cotton — whose popular legal immigration - cutting raise act was endorsed by president trump in 2017 — slammed the “ gang of six ” amnesty, saying it was dead on arrival. might as well roll it straight into the trash can … mass amnesty far beyond daca, fake border security, no end to chain migration. : / / t. co / pkpcrjxxfa — tom cotton ( ) january 17, 2018 a memo on the expansive amnesty plan reveals that the legislation would : give daca and daca - eligible illegal aliens a pathway to u. s. citizenship give amnesty to the parents of daca illegal aliens make no cuts to legal immigration levels, whereby more than one million legal immigrants enter the u. s. every year transfers the 50, 000 visas through the diversity visa lottery into two other visa categories does not fund the estimated $ 18 billion u. s. - mexico border wall does not mandate e - verify to bar employers from hiring illegal aliens over american workers center for immigration studies director of policy jessica vaughan wrote in an op - ed that the “ gang of six ” amnesty plan is “ not a serious effort to find common ground with either the majority of congressional republicans or the president, ” as it does not meet the pro - american immigration reform requirements that have been laid out by the trump administration. a daca amnesty is likely to trigger a border surge of potentially one million illegal aliens trying to cross the southern border into the u. s., as outletname news reported. as the migration policy institute has chronicled, previous border surges from amnesty programs have brought hundreds of thousands across the u. s. - mexico border : while the flow of unaccompanied alien children ( uacs ) has been climbing steadily since 2012, a dramatic surge has taken place in the last six months, with the rio grande valley in south texas as the principal place of entry. the border patrol there has converted entire stations to house unaccomp",2.0855157345e-05,0.499979138374328,0,406,5.91,5.67,7.14,1.23,1.72,4.19,7.14,1.23,0.74,1.48,1.23,0.0,2.71,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.87,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,3.69,0.49,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.25,0.49,12.32,3.45,8.62,0.25,0.0,0.0,2.96,2.71,3.94,1.48,6.896551724137931,8.374384236453201,0.49261083743842365

Daily Caller,"Texas Democratic senatorial candidate Rep. Beto O’Rourke accused President Donald Trump on Tuesday of trying to “stoke paranoia and fear” just ahead of the midterm elections.
While appearing on an MSOutletName town hall, Chris Matthews asked O’Rourke for his thoughts on Trump’s plans to issue an executive order ending birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants.
“Interesting that he drops this proposal with a week to go until the Nov. 6 election,” O’Rourke replied.
During a Monday TV interview, Trump announced his intentions to sidestep adding a constitutional amendment to modify the 14th Amendment’s provision of birthright citizenship for persons born in the United States. O’Rourke pivoted away from Trump’s executive order proposal and brought up the more than 5,000 person migrant caravan that is traveling through Mexico with the hope of claiming asylum in the U.S.
“Interesting that he tries to stoke paranoia and fear about a group of migrants who are still hundreds of miles, weeks away from the U.S.-Mexico border if they even make it this far,” O’Rourke said.
“I think he’s trying to play upon the worst impulses of this country instead of speaking to our ambitions, our hopes, our dreams — those things that we can achieve if we all come together, so I don’t know what he’s trying to do, I just know the task left to us, which is to be the answer to that,” he continued.

HuffPost,"Young undocumented immigrants watched on Monday as Senate Democrats did something many of them had promised not to: cast votes for government spending without securing protections for so-called Dreamers at risk of deportation.
Dreamer activists felt betrayed. Sitting in the gallery above the Senate floor, 33-year-old Karina Ruiz started to cry when she watched the first vote to end the government shutdown.
“I really [had] hopes and expectations that Democrats would hold the line for us, that they would hold their vote,” Ruiz, executive director of Arizona Dream Act Coalition and a mother of three, said afterwards. “We would send a message that this is urgent.”
For months, undocumented immigrants have urged Democrats to oppose government funding bills unless they did something to help Dreamers, about 700,000 of whom will lose deportation relief because President Donald Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
Senate Democrats stood with Dreamers on Friday and voted against a four-week spending bill, but just days later on Monday they agreed to a three-week measure, insisting it wasn’t a cave because they had received a promise from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that he would hold a vote on a DACA protection bill if one hadn’t passed by Feb. 8.
The deal wasn’t nothing. But it wasn’t what Dreamers asked for, or what Democrats promised. So on Monday, these undocumented immigrants were left in search of a way forward in a battle that has extended far longer than many had hoped, keeping them in Washington and away from family, school and work.
After Monday’s vote, more than 50 Dreamers gathered in a park across from the Capitol in a circle, some of them holding back tears and putting their arms around each another. Greisa Martinez Rosas, advocacy director for the Dreamer-led group United We Dream, asked them to raise a hand if they felt disappointed. Everyone did.
She then asked them to take a step forward for a series of prompts. They stepped toward the center when she asked if they believed in their hearts that they would win the fight for protections, and again when she said they would not allow politicians to lie to them, and again when she said they are worthy and loved. She asked them to send love to Republicans who oppose their cause and forgiveness to Democrats who lost their spine.
“We’re not done,” Martinez Rosas said before leading the group in a battle cry.
Elise Foley A group of Dreamer activists huddle after the Senate voted to move forward with a government funding bill even though it did not include immigration measures.
It was an especially difficult day for Antonio Jauregui, a 20-year-old college student who came to the U.S. when he was five, because it is the one-year anniversary of his grandfather’s death. He said he’d like to be at home with family in California to remember and honor his grandfather, but instead has been in Washington for weeks pleading with lawmakers to fight for him.
Jauregui had DACA protections but they expired in September and his renewal application was caught in postal delays. His application is now pending, but in the meantime, he is at risk, just like an estimated 122 other DACA recipients across the country who lose protections each day.
He was disappointed by Monday’s events and the fact that Democrats agreed to move forward on a short-term government funding bill based only on a promise for a future immigration vote.
“Promises aren’t going to protect our community,” Jauregui said. “Promises aren’t going to grant us a permanent solution. Promises aren’t going to do anything for the DACA recipients like myself who have already lost status. We were really counting on their actions.”
Isaias Guerrero, a 33-year-old who works with the Fair Immigration Reform Movement advocacy group, still has DACA protection for another 602 days. He knows because he has a countdown on his computer and has been watching the days tick down since Trump rescinded the program.

CNN,"Illinois Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker signed a bill on Friday that bans private immigration detention centers in the state, making it the first in the nation to forbid the practice, according to a release from the governor's office.
Pritzker signed the legislation, HB 2040, as part of a three-part package to protect undocumented immigrants, as the state braces for Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids that are expected in Chicago and nine other major cities starting Sunday.
Private detention centers have become popular, particularly close to the southern border, as Customs and Border Protection struggles to deal with the influx of migrants and refugees entering the United States. The private-prison industry as a whole is benefiting from Trump's border policies.

FoxNews,"U.S. immigration officials said Sunday that the San Diego border crossing where hundreds of Central American immigrants intended to apply for asylum was closed due to high capacity -- but many of the asylum-seekers were preparing to wait overnight. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said earlier Sunday that the agency ""reached capacity at the San Ysidro port of entry for CBP officers to be able to bring additional persons traveling without appropriate entry documentation into the port of entry for processing."" Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told OutletName in a statement that immigrants ""may need to wait in Mexico as CBP officers work to process those already within our facilities."" Hundreds of migrants involved in a caravan to the United States weigh a showdown with the American border authorities; William La Jeunesse reports from Tijuana, Mexico. Despite the announcement, about 50 people walked across a bridge and approached the port facility, but were not immediately accommodated by U.S. officials. They were being permitted to wait in passageways until room became available, and appeared prepared to wait overnight, according to Irineo Mujica, one of the organizers of Pueblos Sin Fronteras, an organization assisting the asylum speakers. Another 50 prepared to camp outside a gate on the Mexican side of the border crossing with backpacks and blankets hoping to get their turn on Monday. Immigration officials had warned that the San Ysidro border crossing may not be able hold many asylum-seekers if it faces too many at once. The port of entry, according to the agency, can hold about 300 people temporarily. Roughly 200 people, including women and young children, were expected to turn themselves over to border inspectors after arriving in Tijuana last week, claiming they had a credible fear of persecution at home. Demonstrators gathered along the border to hold a rally in the hours before crossing over, with some people scaling the fence. ""The only thing I would tell Mr. Trump is to have a conscious and to look at all the people and the way they suffer.

""They face danger and extortions and they are looking for a better life."" The Border Patrol said Saturday that several groups of families from the caravan earlier tried to enter the U.S. illegally by scaling parts of the ""dilapidated scrap metal border fence"" near San Ysidro. 
""In several of these incidents, children as young as 4 years old, and in one case a pregnant female, were detected entering the United States illegally through a dark, treacherous canyon that is notorious for human and drug smuggling,"" U.S. Customs and Border Protection San Diego Chief Patrol Agent Rodney Scott said. ""As a father myself, I find it unconscionable that anyone would expose a child to these dangerous conditions."" The Trump administration has been tracking the caravan since it started March 25 near the Guatemala border, calling it a threat to the U.S., in addition to promising a swift response. The administration has also claimed the caravan represented a deliberate attempt to overwhelm the U.S. legal system and the courts. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said last week that asylum claims would be resolved ""efficiently and expeditiously,"" but that the asylum-seekers should seek it in the first safe country they reach, including Mexico. Caravan of migrants expected to attempt to cross into U.S. this weekend. Asylum-seekers typically are separated from their children and held up to three days at the border before being turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If they pass an asylum officer's initial screening, they may be detained for several months until their court hearing or released with ankle monitors. Nearly 80 percent of asylum-seekers passed the initial screening from October through December, according to the latest numbers available, but few are likely to eventually win asylum. Any asylum seekers making false claims to U.S. authorities could be prosecuted, as could anyone who assists or coaches immigrants on making false claims, according to Nielsen. Administration officials and their allies claim asylum fraud is growing and that many who seek it are coached on how to do so. U.S. immigration lawyers who went to Tijuana have denied coaching people in the caravan, but have said they have been providing one-on-one counseling to assess the merits of their cases and how asylum works in the U.S. ""Like how to defend myself with immigration, how to carry myself,"" a 16-year-old unaccompanied minor from Honduras told OutletName on Saturday regarding the meetings he's had with lawyers. Heather Crone, of U.S. advocacy group Show Up for Racial Justice, said Sundays he's found 80 people in America who have agreed to sponsor caravan members if they're released while their petitions are pending.

NYTimes,"Protesters marched into Lafayette Square opposite the White House on Saturday and chanted “families belong together” to counter President Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy, and were joined in declaring that message by dozens of other rallies from New York to California. While the occupant of the White House was away for the weekend at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club, images of the rallies were broadcast by cable news networks throughout the day. Animated by what they view as the cruel treatment of migrants seeking refuge in the United States from violence in their home countries, the crowds turned out Saturday bearing homemade signs that read “Abolish ICE” — the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency — and “Zero tolerance for family separation.” For two sisters, Claudia Thomas and Monica Escobar, the sight of immigrant children being taken from their parents hit close to home. When they were young, they immigrated to the United States from Guatemala, one of several Central American countries that is a source of migrants today. They said they were out at Saturday’s protest in the nation’s capital to stand up for “human decency.” “No human being should be going through what they’re going through,” Ms. Escobar said. “God bless those families.” While Washington was the political epicenter of the protests, similar scenes unfolded in cities around the country, including large, border cities like El Paso, state capitals like Salt Lake City and Atlanta, and smaller, interior towns like Redding, Calif. In total, organizers anticipated more than 700 protests, in all 50 states and even internationally. The protests were largely peaceful, though there were a few arrests. In Huntsville, Ala., police said one man was arrested after he got into a scuffle with protesters and pulled out a handgun; no one was injured. In Columbus, Ohio, one person was arrested on a charge of obstructing official business, police said. And the Dallas Police Department said five people were arrested during a protest outside of an ICE building. Otherwise, the protests caused few disturbances as demonstrators descended on statehouses and Immigration and Customs Enforcement buildings, and gathered in plazas and in parks, where they danced, chanted and sang. Many clutched signs in one hand with messages berating Mr. Trump and his immigration policies. And, given the summer heat, many clutched water bottles in the other hand, as they sweltered under temperatures that across much of the United States crept into the 90s. In Chicago, all police stations, fire departments and hospitals opened as cooling stations, and in Washington fire trucks misted attendees with water, to cheers. Celebrities like Kerry Washington, star of the hit OutletName series “Scandal,” and the comedian Amy Schumer joined the protests in New York, and politicians like Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, joined the demonstration in Boston. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of “Hamilton,” and Alicia Keys, the singer, songwriter and pianist, performed in Washington. Mr. Trump signed an executive order on June 20 meant to quell outrage over the separation of families by housing parents and children together, for an indefinite period, in ad hoc detention centers. The order explicitly states that the authorities will continue to criminally prosecute adults who cross the border illegally. Many of the more than 2,300 children separated from their migrant parents remain at makeshift shelters and foster homes. Although a federal judge in San Diego issued an order on Tuesday calling for the reunification of families separated at the border within 30 days, White House officials have said that following the ordered timetable would be difficult. The Washington rally was in many ways a festive affair, a moment of unification under a scorching sun. One protester arrived dressed as Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg; another wore a shirt saying “It’s Mueller time,” a reference to the special counsel leading the inquiry into Russian meddling in the election. Adam Unger, a local software engineer, wore a five-gallon bucket turned into a drum, with a felt covering depicting an American flag with the insignia of the Rebel Alliance from “Star Wars” replacing the stars. “This drum has gotten its use over the last year and a half,” Mr. Unger said. He first used it to protest Mr. Trump’s travel ban on people from several predominantly Muslim countries when it was announced in January 2017. Some showed up because they said they were angry; others, because they said they had not been angrier sooner. Maggie Mason, a new mother, said that for two weeks she could not go on Facebook because of news stories about children in detention centers, such as the audio published by ProPublica of immigrant children crying after being separated from their parents. Now, with her 7-week-old baby sleeping in the stroller next to her, she said it was time to come out. Over the past month, marches across the country have cropped up, adding to the pressure on the Trump administration to yield to calls to end the practice of splitting up or detaining families. “The idea of kids in cages and asylum seekers in prisons and moms being separated from breast-feeding children, this is just beyond politics, it really is just about right and wrong,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington State. On Thursday, she was arrested with more than 500 other women who occupied a Senate office building as part of a Women’s March protest against Mr. Trump’s immigration policy. Ms. Jayapal said she has visited a federal prison just south of Seattle and met with 174 women and several dozen men who had been transferred from the Texas border. She said she was moved by the stories of asylum seekers and parents — stories of family members killed, of children left behind, of violent physical attacks and domestic abuse. “I promised them that I would get their stories out and I promised them I would do everything I could to reunite their families,” Ms. Jayapal said. In New York, protesters overflowed Foley Square in Lower Manhattan and filled the surrounding sidewalks. At every intersection on the way to the central march location, clusters of people chanted, “When children are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!” Crowds also inched across the Brooklyn Bridge, a little more than a mile long, for more than two hours. On one side, in Brooklyn, protesters filed into Cadman Plaza, where people stood in the center or sat in the shade, displaying colorful signs and listening to speakers onstage. “We were walking by cars and all the people driving were honking, giving us the peace sign, shaking fists,” said Laura Rittenhouse, who lives in Manhattan and walked across the bridge. “The most important question is what is the process to reunite these families?” she asked. Carmela Huang, from Brooklyn, brought her two young children to the march. Both children were carrying rectangular cardboard signs they had made this morning that read “REUNITE” in large sharpie letters. Ms. Huang said they had not been to a protest yet in 2018. “But today feels really important,” she said. “I’ve had my head in the sand, just feeling tremendously sad.” She described the march as “reassuring, energizing and rejuvenating.” Some protesters carried rainbow umbrellas and blew bubbles, while a trombone player accented chants of activists. Sadatu Mamah-Trawill, a community organizer with the group African Communities Together, brought her 9-year-old son to the protest. A Muslim woman, Ms. Mamah-Trawill said she still had family in Ghana, her place of birth, and could not imagine being separated from her children. “I’m hoping our government hears us very clearly,” she said. “This is big. I don’t think anybody should miss it.” A small group of mostly women and children rallied in Marquette, Mich., in one of the few counties in the state that voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Silke-Maria Weineck, a German studies and comparative literature professor at the University of Michigan, dressed her service dog, Meemo, with an “Abolish ICE” sign for the occasion. “It’s certainly a conservative part of the country,” she added, “but people feel very strongly about their children.” Outside the Bedminster country club where Mr. Trump was spending the weekend, a few protesters could be seen. “My civility is locked in a cage,” said one sign. “Reunite families now.”","protesters marched into lafayette square opposite the white house on saturday and chanted “ families belong together ” to counter president trump ’ s “ zero tolerance ” immigration policy, and were joined in declaring that message by dozens of other rallies from new york to california. while the occupant of the white house was away for the weekend at his bedminster, n. j., golf club, images of the rallies were broadcast by cable news networks throughout the day. animated by what they view as the cruel treatment of migrants seeking refuge in the united states from violence in their home countries, the crowds turned out saturday bearing homemade signs that read “ abolish ice ” — the immigration and customs enforcement agency — and “ zero tolerance for family separation. ” for two sisters, claudia thomas and monica escobar, the sight of immigrant children being taken from their parents hit close to home. when they were young, they immigrated to the united states from guatemala, one of several central american countries that is a source of migrants today. they said they were out at saturday ’ s protest in the nation ’ s capital to stand up for “ human decency. ” “ no human being should be going through what they ’ re going through, ” ms. escobar said. “ god bless those families. ” while washington was the political epicenter of the protests, similar scenes unfolded in cities around the country, including large, border cities like el paso, state capitals like salt lake city and atlanta, and smaller, interior towns like redding, calif. in total, organizers anticipated more than 700 protests, in all 50 states and even internationally. the protests were largely peaceful, though there were a few arrests. in huntsville, ala., police said one man was arrested after he got into a scuffle with protesters and pulled out a handgun ; no one was injured. in columbus, ohio, one person was arrested on a charge of obstructing official business, police said. and the dallas police department said five people were arrested during a protest outside of an ice building. otherwise, the protests caused few disturbances as demonstrators descended on statehouses and immigration and customs enforcement buildings, and gathered in plazas and in parks, where they danced, chanted and sang. many clutched signs in one hand with messages berating mr. trump and his immigration policies. and, given the summer heat, many clutched water bottles in the other hand, as they sweltered under temperatures that across much of the united states crept into the 90s. in chicago, all",0.999984860420227,0.499984861659868,1,409,2.93,5.87,4.65,2.2,0.0,2.44,2.93,0.0,0.49,0.24,0.24,0.0,1.96,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.49,0.0,13.69,1.22,0.0,0.49,1.22,1.22,1.22,0.98,0.24,0.73,0.98,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.67,1.96,11.0,1.22,0.24,0.24,3.42,7.09,0.49,0.73,5.623471882640587,9.7799511002445,2.689486552567237
Breitbart,"Border Patrol agents assigned to the Laredo Sector rescued 22 illegal immigrants who were locked in the back of a box truck. The agents made the discovery at a Border Patrol checkpoint located between Laredo and San Antonio on Interstate Highway 35.
Agents assigned to the checkpoint observed a box truck approaching the inspection station. The agents became suspicious after questioning the driver and referred him to the secondary inspection station. During the inspection, agents discovered 22 illegal immigrants locked in the back of the truck, according to information obtained by OutletName Texas from U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.
In many cases like this, the migrants are found to be overheated and dehydrated. These migrants were lucky. All appeared to be in good health, officials stated. The 22 illegal immigrants came to the U.S. via cartel-connected human smugglers. They arrived from Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala.
“These criminal organizations view these individuals as mere commodities without regard for their safety,” Laredo Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Gabriel Acosta said in a written statement. “The blatant disregard for human life will not be tolerated. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to disrupt and dismantle these organizations and prosecute those responsible.”
Authorities identified the driver of the vehicle as a U.S. citizen. They did not release his name. The driver will likely be prosecuted for human smuggling.
Crossing into the United States illegally can be very dangerous, officials stated. “Our Border Safety Initiative (BSI) is a humanitarian, bi-national strategy designed to reduce illegal alien deaths, educate and inform potential illegal aliens of the dangers and hazards of crossing the border illegally, and to respond to those who are in life-threatening situations,” the statement concluded.
On February 22, OutletName Texas reported that Border Patrol agents and local sheriff’s deputies recovered the skeletal remains of four illegal immigrants who attempted to circumvent Border Patrol checkpoints in Falfurrias and Sarita, Texas.
“It is hard to determine how long these people lay in the fields after they died,” Brooks County Sheriff Benny Martinez told OutletName Texas. “Between the harsh climate, animals, and insects, a body decomposes to skeletal remains very quickly down here. The medical examiner should be able to help with establishing a better time of death.”
“These smugglers have no regard for human life,” the sheriff continued. “When a person gets sick, injured, dehydrated, or otherwise can’t keep up with the pack, the smugglers simply leave them behind to die.”","border patrol agents assigned to the laredo sector rescued 22 illegal immigrants who were locked in the back of a box truck. the agents made the discovery at a border patrol checkpoint located between laredo and san antonio on interstate highway 35. agents assigned to the checkpoint observed a box truck approaching the inspection station. the agents became suspicious after questioning the driver and referred him to the secondary inspection station. during the inspection, agents discovered 22 illegal immigrants locked in the back of the truck, according to information obtained by outletname texas from u. s. customs and border protection officials. in many cases like this, the migrants are found to be overheated and dehydrated. these migrants were lucky. all appeared to be in good health, officials stated. the 22 illegal immigrants came to the u. s. via cartel - connected human smugglers. they arrived from mexico, el salvador, and guatemala. “ these criminal organizations view these individuals as mere commodities without regard for their safety, ” laredo sector assistant chief patrol agent gabriel acosta said in a written statement. “ the blatant disregard for human life will not be tolerated. we will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to disrupt and dismantle these organizations and prosecute those responsible. ” authorities identified the driver of the vehicle as a u. s. citizen. they did not release his name. the driver will likely be prosecuted for human smuggling. crossing into the united states illegally can be very dangerous, officials stated. “ our border safety initiative ( bsi ) is a humanitarian, bi - national strategy designed to reduce illegal alien deaths, educate and inform potential illegal aliens of the dangers and hazards of crossing the border illegally, and to respond to those who are in life - threatening situations, ” the statement concluded. on february 22, outletname texas reported that border patrol agents and local sheriff ’ s deputies recovered the skeletal remains of four illegal immigrants who attempted to circumvent border patrol checkpoints in falfurrias and sarita, texas. “ it is hard to determine how long these people lay in the fields after they died, ” brooks county sheriff benny martinez told outletname texas. “ between the harsh climate, animals, and insects, a body decomposes to skeletal remains very quickly down here. the medical examiner should be able to help with establishing a better time of death. ” “ these smugglers have no regard for human life, ” the sheriff continued. “ when a person gets sick, injured, dehydrated, or otherwise can ’",1.80861625267e-05,0.499981880187988,0,405,1.48,0.99,6.67,1.23,1.23,4.2,7.65,3.7,0.99,0.74,0.99,0.0,1.23,0.25,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.0,4.2,0.0,0.0,2.96,1.23,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.74,0.0,1.98,11.6,2.22,7.65,0.74,0.0,0.25,2.22,5.19,1.73,1.23,7.901234567901234,6.172839506172839,1.2345679012345678
FoxNews,"Since getting back from Christmas break, I've tortured myself by reading and watching some of the usual suspects in the media - Fake news populated by fake thinkers.
Now there are basically two movements in the coverage. First, the manufactured outrage about what is a partial, and obviously temporary, government shutdown. Government workers haven't missed a paycheck yet. I hope they don't.
The second in this coverage is the downplayed concern about the actual effect that illegal immigration has in America, because in the media's way of thinking, it's not a crisis at all.
OK. I am completely confused. It's a crisis that certain nonessential government workers won't be paid starting on Friday - though they will ultimately get all their money when the government reopens. But it's not a crisis when just in the past fiscal year, a total of almost 400,000 individuals were caught crossing our southwest border?
Now, to give you a sense of just how bad it is, in October and November of this past year, that's the first two months of the new fiscal year, almost 102,000 people have been caught. That's quite a clip.
And the number of people crossing illegally with children has also skyrocketed. In the Rio Grande Valley sector alone, the number spiked 27 percent since last year, jumping from like 49,896 in fiscal year 2017 to 63,278 in the last fiscal year. Not a crisis?
This is, and has been, a crisis felt by average Americans far beyond the comfy confines of TV studios and far beyond the heady halls of Congress. Yet the media and deceitful politicians only acknowledge the crisis when the tragedy of an immigrant child makes the headlines.
And you bet every life is precious. And you bet that every death is tragic - deaths at the border, deaths beyond the border. But the fault here lies with irresponsible parents who expose their children to this perilous journey and the feckless politicians who refused to do their job and support a common sense enforcement agenda that President Trump has and asylum reform that is beyond desperately needed.
Now, over the past year, I have repeatedly urged the president to address this critical issue, and not just the wall, in a major primetime address. Well, I'm glad to see that he announced he's doing just that on Tuesday night. And it's going to be followed by a trip to the actual border in McAllen, Texas. Good.
I would hope that when he does this, the president personalizes the border crisis. Those statistics I just gave you are important. But we need to emphasize how illegal immigration has directly - and at times, tragically - affected the lives of all Americans and the people trying to come into the country. It's been dangerous for them.
Tuesday's speech should be wide-ranging, hitting all the big immigration issues, from chain migration to the visa lottery, the need for mandatory e-verify in the workplace, and also yes, even the scam of so-called birthright citizenship. That's where children of non-U.S. citizens are granted automatic citizenship, just for being born here.
Every year, thousands of Chinese, Russians, and others travel to the United States to have babies just for the U.S. passport. It's called birth tourism. It is a complete outrage. It's big business. And no, it's not a constitutional right. So don't try me on that.
As for all those who claim, by the way, that illegal immigration is not a crisis, I think American families of these victims would disagree. The day after Christmas, California officer Ronil Singh was shot in cold blood during a routine traffic stop. He left behind a wife and a five-month-old baby. His murderer is illegal alien Gustavo Perez Arriaga.
Thousands of citizens and hundreds of officers attended the funeral service over the weekend. I wish all of you could watch it.Officer Singh originally hailed from Fiji. Naivakarurubalavu Solo Mara, the Fijian ambassador to the U.S., spoke at the service and he had a better grasp of this tragedy than many American commentators.
""No words can take away their pains. No object can fill the void in their hearts,"" he said. ""No embrace can be more comforting. No scheme can replace their shattered dreams. No death can be more untimely. This is what Ronil Singh's passing must mean to those closest to him.""
And Officer Singh's parents are still alive as well, by the way.
And then on December 29th, 22-year-old Pierce Corcoran was killed in a collision in Knoxville, Tenn. The man who swerved into him and took his life was another illegal alien, Franco Cambrany Francisco-Eduardo.
My friends, the families of both of these upstanding Americans are in crisis. The president cannot relent. He must continue to speak for these families and frankly for the millions of you who believe that every country -- not just our country but every country around the world -- has the sovereign right to determine who can and cannot reside here. It's not immoral to do so.
And if our elected representatives refuse to do their solemn duty to defend our country, then we, in essence, kind of already have a government that is shut down -- shut down to the will of the people. And by the way, the people routinely rank illegal immigration as one of the most urgent problems facing this nation.
As for the Republicans on Capitol Hill, think about it for a moment. Take a lesson from the Democrats. They never break ranks. Think about what you Republicans accomplished by supporting the president during the confirmation fight of Brett Kavanaugh.

Adapted from Laura Ingraham's monologue from ""The Ingraham Angle"" on January 7, 2019.","since getting back from christmas break, i've tortured myself by reading and watching some of the usual suspects in the media - fake news populated by fake thinkers. now there are basically two movements in the coverage. first, the manufactured outrage about what is a partial, and obviously temporary, government shutdown. government workers haven't missed a paycheck yet. i hope they don't. the second in this coverage is the downplayed concern about the actual effect that illegal immigration has in america, because in the media's way of thinking, it's not a crisis at all. ok. i am completely confused. it's a crisis that certain nonessential government workers won't be paid starting on friday - though they will ultimately get all their money when the government reopens. but it's not a crisis when just in the past fiscal year, a total of almost 400, 000 individuals were caught crossing our southwest border? now, to give you a sense of just how bad it is, in october and november of this past year, that's the first two months of the new fiscal year, almost 102, 000 people have been caught. that's quite a clip. and the number of people crossing illegally with children has also skyrocketed. in the rio grande valley sector alone, the number spiked 27 percent since last year, jumping from like 49, 896 in fiscal year 2017 to 63, 278 in the last fiscal year. not a crisis? this is, and has been, a crisis felt by average americans far beyond the comfy confines of tv studios and far beyond the heady halls of congress. yet the media and deceitful politicians only acknowledge the crisis when the tragedy of an immigrant child makes the headlines. and you bet every life is precious. and you bet that every death is tragic - deaths at the border, deaths beyond the border. but the fault here lies with irresponsible parents who expose their children to this perilous journey and the feckless politicians who refused to do their job and support a common sense enforcement agenda that president trump has and asylum reform that is beyond desperately needed. now, over the past year, i have repeatedly urged the president to address this critical issue, and not just the wall, in a major primetime address. well, i'm glad to see that he announced he's doing just that on tuesday night. and it's going to be followed by a trip to the actual border in mcallen,",0.994556427001953,0.494556409772485,0,408,3.68,5.64,3.43,0.49,0.25,2.7,8.09,1.96,1.72,0.98,2.21,0.49,1.96,0.49,1.72,0.0,0.25,0.49,9.56,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.25,0.0,1.96,2.21,0.25,0.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.74,0.0,1.72,9.8,1.23,7.35,0.49,0.0,0.74,8.58,3.68,6.62,1.23,4.038004750593824,12.589073634204276,1.4251781472684086
CNN,"President-elect Donald Trump completed a deposition Thursday over his legal battle against chef José Andrés, Trump transition team spokeswoman Hope Hicks told OutletName.
Trump sued Andres for breach of contract after the chef backed out of a plan for a restaurant in Trump's new luxury hotel in Washington. Andres claimed he canceled plans for the project after Trump made disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants during his presidential campaign.
Trump's attorneys previously agreed to his deposition in New York, but sought to limit the length and scope of questioning, arguing in court filings that ""Mr. Trump is not just any apex deponent; he is the President-elect ... It is not an overstatement that he is extremely busy handling matters of very significant public importance.""
But DC Superior Court Judge Jennifer A. Di Toro ruled in December that limiting Trump's examination would be too prejudicial to the defense team's right to prepare the case for trial, and ""Mr. Trump's own statements are at the heart"" of the parties' claims.

Daily Caller,"A Spanish language reporter who has spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan said in a Friday report that people from Bangladesh had joined the mass of people trying to cross from Guatemala into Mexico.
Univision correspondent Francisco Santa Anna reported from the bridge separating Guatemala and Mexico. The bridge has been packed with thousands of migrants demanding access to Mexico, with the ultimate goal of crossing the border of the United States illegally. The caravan has now swelled to many thousands.
The Bangladeshis, he said, were detained in an immigration facility, though it’s not clear what happened to them after their detention.
“The borders in Central American are not as strong as the U.S., which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily,” Santa Anna said on Univision. “They cross from Costa Rica, then later go through Guatemala and eventually make it into our country.”
“Yesterday when we were traveling through Guatemala, we noticed people from El Salvador and even people from Bangladesh,” he continued. “Can you imagine what they had to do to get here? They infiltrated themselves in this caravan and tried to cross with the crowd. That would have benefited them greatly.”
Bangladesh has one of the largest populations of Muslims in the world. Its 141 million Muslims is more than the combined populations of Iran, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, Georgetown University professor C. Christine Fair noted in an essay in Lawfare.
The country is “increasingly the site of Islamist violence,” Fair wrote.
According to the essay “Political Islam and Islamist Terrorism in Bangladesh: What You Need to Know”:
Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) and the Islamic State (IS) have increased their activity in Bangladesh in recent years. IS has taken responsibility for attacks on foreigners, homosexuals, Shia, Ahmadis, Sufis, and other religious minorities, among other groups. Islamist militants have targeted secular writers and bloggers in particular, with an online “hit list.” Dozens of Bangladeshis, including persons of Bangladeshi extraction in the United Kingdom, have gone to fight with the Islamic State, and in April 2016, the organization’s English-language magazine, Dabiq, offered a tribute to a Bangladeshi militant who died in Syria.
The country of Bangladesh borders India and is many thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean from the caravan’s departure point.","a spanish language reporter who has spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan said in a friday report that people from bangladesh had joined the mass of people trying to cross from guatemala into mexico. univision correspondent francisco santa anna reported from the bridge separating guatemala and mexico. the bridge has been packed with thousands of migrants demanding access to mexico, with the ultimate goal of crossing the border of the united states illegally. the caravan has now swelled to many thousands. the bangladeshis, he said, were detained in an immigration facility, though it ’ s not clear what happened to them after their detention. “ the borders in central american are not as strong as the u. s., which makes it possible for people from panama and ecuador to cross easily, ” santa anna said on univision. “ they cross from costa rica, then later go through guatemala and eventually make it into our country. ” “ yesterday when we were traveling through guatemala, we noticed people from el salvador and even people from bangladesh, ” he continued. “ can you imagine what they had to do to get here? they infiltrated themselves in this caravan and tried to cross with the crowd. that would have benefited them greatly. ” bangladesh has one of the largest populations of muslims in the world. its 141 million muslims is more than the combined populations of iran, afghanistan and saudi arabia, georgetown university professor c. christine fair noted in an essay in lawfare. the country is “ increasingly the site of islamist violence, ” fair wrote. according to the essay “ political islam and islamist terrorism in bangladesh : what you need to know ” : al - qaeda in the indian subcontinent ( aqis ) and the islamic state ( is ) have increased their activity in bangladesh in recent years. is has taken responsibility for attacks on foreigners, homosexuals, shia, ahmadis, sufis, and other religious minorities, among other groups. islamist militants have targeted secular writers and bloggers in particular, with an online “ hit list. ” dozens of bangladeshis, including persons of bangladeshi extraction in the united kingdom, have gone to fight with the islamic state, and in april 2016, the organization ’ s english - language magazine, dabiq, offered a tribute to a bangladeshi militant who died in syria. the country of bangladesh borders india and is many thousands of miles across the pacific ocean from the caravan ’ s departure point.",2.50099892582e-05,0.499974966049194,0,388,2.06,4.12,4.9,1.29,0.77,2.84,5.15,0.77,0.77,1.03,0.26,0.0,2.32,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.34,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.77,0.0,0.0,2.06,0.26,2.58,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.26,0.0,0.26,0.52,0.0,10.57,2.32,8.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.35,5.15,3.61,0.26,4.123711340206185,11.34020618556701,1.0309278350515463
FoxNews,"President Trump backed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Tuesday in the face of growing Democratic calls to abolish the agency -- a day after the White House had targeted individual lawmakers for their attacks.
“When we have an “infestation” of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE!” Trump tweeted. “They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments [sic] that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov.”
The tweet comes in response to growing calls from Democratic lawmakers and candidates to abolish the agency known as ICE in the wake of the Trump administration’s tougher stance on border security and enforcement of immigration laws.
In particular, the controversy surrounding the Department of Justice’s “zero tolerance” policy on prosecuting all illegal border crossers has brought a number of Democratic lawmakers on board with what was once a fringe position.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., both rumored to be in the running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, have called for the abolition of ICE, while Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has said the U.S. should consider “starting from scratch” in overhauling the agency.
The calls come after far-left primary challenger and ICE opponent Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shocked the party’s establishment last week by beating Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y.
On Monday, the White House targeted Harris and Warren individually on Twitter, accusing Harris of “supporting the animals of MS-13.'
“You must not know what ICE really does,” the tweets read.
Trump has repeatedly connected criticism of border and immigration enforcement with a softness or even support of MS-13 -- the gang started by Central American immigrants in the 1980s and known for its particularly brutal crimes and motto: “Kill, rape, control.”
“[Democrats] want them taken care of. They want them to be left alone,” Trump said last month.
On Tuesday, he indicated that he believed that the “abolish ICE” stance would hurt Democrats in future elections.
“How can the Democrats, who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime, do well in November,” he said. “The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security, while the Democrats are more interested in ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great Law Enforcement!”","president trump backed immigration and customs enforcement agents on tuesday in the face of growing democratic calls to abolish the agency - - a day after the white house had targeted individual lawmakers for their attacks. “ when we have an “ infestation ” of ms - 13 gangs in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ice! ” trump tweeted. “ they are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments [ sic ] that bad immigration laws allow into our country. dems don't appreciate the great job they do! nov. ” the tweet comes in response to growing calls from democratic lawmakers and candidates to abolish the agency known as ice in the wake of the trump administration ’ s tougher stance on border security and enforcement of immigration laws. in particular, the controversy surrounding the department of justice ’ s “ zero tolerance ” policy on prosecuting all illegal border crossers has brought a number of democratic lawmakers on board with what was once a fringe position. sens. elizabeth warren, d - mass., and kirsten gillibrand, d - n. y., both rumored to be in the running for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination, have called for the abolition of ice, while sen. kamala harris, d - calif., has said the u. s. should consider “ starting from scratch ” in overhauling the agency. the calls come after far - left primary challenger and ice opponent alexandria ocasio - cortez shocked the party ’ s establishment last week by beating rep. joseph crowley, d - n. y. on monday, the white house targeted harris and warren individually on twitter, accusing harris of “ supporting the animals of ms - 13.'“ you must not know what ice really does, ” the tweets read. trump has repeatedly connected criticism of border and immigration enforcement with a softness or even support of ms - 13 - - the gang started by central american immigrants in the 1980s and known for its particularly brutal crimes and motto : “ kill, rape, control. ” “ [ democrats ] want them taken care of. they want them to be left alone, ” trump said last month. on tuesday, he indicated that he believed that the “ abolish ice ” stance would hurt democrats in future elections. “ how can the democrats, who are weak on the border and weak on crime, do well in november, ” he said. “ the people of our country want and demand safety and security,",0.0006149438559077,0.499384999275207,0,380,1.84,2.37,8.68,2.11,0.26,6.32,6.32,1.84,1.05,1.84,0.26,0.26,1.32,0.26,0.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.26,0.0,0.0,0.79,0.79,0.26,0.53,1.84,0.0,0.0,1.84,0.53,0.0,0.26,0.0,0.26,0.0,0.79,10.26,1.05,8.16,0.53,0.0,0.79,4.74,3.68,2.63,0.26,6.824146981627297,11.811023622047244,3.149606299212598
HuffPost,"Much of the public debate around immigration in the U.S. and its costs and benefits centers on economic effects like job competition and added stress to public programs and benefits. One significant factor that gets missed by all the rhetoric is the role of the immigrant entrepreneur.
Immigrants and children of immigrants are the quintessential American entrepreneurs. They work hard to get here, and then they keep working after they arrive. They’re nearly twice as likely to start a business as their native-born counterparts! According to research by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, a whole 25% of all engineering and tech companies in the U.S. founded between 2006 and 2012 had at least one founder who was an immigrant. And not only have immigrants consistently been more entrepreneurial than native-born citizens, but in recent years that gap has been gradually growing.
These immigrant entrepreneurs have to be included in any serious reckoning of immigration and its costs and benefits. But regardless of their effect on the economy as a whole, we can look to these innovators as role models to study. What makes immigrants so likely to start their own businesses, and what can we learn from them?
Determined to Succeed
Entrepreneur Magazine says that of the companies in the U.S. Fortune 500, upwards of 40% were founded by first- or second-generation immigrants, even though immigrants only make up 13.5% of the total population. So what sets this population apart? What gives them the push to innovate and take risks where native-born Americans don’t?
One obvious distinction that sets the immigrant population apart is the simple fact of having gone through the immigration process. It takes determination and resilience to get through the process successfully, to be undeterred by setbacks and to keep trying and seeking out viable pathways to immigrate. For people to make it through the challenging, complex and ambiguous immigration system, they have to bring those qualities with them or pick them up on the way. And then they have to be able to deal with being an outsider once they arrive. And no matter how bad conditions are in your home country, it takes courage and a willingness to take on significant risks to get up and leave.
That determination and resilience serve them well in bringing them here and helping them adjust to their new environment, and it continues to serve many of them well as they go about making a living and starting their own businesses. And that’s one way we can emulate immigrant entrepreneurs. Even though native-born citizens haven’t had to go through the process, they can still learn to persevere and take hope from studying the determination that immigrant entrepreneurs bring with them.
Imagining Your Endgame
“To build a business from the ground up, you’ve got to be committed. You need to really want it,” says Steve Lewis, president of Ambient Edge. “It takes a big sense of imagination, too. You’ll never have the courage to lay those first bricks unless you’ve already got a blueprint you believe in.”
That sense of imagination is something we can learn from immigrants as well. For those who put in the work and are able to find a path to come to the U.S., it’s not something done on a whim. It’s a massive undertaking done for a reason. And that reason for many is the American Dream.
The American Dream is the imagined independence, stability and opportunity that, for many outside of the U.S., are simply not possible in their country of origin, whether that’s because of entrenched inequality or simply the lack of the safe, stable economic conditions you need to be able to start a business.
For many native-born Americans, we take those things for granted. By learning from the experiences of immigrant entrepreneurs, however, we can recognize the opportunities around us and allow ourselves to start dreaming about all the possibilities that come with them.
The Importance of Cross-Cultural Experience
Another factor that may contribute to more entrepreneurial activity among immigrants is the experience immigrants bring with them. Immigrants naturally have more experience in cross-cultural situations than many native-born Americans, and this means they’ve been exposed to more different perspectives, to more varied ways of doing business. That exposure can lead to more creative ideas, to thinking beyond the way it’s normally done. Having experienced different markets in different countries, and coming from a more marginal community in the U.S., immigrants can also find niche markets whose demands are not being met or identify products and practices from outside the U.S. that could also be successful here.","much of the public debate around immigration in the u. s. and its costs and benefits centers on economic effects like job competition and added stress to public programs and benefits. one significant factor that gets missed by all the rhetoric is the role of the immigrant entrepreneur. immigrants and children of immigrants are the quintessential american entrepreneurs. they work hard to get here, and then they keep working after they arrive. they ’ re nearly twice as likely to start a business as their native - born counterparts! according to research by the ewing marion kauffman foundation, a whole 25 % of all engineering and tech companies in the u. s. founded between 2006 and 2012 had at least one founder who was an immigrant. and not only have immigrants consistently been more entrepreneurial than native - born citizens, but in recent years that gap has been gradually growing. these immigrant entrepreneurs have to be included in any serious reckoning of immigration and its costs and benefits. but regardless of their effect on the economy as a whole, we can look to these innovators as role models to study. what makes immigrants so likely to start their own businesses, and what can we learn from them? determined to succeed entrepreneur magazine says that of the companies in the u. s. fortune 500, upwards of 40 % were founded by first - or second - generation immigrants, even though immigrants only make up 13. 5 % of the total population. so what sets this population apart? what gives them the push to innovate and take risks where native - born americans don ’ t? one obvious distinction that sets the immigrant population apart is the simple fact of having gone through the immigration process. it takes determination and resilience to get through the process successfully, to be undeterred by setbacks and to keep trying and seeking out viable pathways to immigrate. for people to make it through the challenging, complex and ambiguous immigration system, they have to bring those qualities with them or pick them up on the way. and then they have to be able to deal with being an outsider once they arrive. and no matter how bad conditions are in your home country, it takes courage and a willingness to take on significant risks to get up and leave. that determination and resilience serve them well in bringing them here and helping them adjust to their new environment, and it continues to serve many of them well as they go about making a living and starting their own businesses. and that ’ s one way we can emulate immigrant entrepreneurs. even though native - born citizens",0.999932885169982,0.499932943806925,1,437,3.43,4.81,4.81,0.92,2.97,1.37,9.38,1.6,2.06,0.92,1.6,0.23,3.2,0.23,0.46,0.23,0.0,0.0,12.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.23,4.58,1.83,0.0,0.23,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.37,0.46,9.38,2.29,6.86,0.23,0.0,0.23,3.66,3.43,3.43,1.37,5.949656750572083,12.128146453089245,1.1441647597254003
HuffPost,"Associated Press Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) issued an executive order on Monday withdrawing 112 soldiers and airmen of the Wisconsin National Guard from the U.S.-Mexico border.
Citing “no justification” for stationing National Guard troops at the U.S.-Mexico border, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) issued an executive order Monday withdrawing more than 110 soldiers and airmen of the Wisconsin National Guard from Arizona’s southern border.
“There is simply not ample evidence to support the president’s contention that there exists a national security crisis at our southwestern border,” Evers said in a statement, referring to President Donald Trump’s claim that the U.S. is facing an immigration emergency:
There is simply not ample evidence to support the president’s contention of a national security crisis at our southwestern border. Therefore, there is no justification for the ongoing presence of Wisconsin National Guard personnel at the border. ://t.co/ggPNa10zWW — Governor Tony Evers () February 25, 2019
Evers’ predecessor, Republican Gov. Scott Walker, deployed the state’s National Guard to Arizona last June following a proclamation signed by Trump ordering the National Guard to protect the border. In his executive order this week, Evers said that he revoked consent for this deployment and called for all 112 Wisconsin National Guard to be “promptly” pulled off their current missions at the border.
Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin were quick to lambaste Evers’ decision. Sen. Ron Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, called the governor’s move “unfortunate.” Scott Fitzgerald, the majority leader of the state Senate, accused Evers of “playing politics instead of working to keep Wisconsin safe.”
GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who said he serves in the Wisconsin National Guard, also took issue with Evers’ announcement.
“I’m grateful to my fellow Wisconsin Guard members, and I’m deeply disappointed you won’t let them do what they are trained to do for the good of the country. [Gov. Evers] I hope you’ll reconsider,” Kinzinger wrote.
His crew found and directed  to a man crossing the border with 70 lbs of meth. Had we not been there, that deadly drug would be on the streets. Wonder the damage that would do in Milwaukee... — Adam Kinzinger () February 25, 2019
Evers is the third governor this month to pull National Guard troops from the border. The first was New Mexico’s Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat who declared that her state would “not take part in the president’s charade of border fear-mongering.” California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) soon followed suit, announcing his intention on Feb. 11 to pull most of the state’s 360 National Guard troops from the border.
“The border ‘emergency’ is a manufactured crisis, and California will not be part of this political theater,” Newsom said.
Days later, Trump — in an effort to fund his much-touted border wall — declared a national emergency at the southern border.","associated press wisconsin gov. tony evers ( d ) issued an executive order on monday withdrawing 112 soldiers and airmen of the wisconsin national guard from the u. s. - mexico border. citing “ no justification ” for stationing national guard troops at the u. s. - mexico border, wisconsin gov. tony evers ( d ) issued an executive order monday withdrawing more than 110 soldiers and airmen of the wisconsin national guard from arizona ’ s southern border. “ there is simply not ample evidence to support the president ’ s contention that there exists a national security crisis at our southwestern border, ” evers said in a statement, referring to president donald trump ’ s claim that the u. s. is facing an immigration emergency : there is simply not ample evidence to support the president ’ s contention of a national security crisis at our southwestern border. therefore, there is no justification for the ongoing presence of wisconsin national guard personnel at the border. : / / t. co / ggpna10zww — governor tony evers ( ) february 25, 2019 evers ’ predecessor, republican gov. scott walker, deployed the state ’ s national guard to arizona last june following a proclamation signed by trump ordering the national guard to protect the border. in his executive order this week, evers said that he revoked consent for this deployment and called for all 112 wisconsin national guard to be “ promptly ” pulled off their current missions at the border. republican lawmakers in wisconsin were quick to lambaste evers ’ decision. sen. ron johnson, chairman of the senate homeland security committee, called the governor ’ s move “ unfortunate. ” scott fitzgerald, the majority leader of the state senate, accused evers of “ playing politics instead of working to keep wisconsin safe. ” gop rep. adam kinzinger of illinois, who said he serves in the wisconsin national guard, also took issue with evers ’ announcement. “ i ’ m grateful to my fellow wisconsin guard members, and i ’ m deeply disappointed you won ’ t let them do what they are trained to do for the good of the country.

HuffPost,"Nearly 60 percent of Americans disagree with President Donald Trump’s reported comment about immigration from “shithole countries,” a new OutletName/YouGov survey finds, with most considering the statement to be racist.
Just over half of those polled last Thursday and Friday said they’d heard about the comment. Attention was concentrated among the president’s opponents, with more than 70 percent of Clinton voters, but just over half of Trump voters and less than 40 percent of nonvoters and third-party voters saying they were familiar with the remark.
Just over one-quarter of Americans said they agreed with the comment, while 58 percent said they disagreed. By a roughly 2-to-1 margin, 53 percent to 26 percent, Americans said it was racist to call African countries and Haiti “shithole countries.”
The survey question read, “According to a recent news report, President Trump asked ‘Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?’, referring to immigration from African countries and Haiti.”
The survey began the evening The Washington Post first reported on the remark, at which time the Trump administration had issued a statement that did not deny the president had made the comment. Since then, there’s been extensive back-and-forth from the White House and other meeting attendees about what, exactly, the president said, which remains in dispute.
Trump allies and others familiar with the meeting have argued, at varying times, that the president said nothing of the sort, that he actually said “shithouse,” that he used the word “shithole” to describe African countries but not Haiti, and that Trump did make the “shithole countries” comment as reported, but that the comment was acceptable.
After the story first broke, some White House staffers reportedly predicted the remark would resonate with Trump’s base, much like his earlier attacks on NFL players. But Trump voters, who enthusiastically agreed when he slammed the football protests, were somewhat less supportive of the alleged “shithole countries” remark: Sixty-two percent agreed with the statement, but only about one-third did so strongly, and 23 percent disagreed. Just 11 percent, however, considered it racist.
A near-universal 94 percent of Clinton voters disagreed with the statement, most of them citing strong disagreement, and 92 percent said they considered it racist. A slight majority of nonvoters and third-party voters said they disagreed with the statement, and about the same amount said they believed it was racist.

A broad majority of Americans, regardless of whom they voted for in the last election, still believe that the U.S. is a nation of immigrants, and just over half said that immigration is, on the whole, a good thing for the country. But while 84 percent of Clinton voters said that immigration is, on the whole, a good thing for the country, and just 4 percent said it’s a bad thing, Trump voters said 40 percent to 34 percent that immigration is a bad thing for the U.S. (The rest said it’s neither good nor bad, or that they were unsure.)
A closer look at opinions on different groups of immigrants to the U.S. shows little public concern over an influx of people from some of the countries Trump reportedly maligned, although Trump voters were roughly twice as likely to say Africa sends too many immigrants than to say the same about Europe.
Overall, between 36 and 41 percent polled said immigration has been too high in recent years from “Mexico and Central America,” “predominantly Muslim countries” and “the Middle East.” Under one-quarter of respondents said the same about “China, India and other parts of Asia,” or about African nations, with even fewer respondents saying the U.S. admits too many immigrants from Europe or from “predominantly Christian countries.” (A 2016 poll from PRRI and the Brookings Institution, which asked a similar question, found concerns even more substantially focused on Mexico and Central America.)

HuffPost,"Lawyers from the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services say the Trump administration is violating a legal agreement not to detain immigrant children for more than 20 days.
Children as young as 5 are being illegally detained for up to 60 days in a Texas family detention center, according to a complaint filed by immigration advocates on Wednesday.
Lawyers from the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services say the Trump administration is violating the Flores settlement, a legal agreement that has been interpreted in federal court to mean that immigrant children may not be held in family detention centers for more than 20 days.
The complaint details how a group of four kids, ages 5 to 16, in the Karnes City facility are suffering “horrendous” effects such as depression, loss of appetite and physical illnesses such as chicken pox and chronic coughing.
Family detention is “a cruel and unnecessary practice that needs to end,” says Andrea Meza, the associate director of family detention services at RAICES. “There’s so much evidence that it’s bad for children.”
She says the Karnes family detention center, which is unlicensed and holds men and boys, is not fit for children. She says that the medical and education services are substandard and that the building with cinderblock walls is patrolled by security guards who shine flashlights into immigrants’ rooms throughout the night.
“It’s very much like a prison they put some paint on and hung up some cute kids’ posters in,” she says.
Danielle Bennett, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson, told OutletName that its three family detention centers in the U.S. include “medical care, play rooms, social workers, educational services, and access to legal counsel.”
“ICE takes very seriously the health, safety and welfare of those in our care,” she said in an email to OutletName. “ICE is committed to ensuring the welfare of all those in the agency’s custody, including providing access to necessary and appropriate medical care.”
Meza says ICE is keeping these men and boys unnecessarily detained, since they all have family members in the U.S. they could be released to.
Last year the average detention time in children’s-only shelters ballooned to 59 days ― almost double the average stay during the final year of the Obama administration ― and the RAICES complaint states that prolonged detention is part of a “disturbing recent trend” that violates the civil rights and liberties of immigrant families.
Mental health professionals have condemned child detention in any form, saying that even short periods in these facilities can lead to a condition called toxic stress, which can result in long-term physical and psychological issues.
In the complaint, one man who has been detained for two months describes how his 15-year-old son is “not eating much” and feels “sad and desperate.” Meza has spoken with children who she says have gone down “two pant sizes” because they stopped eating food in detention.
The complaint also describes how a 5-year-old boy who was put in medical isolation because of chicken pox constantly tells his father, “Let’s go dad, let’s get out of here.”
RAICES has demanded that the Department of Homeland Security immediately release the four families in the complaint and review how its practice of detaining parents and children violates the Flores settlement.","lawyers from the refugee and immigrant center for education and legal services say the trump administration is violating a legal agreement not to detain immigrant children for more than 20 days. children as young as 5 are being illegally detained for up to 60 days in a texas family detention center, according to a complaint filed by immigration advocates on wednesday. lawyers from the refugee and immigrant center for education and legal services say the trump administration is violating the flores settlement, a legal agreement that has been interpreted in federal court to mean that immigrant children may not be held in family detention centers for more than 20 days. the complaint details how a group of four kids, ages 5 to 16, in the karnes city facility are suffering “ horrendous ” effects such as depression, loss of appetite and physical illnesses such as chicken pox and chronic coughing. family detention is “ a cruel and unnecessary practice that needs to end, ” says andrea meza, the associate director of family detention services at raices. “ there ’ s so much evidence that it ’ s bad for children. ” she says the karnes family detention center, which is unlicensed and holds men and boys, is not fit for children. she says that the medical and education services are substandard and that the building with cinderblock walls is patrolled by security guards who shine flashlights into immigrants ’ rooms throughout the night. “ it ’ s very much like a prison they put some paint on and hung up some cute kids ’ posters in, ” she says. danielle bennett, an immigration and customs enforcement spokesperson, told outletname that its three family detention centers in the u. s. include “ medical care, play rooms, social workers, educational services, and access to legal counsel. ” “ ice takes very seriously the health, safety and welfare of those in our care, ” she said in an email to outletname. “ ice is committed to ensuring the welfare of all those in the agency ’ s custody, including providing access to necessary and appropriate medical care. ” meza says ice is keeping these men and boys unnecessarily detained, since they all have family members in the u. s. they could be released to. last year the average detention time in children ’ s - only shelters ballooned to 59 days ― almost double the average stay during the final year of the obama administration ― and the raices complaint states that prolonged detention is part of a “ disturbing recent trend ” that violates the civil rights and liberties of immigrant families. mental health professionals have",0.999985337257385,0.499985372865922,1,418,2.39,5.26,10.05,2.63,0.48,6.94,4.78,1.2,0.72,0.48,0.48,0.24,1.67,0.0,0.96,0.0,0.24,0.24,14.35,1.91,0.0,0.96,0.96,0.24,0.48,5.02,0.0,0.0,3.83,3.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.48,7.89,0.24,6.94,0.48,0.0,0.0,4.31,1.44,5.02,0.24,7.655502392344498,9.808612440191387,2.15311004784689
HuffPost,"President-elect Donald Trump’s attorney general pick, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), tried to skirt questions about the fate of young undocumented immigrants by saying Congress should work together to pass immigration reform ― even though he has prominently opposed every recent attempt to do so.
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) wasn’t having it.
“There is not a spot of evidence in your public career to suggest that as attorney general you would use the authority of that office to resolve the challenges of our broken immigration system in a fair and humane manner,” Durbin said to Sessions at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. “Tell me I’m wrong.”
The attorney general is not in charge of most deportation efforts ― that falls to the Department of Homeland Security. But should he be confirmed, Sessions would still have plenty of power to affect immigration matters, from shaping the resources immigration courts receive and how they make decisions to pressuring local law enforcement to assist in deportation efforts.
Sessions said that Durbin was “wrong” about what his record indicates he’d do as attorney general, but he also defended his support of limiting immigration and increasing deportations.
“I believe the American people spoke clearly in this election,” Sessions said. “I believe they agreed with my basic view and I think it’s a good view, a decent view, a solid legal view for the United States of America that we create a lawful system of immigration that allows people to apply to this country and if they’re accepted, they get in; if they’re not accepted, they don’t get in.”
The Department of Justice, I think, could have no objection to a decision to abandon [the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program] because it is very questionable, in my opinion, constitutionally. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.)
He was less direct, however, about what should happen to so-called Dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, if or when Trump ends President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The program has granted more than 750,000 undocumented young people temporary work permits and authorization to stay in the country.
Sessions opposes DACA, and said he would not object to Trump ending it as he’s promised to do.
“It would certainly be constitutional, I believe, to end that order and I would ― the Department of Justice, I think, could have no objection to a decision to abandon that order because it is very questionable, in my opinion, constitutionally,” Sessions said.
But he was reticent to say what should happen to current DACA recipients. In December, Trump said he was “going to work something out” for Dreamers “that’s going to make people happy and proud.”
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who supports ending DACA but also advocates protecting Dreamers through legislation, asked what should be done for them.
“I really would urge us all to work together,” Sessions said. “I would try to be supportive to end the illegality and put us in a position where we can wrestle with how to handle these difficult, compassionate decisions.”
“And the best way to do it is for Congress and the administration to work together and pass a law, not an executive order,” Graham responded. Sessions agreed.
Those comments are what Durbin seized on later in the hearing. “You said, let Congress pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill,” Durbin said. “You opposed the only bipartisan effort that we’ve had on the Senate floor in modern memory.”
Sessions said that was in his capacity as a senator, not as attorney general. In the latter role, he indicated, Dreamers wouldn’t be a priority for deportation. He also admitted that “we’re not able financially or any other way to seek out and remove everybody that’s in the country illegally” ― but gave little indication of what exactly should happen to their current protections.
“President Trump has indicated that criminal aliens, like President Obama indicated, certainly are the top group of people [for deportation] ... Let’s fix this system and then we can work together after this lawlessness has been ended,” he said.","president - elect donald trump ’ s attorney general pick, sen. jeff sessions ( r - ala. ), tried to skirt questions about the fate of young undocumented immigrants by saying congress should work together to pass immigration reform ― even though he has prominently opposed every recent attempt to do so. sen. dick durbin ( d - ill. ) wasn ’ t having it. “ there is not a spot of evidence in your public career to suggest that as attorney general you would use the authority of that office to resolve the challenges of our broken immigration system in a fair and humane manner, ” durbin said to sessions at a senate judiciary committee hearing. “ tell me i ’ m wrong. ” the attorney general is not in charge of most deportation efforts ― that falls to the department of homeland security. but should he be confirmed, sessions would still have plenty of power to affect immigration matters, from shaping the resources immigration courts receive and how they make decisions to pressuring local law enforcement to assist in deportation efforts. sessions said that durbin was “ wrong ” about what his record indicates he ’ d do as attorney general, but he also defended his support of limiting immigration and increasing deportations. “ i believe the american people spoke clearly in this election, ” sessions said. “ i believe they agreed with my basic view and i think it ’ s a good view, a decent view, a solid legal view for the united states of america that we create a lawful system of immigration that allows people to apply to this country and if they ’ re accepted, they get in ; if they ’ re not accepted, they don ’ t get in. ” the department of justice, i think, could have no objection to a decision to abandon [ the deferred action for childhood arrivals program ] because it is very questionable, in my opinion, constitutionally. sen. jeff sessions ( r - ala. ) he was less direct, however, about what should happen to so - called dreamers, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the u. s. as children, if or when trump ends president barack obama ’ s deferred action for childhood arrivals program, known as daca. the program has granted more than 750, 000 undocumented young people temporary work permits and authorization to stay in the country. sessions opposes daca, and said he would not object to trump ending it as he ’ s promised to do. “ it would certainly be constitutional, i believe, to end that order and i would ― the department of justice",0.99996280670166,0.49996277511309,1,408,0.49,1.96,10.05,0.98,1.47,7.35,11.27,3.19,1.72,2.21,1.23,0.74,3.19,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.95,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.21,0.0,0.0,5.88,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.11,1.96,3.68,0.98,0.25,0.0,2.7,2.7,1.23,0.49,7.352941176470589,10.049019607843137,1.9607843137254901
