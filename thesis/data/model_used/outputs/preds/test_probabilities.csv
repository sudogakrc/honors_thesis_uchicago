"journalists were quick to take to twitter and the airwaves as soon as president donald trump ’ s primetime plea for a border wall was broadcast tuesday evening. trump discussed public safety, economic and illicit drug issues he said stem from illegal immigration as the partial government shutdown triggered by his push for border wall funding hit day 18. members of the media reacted almost immediately. “ i see the president ’ s face but i hear stephen miller ’ s voice, ” tweeted maggie haberman of outletname, referring to trump ’ s senior policy advisor who has defended shutting down the government for border security. “ how is this a call for bipartisanship? ” she added. other journalists appeared in network fact checks between trump ’ s address and democrats ’ rebuttal. “ just because you say it ’ s a crisis doesn ’ t necessarily make it one, ” cecilia vega of outletname said, referencing trump ’ s characterization of the issue as a “ crisis at our southern border. ” others called trump racist. “ sickening to hear trump try to bait the latino and black communities with false, racist trope about immigrants taking jobs, ” tweeted outletname political commentator karen finney. “ if he really cared about people of color in the u. s. he would stop his nativist agenda and would ’ ve easily denounced the kkk in charlottesville for starters. ” “ why is trump asking for more money for his wall now that democrats control the u. s. house than he did when the republicans controlled everything? he needs to create a fight to distract from muller muller muller muller, ” finney later tweeted. washington post media reporter erik wemple found trump ’ s address to be more of the same. “ looks like the white house secured major network tv time for an address that repeats all of the president ’ s arguments on immigration, only, this time, through a teleprompter, ” wemple wrote on twitter.","[0.9998915195465088, 0.00010842935444088653]"
"in june, josue, a 21 - year - old honduran, reached a safe house in the mexican border city of reynosa, tamaulipas. he was there with 11 other central american migrants. his family had spent the previous year scraping together the $ 3, 800 necessary for this last part of his journey to the united states. but the “ safe ” house was not so safe. only miles from the border, his migration was interrupted as armed men burst into the house, kidnapping the migrants and demanding an additional $ 1, 800 for their release. if their families couldn ’ t raise the money, the armed men warned, the migrants would be killed. every day, dramas and tragedies like this play out for the honduran, salvadoran and guatemalan migrants traveling through mexico. the trump administration ’ s rhetoric has repeatedly linked migrants to gangs, violence and crime, and cast undocumented immigrants as a threat to public safety. but in fact, a majority of the central americans arriving at the united states - mexico border are not perpetrators but rather victims of violence, both in their home countries and during their fraught transit through mexico. over the past three decades, the risks and dangers on the journey from central america to the united states border have increased — ramped - up united states and mexican migratory enforcement has pushed migrants onto more invisible, risky paths, and impunity in mexico for criminal perpetrators has kept them on the streets. yet however daunting the risks and challenging the policies, they have not significantly put a dent in the number of central americans traveling north. what has changed is that hundreds of thousands of migrants make the journey to the united states along more clandestine and treacherous routes. for central american migrants, there is no single transportation method or route to travel through mexico to reach the united states. travel experiences are influenced by a migrant ’ s nationality, gender, age and income. if a central american migrant hires a smuggler for transiting through mexico — and 60 percent report hiring these guides in surveys conducted by the colegio de la frontera norte — then the routes will also be determined by the smugglers ’ contacts and methods. but they all have at least one thing in common : not one is safe, and each comes with a series of risks. as soon as migrants near mexico ’ s southern border with guatemala, the dangers begin. to reach mexico ’ s southernmost cities, migrants with a bit of money can take local buses or hire taxis. those with empty wallets must","[2.344499807804823e-05, 0.9999765157699585]"
"a massachusetts county sheriff has proposed sending prison inmates from around the united states to build the proposed wall along the mexican border that is one of u. s. president - elect donald trump ’ s most prominent campaign promises. “ i can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our country than building this wall, ” bristol county sheriff thomas hodgson said at his swearing - in ceremony for a fourth term in office late wednesday. “ aside from learning and perfecting construction skills, the symbolism of these inmates building a wall to prevent crime in communities around the country, and to preserve jobs and work opportunities for them and other americans upon release, can be very powerful, ” he said. hodgson, who like trump is a republican, said inmates from around the country could build the proposed wall, described by trump as a powerful deterrent to illegal immigration. trump, who will be sworn in on jan. 20, insisted during his campaign that he would convince the mexican government to pay for the wall, though mexican officials have repeatedly said they would not do so. officials in the trump transition office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. the united states has a long history of prison labor, with advocates of the idea saying that putting inmates to work can help them learn skills that prepare them for their return to society after completing their sentences. opponents contend that inmates are not fairly compensated. the federal prisons system operates some 53 factories around the united states that produced about $ 500 million worth of clothing, electronics, furniture and other goods in the fiscal year ended sept. 30, according to its financial statements. still, an attorney for the american civil liberties union in massachusetts said hodgson ’ s proposal could violate prisoners ’ rights. “ the proposal is perverse, it ’ s inhumane and very likely unconstitutional, ” aclu staff counsel laura rotolo said in a phone interview. “ it certainly has nothing to do with helping prisoners in massachusetts or their families. it ’ s about politics. ” in response to a request by the trump transition office, the department of homeland security last month identified more than 400 miles ( 644 km ) along the u. s. - mexico border where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by outletname. the document contained an estimate that building that section of fence would cost more than $ 11 billion.","[3.92861693399027e-05, 0.9999606609344482]"

"president donald trump signed an executive order wednesday designed to crack down on so - called sanctuary cities - - setting up a showdown with immigration advocates. the order will "" strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants, "" according to press secretary sean spicer. the order declares that entities labeled "" sanctuary jurisdictions "" by the secretary of the department of homeland security will be "" not eligible "" for federal grants, and it directs the office of management and budget to compile federal grant money currently going to sanctuary jurisdictions. already, some mayors have made clear they're standing firm. at a news conference just moments after trump's executive order was announced, chicago mayor rahm emanuel said his city wouldn't budge.

"president donald trump wants a border wall so badly that he ’ s willing to sustain what on saturday became the longest federal government shutdown in u. s. history. but for all his bluster, trump has not racked up the draconian immigration enforcement record he threatened from the campaign trail. by the most important enforcement metric, deportations, trump has trailed far behind his more liberal predecessor barack obama. immigration and customs enforcement deported about 95, 000 people from the interior of the united states last year. interior deportations in obama ’ s first three years in office topped 200, 000 annually. only in his final two years in office did obama register numbers lower than trump ’ s. trump ’ s comparatively low deportation numbers are no coincidence : they are a direct result of the administration ’ s chaotic attempts to overhaul the immigration system. each ill - planned and legally dubious move the trump administration makes to change the enforcement system clogs up some part of the federal bureaucracy and makes it harder for the administration to achieve its stated goals. the self - defeating quest for the wall trump ’ s fixation on the wall ― or fence, or steel slats, or “ peaches, ” or whatever he ’ s calling it this week ― is a great example of how his policies tend to kneecap immigration enforcement. the federal government is responsible for enforcing immigration law, so no one truly obsessed with deporting people would allow the federal government to shut down because that would further jam up a complex enforcement system that is already backlogged in the federal courts by more than 1 million cases. that ’ s exactly what ’ s happening. the country ’ s immigration courts are largely closed. those who miss their court dates because of the shutdown are getting sent to the back of the line, according to outletname ― which can mean delays of up to four years. as of last week, nearly 43, 000 hearings had been canceled, according to the transactional records access clearinghouse project at syracuse university ― with an additional 20, 000 or so cancellations expected for every week the shutdown drags on. ice is about to blow through its detention budget again, raising legal questions about whether the agency can continue to detain some of the people in its custody, according to buzzfeed. these are not the kinds of results one would expect with a hard - liner in the white house. but it ’ s a perfectly logical outcome for trump, who campaigned on a border wall to solve a contrived crisis of illegal immigration at a time when","[1.875301131804008e-05, 0.9999812841415405]"
"every new illegal immigrant that enters the united states will cost more than $ 82, 000 each over their lifetime, a conservative think tank that advocates for lower immigration levels has claimed. the center for immigration studies updated their 2012 analysis which put the average lifetime net fiscal cost of a border crosser at $ 74, 722. in the six years since, the price has jumped to $ 82, 191. the think tank ’ s analysis has come into question however, with multiple outlets pushing back on its numbers and methodology. the new figure by the cis estimates what it takes to protect the border, educate, house and feed illegal immigrants and makes the assumption they will spend a lifetime on various welfare programs. this estimate means that for every 100, 000 illegal immigrants that are stopped from crossing the border, it would save taxpayers $ 8. 2 billion over the illegal immigrants ’ lifetimes, the report states. the report also concludes that a southern border wall between the u. s. and mexico would only have to stop four percent of undocumented migrants, or about 60, 000 over the next 10 years, to recoup the cost of president trump ’ s $ 5 billion funding ask. almost everyone has come up with a different price tag on the cost of illegal immigration. president trump, for example, has touted several different estimates. during a cabinet meeting in late december, trump put the price of illegal immigration as high as $ 275 billion. “ i ’ ve heard numbers as high as $ 275 billion we lose on illegal immigrants, ” he said. “ the $ 5, $ 5. 6 billion approve by the house is such a small amount compared to the level of the problem. ” in early december, trump said illegal immigration cost $ 250 billion per year. on dec. 18, he said it was “ more than $ 250 billion ” per year. that number jumped dramatically two days later when he claimed, “ illegal immigration cost our nation $ 275 billion a year. ” meg wiehe, deputy director at the nonpartisan institute on taxation and economic policy, told outletname that trump ’ s figure “ sounds extraordinarily high to me. ” david dyssegaard kallick, deputy director of the nonpartisan fiscal policy institute, was more blunt, calling the numbers “ frankly absurd. ” cis research director steven camarota says even though experts may disagree over his numbers, one thing is clear - a border wall with mexico will eventually pay for itself by reducing taxpayer burdens. “ the range of reasonable assumption indicated","[0.9995971322059631, 0.0004028618277516216]"

"the supreme court friday sided with a korean immigrant who faced deportation as a result of faulty legal advice he received from his criminal defense attorney. in a 6 - 2 opinion written by chief justice john roberts, the court explained that a decision to risk almost certain conviction at trial in hopes of avoiding deportation is reasonable. the opinion was joined by justices anthony kennedy, ruth bader ginsburg, stephen breyer, sonia sotomayor, and elena kagan. justice clarence thomas wrote a dissent joined by justice samuel alito. the case arose in 2009 when a lawful permanent resident named jae lee was arrested for possessing ecstasy with intent to distribute. lee and his family immigrated to the united states when he was 13. he resided in the u. s. for over 20 years, operated two successful restaurants in the memphis, tenn. suburbs, and never returned to his native korea. after his arrest, lee accepted a plea deal from federal prosecutors to serve 366 days in prison. though he repeatedly expressed concerns to his lawyer about the prospect of deportation, he was assured that accepting the plea bargain would not result in his removal from the united states. the advice, however, was incorrect, and the government announced it would deport lee at the conclusion of his prison sentence. lee sought to have his plea and conviction set aside for ineffective assistance of counsel. lee argued avoiding deportation was the most important factor in his decision making, and that his choice to accept his lawyer ’ s advise turned on the assurance he would not be removed. the government countered that lee could not show he had been prejudiced by his lawyer ’ s bad advise, because the evidence against him, overwhelming and incontrovertible, guaranteed a conviction and removal. the court disagreed with the government, finding that success at trial should not drive the inquiry. roberts writes : but common sense ( not to mention our precedent ) recognizes that there is more to consider than simply the likelihood of success at trial. the decision whether to plead guilty also involves assessing the respective consequences of a conviction after trial and by plea. when those consequences are, from the defendant ’ s perspective, similarly dire, even the smallest chance of success at trial may look attractive. for example, a defendant with no realistic defense to a charge carrying a 20 - year sentence may nevertheless choose trial, if the prosecution ’ s plea offer is 18 years. here lee alleges that avoiding deportation was the determinative factor for him ; deportation after some time in prison was not meaningfully different from deportation after somewhat less time. he says","[2.7073932869825512e-05, 0.999972939491272]"

"in a primetime televised address tuesday, president donald trump repeated his demand for $ 5. 7 billion in border wall money in order to end the nearly three - week federal government shutdown, offering the deal as the only solution to solve a major national security crisis. “ this barrier is absolutely critical to border security. it ’ s also what our professionals at the border want and need, ” trump said, describing the impasse as a “ choice between right and wrong, between justice and injustice. ” but the only thing resembling a crisis on the u. s. - mexico border isn ’ t an existential threat to national security ― it ’ s the question of how to handle a historically high number of central american families and children coming into the country, many of whom are asking for asylum or some other humanitarian relief from deportation. the white house position on the issue is clear : trump wants to either indefinitely detain the central american migrants or cast them back to mexico. but the wall won ’ t achieve either of those aims. instead, the ploy harkens back to the symbolic solution to a largely fabricated crisis that paved trump ’ s way to the presidency back in 2016. there was no border crisis when trump launched his campaign in the summer of 2015, promising to wall off the southern border. instead, unauthorized crossings stood at their lowest levels since the 1970s. by the numbers, there ’ s still no crisis ― the unauthorized population of the united states has remained flat for more than a decade. what has changed in recent years is that more of the migrants who do cross without authorization are central american asylum seekers ― often traveling together as families or unaccompanied minors. that trend, which began in the summer of 2014, predates trump. but since he took office, the number of central american families crossing has risen to historic highs. in 2010, just 10 percent of all migrants apprehended by border patrol were families and unaccompanied children ― instead, most were single men. as of november 2018, families and unaccompanied children make up 57 percent of those apprehended. the trump administration has constantly rehauled the immigration enforcement system to scare off the migrant families and children. but none of it ― “ zero tolerance ” prosecutions for petty immigration offenses, a six - week experiment with systematic family separation, the mobilization of the national guard and u. s. military, a court - enjoined policy barring migrants from asking for asylum ― have stopped them from arriving. that trend","[2.825356750690844e-05, 0.9999717473983765]"

"for the fourth time in four months, trump administration officials have refused to let an undocumented immigrant teenager seek an abortion, forcing her to sue to get one, according to a court filing thursday. the teenager, who came to the united states without authorization as an unaccompanied minor, alleges in a complaint that she asked to go to a clinic to terminate her pregnancy using her own funds two weeks ago, and has not to be allowed to do so. it ’ s yet another example of the trump administration ’ s office of refugee resettlement ( orr ) refusing a girl in its custody access to abortion. the american civil liberties union, which is representing the teenagers, argues the administration ’ s actions are a violation of the girls ’ constitutional rights. the girls ’ treatment is a result of policies by orr director scott lloyd that allow him or other officials to essentially veto immigrant teens ’ abortions as long as the individuals are in government custody. lloyd described abortion as “ killing a human being ” in an internal document revealed as part of the broader lawsuit against orr, referring to a separate case of an immigrant teen seeking an abortion. that teenager was the victim of a rape, and was eventually allowed to terminate her pregnancy after court intervention. “ the trump administration is effectively banning abortion for these young women, ” brigitte amiri, senior staff attorney with the aclu reproductive freedom project, said in a statement on thursday about the latest teen seeking an abortion, referred to as “ jane moe. ” “ we ’ ve already stopped the government from forcing three other ‘ janes ’ to continue pregnancies against their will, but clearly, their heartlessness knows no bounds, ” amiri said. “ this administration is blatantly ignoring the fact that the supreme court has held that abortion is a fundamental constitutional right. ” orr officials “ have pushed ms. moe further into her pregnancy, ” according to the complaint filed in court by the aclu. “ without this court ’ s immediate intervention, defendants will continue to deny ms. moe the ability to access abortion, and ultimately will force her to carry to term against her will, ” the complaint reads. the past three teenagers represented by the aclu were eventually able to obtain abortions against the government ’ s wishes. in court, trump administration officials have argued that they are not blocking teens ’ access to abortion, because the individuals in question can agree to return to their native country ― potentially one that bars abortion or that they ’ ve left to seek asylum in the u. s.","[1.9254362996434793e-05, 0.9999806880950928]"

"much of the public debate around immigration in the u. s. and its costs and benefits centers on economic effects like job competition and added stress to public programs and benefits. one significant factor that gets missed by all the rhetoric is the role of the immigrant entrepreneur. immigrants and children of immigrants are the quintessential american entrepreneurs. they work hard to get here, and then they keep working after they arrive. they ’ re nearly twice as likely to start a business as their native - born counterparts! according to research by the ewing marion kauffman foundation, a whole 25 % of all engineering and tech companies in the u. s. founded between 2006 and 2012 had at least one founder who was an immigrant. and not only have immigrants consistently been more entrepreneurial than native - born citizens, but in recent years that gap has been gradually growing. these immigrant entrepreneurs have to be included in any serious reckoning of immigration and its costs and benefits. but regardless of their effect on the economy as a whole, we can look to these innovators as role models to study. what makes immigrants so likely to start their own businesses, and what can we learn from them? determined to succeed entrepreneur magazine says that of the companies in the u. s. fortune 500, upwards of 40 % were founded by first - or second - generation immigrants, even though immigrants only make up 13. 5 % of the total population. so what sets this population apart? what gives them the push to innovate and take risks where native - born americans don ’ t? one obvious distinction that sets the immigrant population apart is the simple fact of having gone through the immigration process. it takes determination and resilience to get through the process successfully, to be undeterred by setbacks and to keep trying and seeking out viable pathways to immigrate. for people to make it through the challenging, complex and ambiguous immigration system, they have to bring those qualities with them or pick them up on the way. and then they have to be able to deal with being an outsider once they arrive. and no matter how bad conditions are in your home country, it takes courage and a willingness to take on significant risks to get up and leave. that determination and resilience serve them well in bringing them here and helping them adjust to their new environment, and it continues to serve many of them well as they go about making a living and starting their own businesses. and that ’ s one way we can emulate immigrant entrepreneurs. even though native - born citizens","[6.705619307467714e-05, 0.9999328851699829]"
