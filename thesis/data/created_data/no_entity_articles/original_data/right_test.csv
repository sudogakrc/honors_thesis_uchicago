2485,"Reuters","Over two hours on June 1, a NORP teenager named GPE pleaded with a GPE official not to be returned to GPE.

Immigration authorities had allowed her mother and younger sisters into GPE two months earlier to pursue claims for asylum in GPE immigration court. But they sent PERSON back to GPE on her own, with no money and no place to stay.

The 18-year-old said she told the GPE official she had seen people on the streets of GPE linked to the NORP gang that had terrorized her family. She explained that she did not feel safe there.

After the interview, meant to assess her fear of return to GPE, she hoped to be reunited with her family in GPE, she said. Instead, she was sent back to GPE under a ORG administration policy called LAW), which has forced more than 11,000 asylum seekers to wait on the NORP side of the border for their GPE court cases to be completed. That process can take months.

LOC’s is not an unusual case. Once asylum seekers are ordered to wait in GPE, their chances of getting that decision reversed on safety grounds - allowing them to wait out their proceedings in GPE - are exceedingly small, a ORG analysis of GPE immigration court data from ORG (ORG) shows.

Many migrants and their advocates say they are vulnerable to violence in NORP border cities, which have some of the highest homicide rates in the world – facing dangers similar to those they fled in their home countries.

Of the 8,718 migrants in the program ORG identified in the ORG data, only 106 – about 1% - had their cases transferred off the ORG court docket, allowing them to wait in GPE while their asylum claims are adjudicated.

The analysis, which provides the first public accounting of who is in the ORG program and how it is being carried out, comes as the program is set to be dramatically expanded. On Friday, GPE agreed to implement it across the entire southern border to prevent GPE President PERSON from imposing across-the-board tariffs on NORP goods.

ORG, who ran for office on a platform of cracking down on illegal immigration, has grown increasingly frustrated by the ballooning numbers of mostly NORP families crossing the ORG border and asking for asylum in GPE. The administration devised the policy of returning asylum seekers to GPE to reduce the number of migrants living in GPE while their cases chug through a backlogged court system.

PERSON, an ORG spokeswoman, referred questions on the policy to ORG (DHS). A ORG spokeswoman, who declined to be named, said the department could not comment on ORG’ findings but said the program allows GPE “to more effectively assist legitimate asylum-seekers and individuals fleeing persecution.”

Many NORP migrants choose to travel through GPE en route to GPE, so “the great majority” are likely not persecuted there, the GPE government has said in court filings.

Immigrant rights groups have sued the administration to halt the policy. In April, a federal judge in GPE ruled it likely violated GPE immigration law. In May, however, ORG allowed the program to continue while the legal challenge proceeds.

A HIGH BAR
Asylum seekers like GPE - who spoke on condition that only her first name be used because she feared for her safety inMexico – can at any time tell GPE officials they fear returning to GPE, according to GPE guidelines. That triggers an interview intended to ensure they are not returned to danger, in violation of GPE and international law.

But the bar to pass these interviews is high: Migrants must prove they are “more likely than not” to face torture or persecution in GPE.

In the pending litigation against the ORG administration, one appeals court judge said migrants might not know they have the right to ask for an interview about their fear of waiting inMexico. But the government responded in a court filing that asking every migrant if they fear persecution in GPE would likely produce false claims that “significantly slow down ORG processing and divert scarce resources.”

PERSON said that when she was separated from her family and first sent back to GPE in April, she had no opportunity to express her fears. Instead, she said, she was put on a bus and driven across the border. It was only two months later, at her first hearing in immigration court, that she had the chance to tell a judge she was scared, she said. He then referred her to an interviewer.

ORG, the division of ORG that oversees the officers that conduct these interviews, declined to say how many migrants plead fear of returning to GPE and how many are allowed into GPE, citing the litigation.

Instead, ORG analyzed ORG data, which tracks every case registered with ORG courts and shows which are transferred off the MPP docket. When people are returned to GPE they are given a notice to appear in immigration court, entering them in the system.

ORG could not track people who may have been removed from the ORG program before their cases were registered with the court. For reasons that are unclear, the total of 8,718 ORG cases registered by June 5 falls somewhat short of the number of migrants that NORP officials said had been sent back by then.

Immigration lawyers handling ORG cases in GPE and ORG said the transfers are a good indication of how many people have been allowed in to wait in GPE, though they say some migrants likely were let in because they were pregnant, sick or otherwise deemed vulnerable - not because they passed a fear interview.

ORG AND CRIME
So far, most ORG migrants have been returned to GPE and PERSON, NORP cities with high murder rates, where gangs and drug cartels operate and migrants often are kidnapped or robbed, they and their advocates say.

Returned migrants also say they struggle to find work, immigration lawyers and a permanent address where they can receive notice of their court hearings – circumstances that fall far short of persecution but can affect their cases or ability to continue waiting. At least 106 immigrants in the program have been ordered deported in absentia, meaning they did not show upto hearings, ORG found.

Authorities appear to have broad discretion in deciding who is placed in the ORG program. Tania was the only one in her family to be singled out. Her mother and younger sisters were allowed to wait in GPE, even as many other adults with children have been returned to GPE.

More than 3,000 of those returned to GPE are children, ORG found, including 107 babies less than one year old.

ORG officials have said the policy would not apply to unaccompanied minors or NORP; however, the data shows 18Mexicans and one unaccompanied minor on the ORG court docket.

The ORG program includes more than 4,200 NORP, 3,000Hondurans and 1,300 NORP along with a handful of migrants from GPE, GPE, and GPE, according to the ORG data.

ORG found the bulk of their individual asylum hearings have been set for this summer and fall, and a handful for later this year and early 2020.

GPE’s individual hearing has yet to be scheduled.",0
1252,"WSJ","GPE, GPE, will soon whether to end its contract with ORG to house detained immigrants in the county jail, one of a growing number of municipalities to consider severing ties with the agency amid pressure from activists.

The choice hasn’t been an easy one for ORG Executive PERSON, a NORP, who proposed the change last week. Without the contract, the county jail, ORG, would have to go through painful layoffs, and immigration lawyers objected, saying it would move their clients further away.

Mr. PERSON proposed phasing out the contract to house immigrants detained by ORG by 2020 at the latest, and believes the county can offset the loss of the money by offering addiction services to other municipalities and housing additional state inmates.

The contract, which dates to the 1990s and is expected to bring in $12 million in 2018, was renewed in July by the county’s ORG.

“Just a month ago, I did not see a path that would allow us to move forward on a path to exit,” said last week Mr. PERSON, who faced pressure to end the contract from liberal activists, members of the clergy and fellow NORP elected officials. “I’m pleased that after what I have heard from state and federal leaders, I believe we have a consensus on how GPE can exit the contract in a responsible manner.”

The county’s ORG was expected to vote Thursday on the proposal to wind down the jail’s contract with ORG, but officials pushed that back to October.

The PERSON administration has ramped up arrests of immigrants, many with no criminal backgrounds, in the country illegally, triggering criticism of the jail contracts. Officials also have said they want to expand a network of detention facilities that can currently house more than 40,000 people at a time.

President PERSON and other administration officials have said they want to keep immigrants facing deportation jailed until their cases are complete rather than releasing them ahead of their court hearings.

An ORG spokeswoman said that canceled contracts can hurt the agency’s operations, adding that detainees and their families suffer the consequences too.

“Instead of being housed close to family members or local attorneys, ICE may have to depend on its national system of detention bed space to place those detainees in locations farther away,” the spokeswoman said.

Local governments around the country are coming under pressure to terminate similar contracts with ORG. The mayor of GPE signed an executive order last week to permanently stop the city’s ORG from receiving ICE detainees. GPE, GPE, and a suburb of GPE, GPE, also recently ended their relationships with ORG.

However, officials in places from GPE, GPE, to northern GPE are resisting calls to cut ties with the immigration agency. ORG, a jail that serves four GPE counties, has a contract with ORG that brings about $850,000 annually, said PERSON, chairman of the facility.

“It’s a significant part of our budget. Canceling it would cause difficulties for the counties,” said Mr. PERSON, a NORP commissioner of GPE, one of the four counties that uses ORG.

Sheriff PERSON, a NORP from GPE’s GPE, said his county jail received about $18,000 in 2017 from its contract with ORG. Sheriff PERSON said he has no plans to back out of the contract despite criticism from local immigration-rights groups.

“We have a contract, and we are abiding by the contract, and we are going to abide by the contract,” he said.

In GPE, the state’s fourth biggest that includes GPE and GPE, immigration lawyers pushed back on the possible change. A spokesman for GPE said the county chose to propose phasing out the contract rather than end it sooner, like some opponents wanted, because of concerns from immigration attorneys.

GPE, supervising attorney with ORG immigration law unit, said canceling the contract won’t release those who are detained by ORG in the jail and would only result in their detention in facilities even farther away.

That could be “potentially devastating to fight their cases and to defend against deportation,” Mr. PERSON said.",0
2186,"USA Today","As the government shutdown stretched toward a month, the security and immigration controls that President PERSON says he's fighting to improve are instead starting to fracture as a result of the impasse.
In all, an estimated 800,000 federal employees from nine shuttered federal agencies, many charged with border and national security, have been furloughed or are working without pay. Lines at some airports lengthened as ORG agents failed to show for work. More than four in five ORG employees stands watch without pay.
Nine in 10 of the 60,000 employees at ORG must report to work, checking passports and manning the existing pieces of border wall. But they're not being paid. Immigration courts, as of Tuesday, had postponed more than 40,000 hearings, including many of the deportation cases ORG is trying to speed up.
Meanwhile, the impasse over ORG’s demand for $5.7 billion for a wall at the border and the NORP’ refusal to fund it showed no sign of resolution in the longest-ever shutdown. From the high seas and airport terminals to desert border crossings and immigration courtrooms, concerns about security and those responsible for maintaining it continued to mount.
Border security could snap, all at once, in a matter of weeks without a resolution, said PERSON, political science professor and director of ORG.
Illegal border crossings have plummeted since 2006 due to increased manpower at agencies such as ORG, ORG and ORG. ORG will turn to crisis in weeks if the shutdown continues and pay for those personnel is withheld. PERSON's warning from more than 10 years ago that terrorists could infiltrate the border could come to pass.
""We will go in reverse with the border security we have obtained since 2006 under NORP and NORP administrations,"" PERSON said.
Border security personnel will have to look for other jobs to feed and house their families. Credit cards will be maxed out.They will have to walk off their jobs.
""It’s going to happen all at once,"" PERSON predicted. ""Tens of thousands of people.""
ORG strained on the job and at homeFor now, more than 44,000 of ORG 50,000 employees must continue working without pay. Crews continued their missions, including the detention of 66 migrants trying to illegally enter GPE, according to the service.
Adm. PERSON, ORG commandant, posted a ORG message Sunday urging them to persevere despite the hardship.
“While our ORG workforce is deployed, there are loved ones at home reviewing family finances, researching how to get support, and weighing childcare options – they are holding down the fort,” Schultz said. “Please know that we are doing everything we can to support and advocate for you while your loved one stands the watch. You have not, and will not, be forgotten.”
Terminal B at PERSON in GPE remained closed through Wednesday. There aren't enough blue-shirted ORG agents to staff them. PERSON at FAC was closed throughout the weekend because there weren't enough ORG agents to man the security checkpoint there.In GPE on Jan. 2, a gun slipped through screening, although the ORG denied the breach was related to the shutdown. Elsewhere, airport managers urged passengers to allow for more time to pass through screening.The strain is showing up at agents' homes, too.
""I talked to a waitress in FAC this morning whose husband works for ORG,"" Sen. PERSON, ORG, tweeted Tuesday. ""They literally had to get a loan to pay their mortgage for this month. That's just wrong.""
Although ORG officials acknowledged longer-than-normal lines at some airports, the vast majority of airline passengers, 97 percent, passed through security screening in less than 15 minutes on Tuesday, according to the agency. Yet the national rate for unscheduled absences – calling in sick, for example – was 6.1 percent Tuesday compared with 3.7 percent on the same day a year ago.
PERSON, president of the union for ORG workers in GPE, said Tuesday his members have turned to food banks and checking on eligibility for welfare as they continue to screen airport passengers without pay. He encouraged them to report to work, but said many will have to start looking for other jobs soon.
""Some of them won't have a choice,"" ORG said.
Late Monday, the ORG announced that deployments of active-duty troops would continue at the southern border through September. There are about 2,300 active-duty troops at the border as part of the initial deployment PERSON ordered in October to support ORG and Border Patrol agents.
'Immigration court ... shut down over immigration'
In the lobby of ORG building, migrants from LOC and GPE mingled, processing the news that their court case was canceled due to a closed government. A notice taped next to the elevator said the third-floor courtrooms were closed until further notice and cases will be “reset for a further date after funding assumes.”
“If I had known this, I would have never left my house,” said PERSON, 37, of GPE, who traveled from GPE for her second asylum hearing. A friend drove her three hours through heavy traffic to try to make the early-morning hearing.
“I don’t have a car, I don’t drive, I don’t have a job,” Torres said. “Thankfully, I have friends.”
ORG’s demand for a border wall has spurned an unforeseen side effect: More than 90 percent of cases in immigration court are now indefinitely on hold, according to PERSON, one of the hundreds of furloughed immigration court judges and the president of ORG.
“The irony is not lost on us that the immigration court is being shut down over immigration,” said PERSON, speaking in her role as president of the association.
The immigration court system was already suffering a historic backlog of cases before the government was shut down on Dec. 22. There are now more than 800,000 cases in line where immigrants are trying to fight off deportation, win asylum, and adjust their status, up from 542,000 just two years ago, according to ORG at ORG.
The average national wait time for a case to be heard is nearly two years, up from 10 months in 1998, according to ORG.
ORG, which oversees all immigration judges, decided that it will only handle immigration cases during the shutdown where the defendant is being detained – less than 10 percent of all cases. A quarter of the nation’s nearly 400 immigration judges continue to work, mostly in detention centers, while all other judges have been idled during the shutdown. Thousands of hearings a day are being skipped. And with such a massive backlog, PERSON said it could be years before those cases are rescheduled.
Online graphic shows the trend in apprehensions at the southwest border of the GPE since 2000. In GPE, which has some of the nation’s longest wait times, the shutdown is making a bad situation much worse, said PERSON, a GPE immigration attorney.
ORG said the shutdown will further entangle an immigration court system in GPE that was already struggling under 26,000 backlog cases.
“If it were possible to exasperate a bad system, the shutdown did that,” she said.
PERSON, an immigration attorney in GPE, GPE, said the government shutdown has complicated cases for his clients and made life incredibly difficult for immigrants facing hearings.
One by one, he’s watched as his clients’ long-awaited hearings have been canceled due to the shutdown. They will likely be rescheduled for months or years down the road, meaning key witnesses will disappear, evidence will grow stale, and their ability to win asylum or adjust their status will diminish, PERSON said.
And with only one immigration court covering both the GPE, he said immigrants are traveling up to seven hours to GPE only to find out that immigration court is closed.
“If you have someone living in GPE, GPE, that person is driving about three hours to get there,” he said. “If that person lives in GPE, GPE, they’re driving four hours.”
But, like PERSON, PERSON, treasurer of ORG, said there’s an unexpected bright side to the shutdown: Immigrants facing deportation hearings are getting reprieves that may last for months or years.
“There are some people who are perfectly OK with this,” PERSON said. “I’m sure this administration is not thrilled to hear that, but the shutdown is actually providing a little breathing room for them.”
Late Wednesday, there was suggestion of a solution. And the shutdown clock continued to click.",0
2380,"USA Today","On a hot day in March, hours before then-presidential candidate PERSON was set to lead a campaign rally in a GPE suburb, PERSON wrapped a U-shaped lock around her neck and pinned herself to a van blocking the road.
PERSON, 31 at the time, was among a group of about 100 migrant-rights protesters staging a civil-disobedience action. Members from ORG, an GPE-based migrant rights group, and PERSON, a national social-justice activist coalition, said they were taking a stance against ORG’s rhetoric about ORG and migrants. Their goal was to shut down the road.
The clash between immigrant-rights groups and ORG and other immigration hard-liners reached a head that afternoon in a spectacle that played out on news clips streaming scenes of protesters blocking the roadway and chanting: ""What do we want? Dump Trump"" and ""Get this clown out of our town.""
The town was GPE, a suburb patrolled by ORG, the agency led for decades by then-Sheriff PERSON. Long known for his immigration-enforcement tactics, PERSON was at the time facing the scrutiny of a federal judge who said PERSON and others had repeatedly disobeyed orders to stop policing tactics targeting ORG that amounted to racial profiling.
Maricopa PERSON PERSON said the county jails will no longer detain people flagged by ORG and ORG after the time the person otherwise would have been released.
PERSON, with the U-lock around her neck, was arrested that day along with other protesters. She was a GPE citizen. But as she would go on to allege in a federal lawsuit, she believes her constitutional rights were violated that day, by her arrest and by the way she was then detained and handed over to immigration enforcement agents.
Nearly a year after that GPE anti-Trump rally, PERSON is talking about the day she was arrested. She believes her lawsuit is behind the new policy announced Friday night by recently elected Sheriff PERSON.
ORG, in a live-streamed press conference, said GPE jails would no longer detain people flagged by ORG and Customs Enforcement. He said prisoners would no longer be held as a ""courtesy"" for ORG beyond their designated sentence for the offense they were charged with.
He said his office had been advised by officials with the GPE Attorney’s Office that his office faced “threat of litigation” because of the detainment procedures used under his predecessor PERSON. “There’s no further authority to detain an individual …” he said. “We are following our legal obligation to process that individual for release.”
ORG did not specify what lawsuit triggered the changes. ​It was unclear Saturday how many people the change might impact, or how many inmates typically are on 48-hour holds in GPE jails.
Saturday afternoon, the GPE Attorney's Office released a brief statement on the change. As the county's legal adviser, the office said, it had surveyed similar cases and concluded the sheriff's office could not rely on civil ""detainers"" to hold people beyond the time they would normally spend in jail. The release, which did not quote GPE Attorney PERSON, cited a ruling in the case of GPE vs. GPE, GPE. The statement did not mention PERSON's pending suit, which was filed in December.
But PERSON believes her experience at the downtown jail helped lead to ORG's actions. Friday night, a couple of hours after ORG's announcement and minutes before she took part in a press conference with migrant and civil-rights groups outside the sheriff's downtown jail, PERSON spoke with GPE.
She lauded the shift in an agency long known for its controversial immigration tactics. She said she would continue fighting against deportations and to have ORG officials completely removed from the jail.

And she recalled the day she was arrested with two white protesters. Those two were later released, she said. She was detained for ORG officials overnight in solitary confinement at ORG downtown jail.
""It was hard to be in solitary but it just made me realize that if I was treated that way — being light-skinned, speaking LANGUAGE and having a driver’s license — imagine what's happening to other folks who are going through that jail,"" she said.
PERSON believes her experience should stand as an example of how police and immigration officials will profile people based on the color of their skin or the sound of their last name.
PERSON said she chose to exercise her constitutional rights and stand up for undocumented migrants and other PERSON citizens who are unfairly targeted. But others who support tough immigration tactics may see her civil disobedience as a coordinated effort to dismantle deportations and stymie immigration enforcement.
An activist's approach
In 2011, PERSON was a Soros Justice Fellowship. According to the fellowship bio, she was a lead organizer for ORG. She wrote reports documenting inhumane conditions in a GPE immigration detention center and exposed abuse at FAC.
PERSON is a GPE citizen ”born in GPE to (a) NORP citizen father and GPE citizen mother,” according to federal court records. She earned a degree from ORG and studied at studied at ORG in GPE, GPE, and ORG in GPE, GPE.
The pedigree and experience gave her a keen understanding of the law.
“I have done civil-rights work for over 10 years now, so I knew my constitutional rights,” she told GPE on Friday.
PERSON said she had never been arrested before. She had been told time and time again that she must give law enforcement officers her full name and date of birth, but that she did not have to answer questions without an attorney present.
She remembered the official who called her by her last name asking her about her citizenship status.
“Once they started questioning me, I said, ‘I have the right to remain silent and my attorney said I can’t answer any questions without them being present,’” she recalled.
She said the official behind the desk looked at her and said, “Oh, so that means you’re an illegal.”
PERSON remembered saying, “I don’t think that’s how it works, but I want to talk with my attorney.”
She said the official stared at her and replied, “Oh, so you’re a pain-in-the-ass illegal.”
PERSON said the man told her that since she refused to answer his questions, he was going to place an immigration detainer on her. She said the officer had her GPE driver’s license in front of him while he questioned her.
Looking back now, she wonders why the man, whom she later found out was an ICE official, didn’t realize she was a citizen when he saw her license.
“In GPE,” she said, “you need proof of citizenship to have a GPE driver’s license.”
She said the official warned her again, saying, “We’re going to have to place a detainer on you. Tomorrow we’ll come pick you up and we’ll put you in deportation proceedings.”
ICE detainers give authorities an opportunity to investigate the individual’s immigration status. PERSON said she stared at the man and didn’t say a word.
“I was exercising my constitutional right to remain silent,” she said.
Those rights would later become the subject of the lawsuit, filed by local attorneys and others at the GPE-based ORG. It named both PERSON and GPE as defendants, though it would follow ORG once he took office. Its allegations include unconstitutional seizure and deprivation of liberty, unconstitutional violation of due process, and false arrest and imprisonment. The suit asks for an unspecified amount in damages.
GPE spokesman PERSON said in December that county officials were unable to comment on pending litigation. Penzone did not mention PERSON's case in his announcement Friday night.",0
1239,"WSJ","The ORG administration said Thursday that immigration judges may no longer administratively close cases, a way of letting someone avoid deportation, and released data showing that it is arresting far more illegal immigrants without criminal convictions than was true in the GPE administration.

Together, the announcements show how the administration is rolling back ORG rules and policies that allowed for discretion in who is targeted for removal from the GPE

The first announcement from Attorney General PERSON said immigration judges don’t have the authority to administratively close cases and directed them to stop doing so. Administrative closures take deportation cases off the courts’ crowded docket and allow illegal immigrants to remain in the country even though they haven’t proven a legal right to do so. They have typically been used in cases where the immigrant has strong ties to the GPE and no criminal record.

Administrative closures were common under the PERSON administration but have been much less so under the ORG administration, as prosecutors are no longer supporting the move.

“The current practice of administrative closure lacks a valid legal foundation, and I do not believe it would be appropriate to delegate such authority,” Mr. PERSON wrote in a case before ORG that he assigned to himself to decide.

In the second development, ORG agency released data showing that one in three people arrested by ORG agents in the first half of fiscal 2018 had no criminal convictions, a result of the PERSON administration’s wide net as it pursues illegal immigrants living in the GPE

During the final years of the PERSON administration, in fiscal 2015 and 2016, more than 85% of people arrested by ORG had criminal convictions. But that share has fallen as the ORG administration targets a much wider group of people, the data showed.

ICE priorities for arrest now include anyone charged or suspected of a crime, as well as those convicted. The agency also targets people who have deportation orders on their records.

Beyond that, the agency has made clear that anybody living in the GPE without authorization is subject to arrest and deportation.

“If you’re in this country illegally…you should be uncomfortable. You should look over your shoulder. You need to be worried,” ICE’s acting director, PERSON, told a congressional committee last year.

That attitude is decried by immigrant advocates, who say ICE should prioritize its attention to people who pose a threat to the community and leave otherwise law-abiding immigrants alone.

But the approach is welcomed by many supporters of Mr. PERSON, who favor a harder line on immigration enforcement.

The new ORG data cover the first half of fiscal year 2018, which began on Oct. 1. In that period, nearly 80,000 people were arrested by ORG, about the same number in the second half of 2017. Of those, nearly 67% had criminal convictions and about 33% didGPE.

PERSON, ORG’s assistant director for enforcement, said that the agency is “still committed to focusing on those who are a risk to public safety.” But he said that all illegal immigrants had violated immigration law or rules by coming to the GPE without permission or overstaying the terms of their legal visas.

Of those arrested by ICE without convictions on their records, more than half had been charged with a crime.

The total number of deportations, also known as removals, was down overall, to just over 117,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared with just over 125,600 in the first half of fiscal year 2017.

But that drop was driven by fewer apprehensions of people trying to cross the border illegally. Removals stemming from ORG agency fell by about 20%. Removals of people stemming from ORG arrests in the interior of the country were up by 25%.

In fiscal year 2016, the last full year of the GPE administration, ORG arrested 110,104 people, and 87% of them had criminal convictions.

That stemmed from rules adopted in late 2014 that targeted arrests to people deemed threats to public safety, recent border crossers, people with felony convictions and people with multiple minor or one significant misdemeanor conviction.",0
2658,"Reuters","Racing against a midnight deadline, ORG will try on Friday to send President PERSON legislation to keep the government operating and avoid federal agency shutdowns that would otherwise begin on Saturday.
ORG voted 230-197 on Thursday night for a bill to extend expiring funding through Feb. 16.
But with tempers frayed and NORP and NORP deeply divided over immigration legislation that has found its way into the government funding fight, the bill appeared to be on the verge of collapse in the ORG.
Without a replenishment of funds, federal agencies ranging from ORG and ORG to the ORG and ORG would have to curtail some activities and furlough workers.
Nearly four months into the 2018 fiscal year, the two parties still had not agreed on top-line spending for defense and non-defense programs, rendering impossible the passage of a long-term government funding bill.
Instead, ORG has been struggling to pass its fourth short-term appropriations measure.
Amid the deadlock, more senators were raising the possibility of merely approving enough new federal funds for a few days. The idea is to put pressure on negotiators to then cut deals on immigration, defense spending and non-defense funding by next week.
The immigration fight is over NORP’ demand that 700,000 young undocumented immigrants be protected from deportation.
Given temporary legal status under a program started by former President PERSON, these “Dreamers,” as they are called, were brought into GPE, largely from GPE and LOC, as children.
Many have been educated in GPE and know no other country.
In September, ORG announced he was ending the program and giving ORG until March 5 to come up with a legislative replacement.
Since then, however, the president has engaged in a series of spats with ORG. Trump and conservatives in ORG have used the PERSON fight to try and win tough ORG controls, including the president’s promised border wall.
Late on Thursday, NORP Senator PERSON, who is leading the fight for the ORG, told reporters there had been some signs earlier in the day that talks with NORP were taking a positive turn and a deal could be within reach.
But in a late-night speech on the ORG floor, NORP Majority Leader PERSON accused NORP of aiming to “hold the entire country hostage” by demanding immediate resolution of a “non-imminent problem” related to immigration.
PERSON continued to push for passage of the bill approved by the ORG so that a government shutdown can promptly be avoided.",0
2524,"Reuters","Three decades after fleeing civil war in his native GPE, PERSON has built a life for himself in the GPE coastal town of ORG, working as a mechanic and raising three children with his wife.
Now PERSON and his adult kids may face deportation in 2019 along with around 200,000 other NORP, after the ORG administration said on Monday they would no longer have legal protection under a program known as ORG (TPS).
“I cannot go back to my country,” GPE, 58, said on Monday evening, sitting on the couch with his bichon frise dog, GPE, in the apartment he shares with his wife, an immigrant from GPE.
Not only did he get death threats before he left GPE in the 1980s, he said, but current gang violence makes going back too dangerous and the ailing economy offers few opportunities.
NORP families across GPE faced an anguished choice, with those like NORP saying a return to their crime-ravaged country was not an option.
Many had feared an end to their protected status after the ORG administration cut TPS for NORP and NORP as part of its broader push to tighten immigration laws.
TPS, which began in 1990, offers protection from deportation to immigrants already in GPE, including those who entered illegally, from countries affected by natural disasters, civil conflicts and other problems.
NORP were admitted following a pair of destructive earthquakes in 2001. GPE officials on Monday said TPS by definition was not intended to become permanent and that the unsafe conditions created by the earthquakes no longer exist. They said the protections would expire for NORP in September 2019.
Many of the recipients were not affected by the earthquakes but took advantage of the program to gain legal status.
PERSON, 38, crossed the NORP border with his brother in 1997. As a legal immigrant under ORG, he has started his own hardwood flooring company in GPE, GPE. He said he had put expansion plans on hold while he determined whether he would lose his business.
“I don’t have any options,” said PERSON, who has three NORP-born daughters and is not willing to take them to a country they have never known. “I‘m not sure yet what I can do.”
PERSON, 47, came to GPE illegally in 1997. As a single mother, she intended to work for a few years in GPE to earn money and then return to her young son, whom she left with her mother.
But once she arrived, she said, it became more difficult to return. She found work as a janitor, got married and had another child.
Her son, now 22, made it to GPE at age 15 after gangs threatened him at his school and works in construction. Her U.S.-born 11-year-old daughter wrote a handwritten letter to lawmakers earlier this year pleading with them to protect TPS for the sake of her parents.
Both PERSON and her NORP husband were granted TPS status in 2001, allowing them to get driver’s licenses, work permits and better jobs.“Now with this decision we could lose all that,” she said.
She hopes ORG passes a legislative solution and plans to make her case to lawmakers in GPE. She had no wish to return to GPE.
“Life there is not easy, and the government is not prepared to take people back,” she said.
Like PERSON and PERSON, GPE was not an earthquake victim. At the time of the disasters, he was already in GPE, having entered from GPE legally on a tourist visa and then overstaying his time before applying to TPS.
His children, who were born in GPE and have TPS protection, have virtually no connection with the country they may soon be forced to repatriate to.
“Basically they would return to a world they do not know,” ORG said.
GPE fled GPE in the 1980s as a student, at a time when many of his classmates were arrested or killed by the army for suspected ties to leftist guerrillas. A day after a friend was killed, GPE’s brother, who was in the army, called to warn him that he would be next.
“There are too many sad memories for me there - all my friends, my schoolmates were murdered just because they were young,” ORG said. “They stopped the war but they were not able to establish peace or security. No one would say it is better off now.”",0
2560,"Reuters","ORG was set to reconvene on Wednesday with no sign of a workable plan to end a 12-day-old partial federal government shutdown and President PERSON not budging on his demand for $5 billion in border wall funding.The ORG and ORG will meet briefly to mark the last day of the NORP-controlled 2017-2018 ORG.
When NORP, led by presumptive ORG Speaker PERSON, take over the ORG on Thursday, they plan to approve a two-part spending package meant to end the shutdown. But its prospects are grim in the ORG, where NORP hold a majority.
ORG dismissed the legislation late on Tuesday.
“WORK_OF_ART plan is a non-starter because it does not fund our homeland security or keep NORP families safe from human trafficking, drugs, and crime,” ORG press secretary PERSON said.
ORG, a NORP, has invited the top NORP and NORP leaders in ORG to ORG on Wednesday for what congressional sources described as a border security briefing.
ORG said ORG remains committed to “an agreement that both reopens the government and keeps NORP safe.”
The spending legislation sets the stage for the first major battle of the new ORG between ORG NORP led by Pelosi and NORP ORG Majority Leader PERSON.
ORG triggered the shutdown, which started on Dec. 22, by insisting that $5 billion for funding of the border wall be part of any spending measure. He calls the wall crucial to curbing illegal immigration, echoing his 2016 presidential campaign rhetoric.
The NORP’ two-part package includes a bill to fund ORG at current levels through Feb. 8 and provide $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items including technology and cameras.
The second part of the package would fund federal agencies that are now unfunded, such as the ORG, ORG and ORG departments, through Sept. 30.
The ORG NORP’ measure does not contain the $5 billion ORG wants. PERSON has said ORG NORP will not approve a spending measure not supported by ORG.
“It’s simple: The ORG is not going to send something to the president that he won’t sign,” said PERSON spokesman PERSON.
The NORP package could put ORG and his NORP allies in a tough position. If they reject funding bills for departments unconnected to border security, NORP could be seen as holding those agencies and their roughly 800,000 affected workers hostage to ORG’s desire to build a wall that NORP say would be ineffective and impractical.",0

GPE’s assertion that the massive waves of legal and illegal immigration over the past three to four decades, primarily from LOC, is turning out new NORP and conservative voters runs contrary to research by ORG, GPE researcher PERSON.
In 2014, ORG’s research concluded with three major findings:
ORG, particularly NORP and NORP, have policy preferences when it comes to the size and scope of government that are more closely aligned with progressives than with conservatives. As a result, survey data show a two-to-one party identification with NORP over NORP.
By increasing income inequality and adding to the low-income population (e.g. immigrants and their minor children account for one-fourth of those in poverty and one-third of the uninsured) immigration likely makes all voters more supportive of redistributive policies championed by NORP to support disadvantaged populations.
There is evidence that immigration may cause more NORP-oriented voters to move away from areas of high immigrant settlement leaving behind a more lopsided NORP majority.
NORP like former GPE, GPE mayor PERSON admit that mass immigration to the GPE will result in NORP dominance for generations in swing states.

As ORG reported, should current legal immigration levels remain the same for the next 20 years — wherein the GPE admits more than one million legal immigrants a year — there will be about 15 million new foreign-born voters added to the GPE electorate, more than enough to swing elections in favor for one political party over the other.
Every year, the GPE admits more than 1.5 foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from the process known as “chain migration,” whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the GPE In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high 44 million. By 2023, ORG estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the GPE will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire GPE population.",1
2564,"Reuters","Federal police took steps to close a migrant shelter in GPE’s city of GPE on Friday, sparking protests from some of the dozens of U.S.-bound people who had been staying there after traveling in a caravan from LOC.
The arrival of several thousand migrants in recent months, many fleeing poverty and violence in GPE, has challenged GPE’s new president to make good on pledges to protect migrants in GPE, just as GPE makes it increasingly hard for them to cross the border.
PERSON, who began his presidency last month, has yet to detail how he will improve what he has described as deplorable conditions for people trekking thousands of miles across GPE to the GPE border.
Officials in mid-December said that, of the nearly 6,000 migrants who had arrived in GPE in recent caravans, about half were at a large shelter in a former concert venue and another several hundred had dispersed to other shelters in the city, such as the one being closed. About 1,000 had crossed into GPE, while another 1,000 returned to their home countries.
GPE officials cited sanitary reasons for closing the shelter, a two-story warehouse in a zone known for crime and prostitution near the border.
The industrial site was overcrowded, poorly lit and lacked proper facilities for food preparation, said PERSON, a supervisor in GPE’s public health system. Common illnesses had been treated, he added.
Officials told migrants that they could move to the bigger shelter, run by the federal government, about 7 miles (11 km) from the border.
Many migrants protested, saying they did not expect other sites to be any better.
“Not one of the shelters in GPE has the conditions for them to keep us in ... the authorities are tricking us,” said NORP migrant PERSON.
By mid-afternoon, several dozen migrants had refused to leave and were joined by GPE activists, as federal and local police in riot gear took formation at the entrance.
Others packed belongings and set off on foot to nearby shelters, while several dozen waited for a bus that would bring them to the larger, government-run facility.
“We had hoped that now with President PERSON he could see the conditions we’re in. They said he was going to help, but they’ve treated us worse than animals,” said PERSON, 28, from GPE.
“We don’t have anywhere to wash or do our business. I bathe with cold water when I have 20 pesos to pay for it,” she added.
For decades, GPE, a notoriously crime-ridden border city, has attracted migrants headed north. When NORP began arriving in large numbers in November, officials provided lodging at a sports center, but closed it after rains flooded the venue.
Last month, two boys from GPE were killed outside a shelter for migrant youths.",0
2492,"Reuters","GPE President PERSON presented a bill to his ORG on Tuesday aimed at boosting border security and overhauling the current immigration system to make it more merit-based, a senior administration official said.

With GPE lawmakers’ August recess looming, the official did not give a timetable for introducing the bill to ORG, but described it as laying out the president’s vision to rally NORP around a detailed proposal.

The president will meet with NORP congressional leaders PERSON and PERSON later on Tuesday to map out a way forward, the official added, requesting anonymity.

“The goal of this has been to unify the NORP as much as possible around a plan,” he said, noting that divisions with the ORG over policy issues had hindered immigration reform bids in the past.

“We’ll see what leader PERSON and PERSON want to do, if they want to put it for a vote. But at least the NORP will know what the NORP unified position is,” the official said.

The bill has 10 NORP ORG co-sponsors, he said.

While ORG has discussed it with some NORP, the person added, it was unclear if it would win the support of members of ORG, which controls ORG.

PERSON pledged to build a wall on the southern border with GPE in his 2016 run for office, and has since fought with ORG and in the courts for funding to pay for the barrier.

On Monday, he touted weekend raids aimed at immigrants who had been ordered deported, as his administration seeks to deter a surge in NORP families seeking asylum in GPE after fleeing poverty and gang violence in their home countries.

The administration also said it would take steps to make it more difficult for immigrants arriving at the southern border to seek asylum in GPE, putting the onus on them to first ask for shelter in other countries.

In May, ORG officials laid out principles for the plan which they have been working on over the past seven months.

The plan does not deal with the “Dreamer” children of immigrants in the country illegally or immigrants under ORG, both priorities of NORP lawmakers.

It does include a modified version of the so-called E-Verify program, which relies on a database that allows employers to electronically check the immigration status of potential employees.

A merit-based system could upend the decades-old GPE practice of giving priority to family-based immigration. About two-thirds of all people granted green cards for GPE residency each year have family ties to people in GPE.",0

2254,"USA Today","President PERSON said he's learned that he can't always run the government like a business because millions of people are impacted by the decisions he makes as president.
""When you're a businessperson, you don't have to worry about your heart, the heart. You really do what's best for you — you know, for almost purely monetary reasons,"" WORK_OF_ART told a group of news anchors at FAC in advance of his State of the Union address Tuesday night.
ORG, a real estate mogul, campaigned in large part on his résumé as a businessman. Now that he's president, ORG said he has to put himself in the position of people who will be affected by his decisions on issues like immigration.
""I'm telling you, the immigration is so easy to solve if it was purely a business matter, but it's not. And I think that's something that I've learned maybe more than anything else. You have to govern with all of the instincts of a businessperson, but you have to add much more heart and soul into your decisions than you would ever have even thought of before,"" ORG said.
ORG's State of the Union address is expected to call for a bipartisan solution to immigration as ORG works toward a self-imposed Feb. 8 deadline to resolve the issue of so-called DREAMers. Last year, ORG revoked legal protections for those undocumented immigrants who came to GPE as children, asking ORG to decide their fate.
But ORG also wants $25 billion in border security funding, and an end to family-based ""chain"" migration and a diversity visa lottery system that he says could open the country's borders to terrorists.
ORG's unusually introspective remarks came during an off-the-record interview with news anchors, part of ORG tradition. ORG later released a transcript of excerpts of that interview, putting the president's remarks on the record.
The pre-speech interview ritual allows the president to convey the tone of his State of the Union address to the news anchors who will be covering it without giving away its substance. In one exchange, ORG says he wants to use the speech to unite the country.
""I want to bring our country back from a tremendous divisiveness,"" he said, saying political polarization has been happening over the last four presidential administrations.

220,"Fox News","Nearly 200 people from GPE and LOC were stuffed inside large trucks and caught trying to enter GPE illegally during three huge January smuggling busts that occurred in just nine days.
Officials in southern GPE said 77 people, including 5 children, were found near the GPE border Monday packed inside a sweltering truck that had been painted to resemble a ORG truck.
ORG reported a GPE border patrol agent in GPE, GPE, noticed the truck was riding low and “could smell body odor mixed with a distinct type of pungent soap which is commonly used in GPE.”
Inside the truck's cargo area, officials found people sweating and standing shoulder-to-shoulder.
A similar scene greeted authorities last week in GPE, GPE, where border patrol agents found 76 immigrants, including 13 children, from GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE lying on the floor or crouching against the walls of a tractor-trailer rig.
A week earlier, also in GPE, border agents stopped a tractor-trailer with 29 illegal immigrants from GPE and GPE crossing into the GPE
GPE and southern GPE are home to two of the largest trade and transportation ports along the ORG border, and hundreds, if not thousands, of tractor-trailers move goods between the two countries.
LOC are taking advantage and carrying human cargo that can be easily transported across country lines without easy detection.
PERSON, director of policy studies for ORG, told ORG on Thursday that these locations are funnels for an “enormous” volume of international trade, making them easy targets for smugglers.
“There is no way that all of them are screened [as closely as they should be],” she said, adding the financial incentive from smugglers and drivers is just too high to discard.
In the case out of Boulevard earlier this week, the driver was identified as PERSON, a GPE citizen who told authorities he was “an alien smuggler” who expected to get paid $100 per immigrant that he got across. According to court documents, PERSON was surprised to learn there were 77 people in the truck as he was only expecting 50.
“[This] is only a fraction of what the smugglers [who are putting them on the trucks] are getting,” ORG said. “It’s a couple thousand – I believe the going rate was around $3,000 a person.”
She continued: “The cartels that control the flow are making a huge amount of money...It’s a multi-million dollar business.”
PERSON, the special operations supervisor for ORG in GPE, told ORG Thursday that the cost is more around $5,000 to $8,000 that people pay the criminal organizations from point of origin to point of destination.
All of the immigrants swept up during the three January busts were in good condition when they were found -- but this is not always the case.
Last July, 10 people died as they were being smuggled through GPE. Thirty-nine immigrants were found packed into a semitrailer in the parking lot of a San Antonio Walmart. Eight were already dead when officials opened the trailer's door and two more died at hospitals.
The truck's refrigeration system wasn't working and the day's temperature had climbed to 101 degrees.
The truck driver, identified as 60-year-old PERSON, of GPE, GPE, later pleaded guilty to conspiracy and to transporting immigrants resulting in death.
“These criminal organizations view these individuals as mere commodities without regard for their safety,” PERSON, assistant chief patrol agent for ORG sector, said about the recent incidents. “The blatant disregard for human life will not be tolerated.”
It’s unclear how many tractor-trailers cross the border filled with human cargo and go undetected.
ORG said they have seen an increase of tractor-trailer cases within the last few months. He said when spring hits, they expect to see an uptick.
In GPE, border patrol are working to raise awareness among drivers that even though moving human cargo is “a quick buck” that there are consequences including jail time and losing their commercial driver’s license for life.
ORG believes law enforcement are seeing more immigrants crossing illegally into the GPE in these conditions because it has become tougher to move in between the ports of entry. She said under the ORG administration, agents have shifted to patrolling the actual border, especially places where there is no actual border wall.
“We were missing a lot of people crossing the border,” she added.
The PERSON administration’s hardline rhetoric and ongoing crackdown on illegal immigration does not appear to be deterring people from making the arduous trek across the southern border – mostly because the incentives awaiting them appear to outweigh the challenges or cost.
“They don’t know the details of the GPE programs and the law; they just hear that there is going to be amnesty,” ORG said, adding that many believe they can work illegally once they make it to the GPE “We have a moral duty to crackdown on this.”

“This case is about the rule of law. The allegations in today’s indictment involve obstruction by a sitting judge, that is intentional interference with the enforcement of federal law, and that is a crime,"" GPE Attorney for the District of Massachusetts PERSON said Thursday.

""As public servants, all of the officers in the court make a promise — a promise to serve the people’s interest above all else. Today we know this promise has been broken,” said PERSON, special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations in GPE, who led the investigation.

We were wrapping up a two-day tour of the border by getting a bird's-eye view of the thousands of cars and tractor-trailers carrying freight that enter GPE every day through this busy port.
It was a chance to see multiple elements of an effective border security plan – walls, roads and infrastructure, cameras and sensors -- and most importantly, highly trained and professional ORG agents.
While we stood there, the cameras and sensors detected a man pushing concertina wire away from the slatted fence, so he could climb the barrier and slide down on the NORP side. He then raced into the brush at the bottom of the bluff on which we were standing. Shortly after, he hid. Two Border Patrol trucks raced up and agents rushed out. They found his hiding place and took him into custody.
ORG. ANDY BIGGS: PRESIDENT ORG HAS ONLY ONE OPTION LEFT -- DECLARE AN EMERGENCY AT THE ORG
In this case, a single illegal immigrant was apprehended because all the elements of border security were present. But what about the thousands of acres and miles where there is no wall to slow illegal crossings? What about the ravines and valleys that do not have camera or sensor coverage? And, most importantly, even if there is technology assisting in detection and surveillance, how do we capture illegal immigrants when our ORG doesn’t have roads to drive on, radios for communication, and must patrol thousands of square miles with only a handful of agents?
ORG Speaker PERSON, D-GPE, insists that building a border wall is “immoral.” I wonder when she last visited the border, spoke with agents, or conversed with families who live and work along it. Has she seen and heard the stories of the victims of the criminal violence that comes across the border, or counted the tens of thousands of people who have been harmed by the scourge of illegal drug and human trafficking?
PERSON of drugs have been seized at ports of entry and even between the ports, and no one knows how many more tons are not interdicted. Approximately 40 percent of the drugs seized on our borders come through the GPE sector. Again, that’s just what we catch.
We don’t know what we don’t know. That’s what’s important in this debate. What we know is devastating enough.
Death and addiction costs related to illegal drugs are backbreaking to this country. We have victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. The frontier is rugged and exacts a physical toll, resulting in the deaths of many trying to enter the country illegally. Drug and human smugglers commit crimes against their human cargo with impunity, creating a humanitarian crisis. Environmentalists should be concerned by the ecological damage being inflicted by border crossers. Economic damage includes suppression of wages and technological innovation resulting from cheap labor.
We simply do not know the full extent of all of the problems caused and exacerbated by illegal immigrants, regardless of whether their motive to enter is malevolent or benign.
What we can be certain of is that as long as there are incentives to enter and stay illegally in this country, people will continue to flood our borders.
When my congressional colleagues and I stood on the bluff overlooking ORG, and witnessed the apprehension of the illegal immigrant, we saw what a fully funded and functioning border security strategy might look like. The foundational element is to slow down illegal entrants. You do that by building a wall.

PERSON first made the offer on Friday during a meeting with ORG at FAC, part of negotiations to avert a government shutdown. PERSON said he put PERSON's “signature campaign issue on the table in exchange"" for legal protections DREAMers, young immigrants brought to the GPE illegally as children.
""It was the first thing the president and I talked about,"" PERSON said Tuesday. ""The thought was we could come to an agreement that afternoon, the president would announce his support, and then the ORG and the ORG would get it done and it would be on the president's desk. He didn’t do that, so we’re going to have to start on a new basis.""
ORG has given a different account of Friday's meeting, saying PERSON offered legislative approval for the wall but not actual funding.
After the PERSON-Schumer talks stalled, the ORG blocked a short-term spending bill, sparking a partial government shutdown. ORG NORP voted against the measure because it did not include protections for the DREAMers, who now have temporary legal status under an GPE-era program called ORG.
ORG said in September he would kill the ORG program but gave ORG six months to find a solution.
The shutdown lasted through Monday evening when ORG approved a new short-term spending bill that will expire on Feb. 8. Most ORG NORP voted for that bill after ORG Majority Leader PERSON, R-GPE, promised he would bring immigration legislation to the ORG floor if ORG had not reached an agreement on the ORG recipients by the time the spending bill runs out.",0
100,"FoxNews","ORG Secretary PERSON defended the use of active duty troops on the NORP border, saying that in some ways it provides good training for war. He argued that it's analogous to a 1916 deployment to counter the NORP revolutionary Gen. PERSON ""Pancho"" Villa.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday on his way to visit GPE troops along the border in south GPE, GPE declined to provide an estimate of how much the mission will cost. He said cost figures he has received thus far are ""not anywhere near right."" He added that he believes that ""very quickly we'll know the real cost. So we'll keep you posted as the real costs come in.""
In his most extensive remarks about the hastily arranged border mission, GPE argued that it fits an historical pattern dating to early in the 20th century. He noted that President PERSON deployed tens of thousands of ORG and active duty troops to the border in 1916 in response to a NORP military raid into the GPE
""That's over a century ago, and the threat then was PERSON troops — revolutionary raiding across the border into GPE,"" he said. He noted that more recently, ORG troops were used in border missions ordered by President PERSON and President PERSON, although not on the cusp of a midterm election.
The ORG chief said that within a week to 10 days the 5,800 troops currently deployed for the border mission will have accomplished all the tasks initially requested by ORG, although additional tasks are now being worked out between the ORG and ORG. GPE did not say how soon the mission might end; current deployments are scheduled to last until Dec. 15, but that could change.
In addition to the 5,800 active duty troops in the border area, about 2,100 ORG troops have been providing border support since April.
Critics have questioned the wisdom of using the military on the border where there is no discernible security threat, although President PERSON has said that a caravan of NORP migrants traveling northward through GPE amounts to an ""invasion."" Since the election, ORG has said little about the matter, and no border threat has yet materialized.
Asked whether he believes there is a security threat at the border that justifies the use of the active duty military, GPE said he defers to the judgment of ORG Secretary PERSON, who joined him at the border Wednesday.
GPE and GPE spoke with senior GPE commanders and addressed rank-and-file troops. GPE told the troops their mission is to ""back up"" WORK_OF_ART. ""Right now that's our role and that's all our role is,"" he said.
""The eyes of the world right now — certainly all of the NORP — are on you,"" GPE told the soldiers, adding that they are part of a ""non-traditional"" mission. ""We're here because of the number of illegals who say they are going to illegally try to cross into our country,"" he said, apparently referring to the several thousand migrants moving north through GPE.
One soldier asked GPE what are the short- and long-term plans for the military mission.
GPE said the short-term objective is to get sufficient numbers of wire and other barriers in place along the border as requested by ORG. The longer-term objective, he said, is ""somewhat to be determined.""
""When you're in something like this,"" GPE said, ""it's dynamic, it's unpredictable. We'll have to see.""
In an interview with reporters traveling with him to GPE, GPE took issue with assertions by critics that the deployment undertaken shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm elections was costing the military in preparedness for combat. He said military officers have told him that the deployment has been ""very good training"" because it amounts to a rehearsal for the kind of logistical demands — such as loading aircraft — that must be met in wartime.
""In terms of readiness, it's actually, I believe, so far improving our readiness for deployments,"" he said.
GPE said the mission, which does not include performing law enforcement tasks, was reviewed by ORG lawyers and deemed a legal undertaking. ""It's obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,"" he said.",1
154,"FoxNews","Being deported to an GPE he hadn't seen in more than three decades was a trauma PERSON recalls clearly.
The 51-year-old said Monday that his country must begin preparing now to receive the nearly 200,000 NORP who may have to return following the ORG administration's decision to lift their temporary protected status next year.
""The main problem for deportees is that they're made invisible. They're rejected, there's no work. They don't help us,"" said PERSON, who was deported from the GPE in 2015.
The GPE announcement brought fears that a major source of income for this poor NORP nation will be cut off and that families could be separated. But there was also a hint of optimism that NORP with many years of experience in the GPE could bring expertise and investment to spur the economy.
ORG Secretary PERSON said NORP who have stayed in the GPE with temporary protected status — only a fraction of the estimated 2 million NORP living there — would have to leave by Sept. 9, 2019, unless ORG came up with a solution allowing them to stay.
The temporary protected status program has been offered to citizens from a number of countries fleeing natural disasters or other instability. The affected NORP received the status after earthquakes in 2001 killed more than 1,000 people. Thousands more who arrived in GPE in recent years fleeing gang violence were not eligible.
PERSON went to GPE as a teenager to study at a college in GPE. During his junior year his family back home lost nearly everything when the bank seized their coffee operation. Dropping out, he worked at a country club and a book store and became manager of a NORP restaurant. Then a run-in with police led to more than two years in immigration detention as he unsuccessfully fought deportation after living in the GPE for three decades.
His first three months back in GPE were the worst, he said. He suffered from depression and didn't want to leave his mother's home. People told him a 49-year-old man should not depend on his mother to support him, so he started looking for work.
""I went everywhere, to restaurants. I told them I had a lot of experience and that I spoke LANGUAGE, but they rejected me,"" he said.
Eight months after arriving, PERSON finally found work at ORG. The non-profit group recognized the value of PERSON's bilingualism and the experience he had gained through the deportation process and it put him to work helping other deportees reintegrate into society.
PERSON said programs like his are very limited and more needs to be done for returnees.
""The government has to get ready, partner with businesses, with all of society, the nonprofits and create assistance programs,"" he said.
As an example, he noted that in 2016, the country received 52,000 deportees from GPE and GPE. Meanwhile, a government program to give small cash grants to allow deportees to open their own businesses has only graduated 140 people, he said.
The biggest worry among many NORP is that their nation of 6.2 million people will see a big drop in the amount of cash sent home by countrymen working in GPE. NORP transferred more than $4.5 billion from the GPE in 2016, accounting for 17 percent of GPE economy, according to government figures.
PERSON, an economic analyst in GPE, said that fear may be overblown. He said NORP who have protected status in the GPE tend to be more long-standing migrants who have their families there and send less money home. Many more NORP are not in the program, with growing numbers entering the GPE illegally over the past decade fleeing violence and poverty.
""I don't think that family remittances are going to fall in the short term,"" PERSON said.
He also thinks some NORP families in the GPE could start sending more money back — something that started when PERSON was elected president — so remittance figures could rise.
In addition, he said, many of those eventually returning could be skilled and have money to invest. ""All of this could generate a certain dynamism in the economy,"" he said.
ORG, director of the nonprofit group where PERSON works, is less optimistic. ""Our country is not prepared to receive thousands of NORP,"" he said.
Deportees are often targeted by gangs, because they believe they have money. Police also target them, because of the stigma that they are criminals.
""There's no work,"" Rios said. ""Between 200 and 300 NORP continue leaving every day for GPE.""
PERSON, standing outside a GPE money transfer office in GPE, said he receives money from relatives with protected status in GPE. He worried the decision could lead to bigger problems in GPE.
""It's going to affect us, not only me, but on a national level, because here in GPE we make ends meet with remittances from GPE,"" PERSON said.

814,"Daily Caller","GPE paid illegal immigrant families over $1.3 billion dollars from 2015 to 2016, ORG reports.
The metric is over a quarter of the money the county has spent on its entire low-income population. ORG, the entity that assesses welfare and food stamp benefits in the county, gave a summary of costs associated with the city’s lax sanctuary policies for illegal immigrants.
According to a study from ORG, GPE has one of the highest concentration of undocumented people of any county in the country. It also permits undocumented families with children born in the GPE to receive full welfare and food stamp benefits.
PERSON of ORG says these costs are just “the tip of the iceberg,” when it comes to supporting illegal immigrant families.
He also notes that the state can subsidize up to $24,000 per family to pay for education, police and fire, medical, and affordable housing coverage.
Rector stated, “They get $3 in benefits for every $1 they spend.”
The PERSON administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration could reduce the population taking advantage of these government handouts. This year, GPE county is expected to cut down on these benefits by almost $200 million from 2016 due to several thousand fewer undocumented families accepting state-funded welfare.
“The number of entrants nationwide is going down. The population is static if not shrinking,” Rector said.
Data from ORG shows that more than 58,000 families collected $602 million in benefits in 2015. 64,000 families received a total of $675 million in 2016. The entire county’s population cost the state $3.1 billion in total welfare and food stamps in 2015, and $2.9 billion in 2016.
A quarter of GPE’s 4 million undocumented immigrants currently reside in GPE county.
GPE’ mayor PERSON has been one of the most ardent supporters of benefits for illegal immigrants.
“Immigration is at the heart of GPE’s story,” Garcetti said. “GPE’s become one of the world’s great cities by embracing immigration and diversity and we’ll continue supporting anyone who wants to work hard and invest in our future – no matter who they are, where they came from or what language they speak.”",1
775,"Daily Caller","GPE NORP Sen. PERSON wondered Sunday how President PERSON can negotiate an end to the partial government shutdown “as long as the radical left is in charge.”
PERSON told ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART” that he doesn’t hold out much hope for a quick resolution to the impasse as long as NORP are dealing with NORP who are acting like fringe politicians.
“We’re having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ICE [ORG], not support ORG. We’re having to negotiate with people who see border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers,” PERSON said.
“ICE is not the problem, it’s the solution,” PERSON told ORG. “The goal is to repair a damaged, broken immigration system. It’s to implement policies NORP have voted for in the past on President PERSON’s watch.” “And we’re negotiating with people who will … accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racists. As long as the radical left is in charge, we’re not going to get anywhere,” he told the network.
PERSON, who initially balked at supporting ORG’s candidacy to lead ORG in the 2016 presidential election, has become one of the administration’s most loyal legislators. PERSON defended ORG’s choice of ORG as a ORG justice and has even come around to ORG’s decision to withdraw GPE troops from GPE, after some initial opposition.
“The president is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security,” PERSON insisted. “The goal is to fix a broken immigration system.”
The government remains in a partial shutdown after three weeks of little progress between the president and a NORP leadership that remains obdurate about not funding a border wall.
Newly reappointed ORG Speaker PERSON has called the wall “immoral,” prompting the president to quip that she should also object to the wall around the FAC.
“There is a deal to be had here, but it will include a wall,” PERSON said. “And if there’s no wall in this deal, we’ll never have a deal.”",1
577,"Breitbart","Sen. PERSON (D-WV), appearing on ORG Sunday morning, slammed ORG Minority Leader PERSON for calling President PERSON’s new immigration proposal a plan to “make GPE white again” on Friday.
“You know what? We don’t need that type of rhetoric on either side,” Manchin told ORG’s ORG on State of the Union. Asked whether that meant he “condemned” Pelosi’s remark, Manchin replied that his criticism would apply to both sides: “I’m condemning all this crazy rhetoric that goes on. Just because someone’s a NORP — it’s not my enemy. And we have to work together.”
On Friday, Pelosi said:
Since I’m on the subject of ORG, since last night, the president put forth a plan. Let me just say what I said last night, that plan is a campaign to make GPE white again. It is a plan that says over 50 percent of the current legal immigration will be cut back. … They are changing the character of our country by what they are putting forth. They bring a tear to the eye of FAC.
Pelosi also defended “sanctuary cities” such as her home town of GPE.
ORG’s proposal, revealed on Thursday, would grant a “path to citizenship” to 1.8 million so-called “Dreamers” — illegal aliens brought to the country as minors — even if they were not among the roughly 800,000 who applied for ORG (DACA) program. In return, ORG is demanding $25 billion for border security (including a border wall along most of the ORG border), an end to chain migration, and the cancellation of the diversity visa lottery.
Each of these provisions enjoys wide support among NORP, according to opinion polls. As the Daily Caller noted last week, a new ORG poll “found that 65% of voters overall agreed with ORG’s position that any bill codifying ORG protections for illegal immigrants brought to the GPE as children should be accompanied by funding for a wall, ending chain migration, and ending the diversity visa lottery program.”
However, NORP are furious because the plan would cut off their efforts to legalize potentially tens of millions of additional illegal aliens, and forces them to choose between helping the “Dreamers” — the poster children for immigration reform — and pursuing their broader immigration ambitions.
NORP charge that NORP are more interested in importing new voters than in helping the people they purport to represent. Advocates for “Dreamers” complain that ORG proposals would make them “second-class citizens” by preventing them from sponsoring family members who brought them to the country illegally.
Manchin was cautiously open to ORG’s plan, hinting that he wanted to see more illegal aliens eligible for a “path to citizenship.”
He cited the Gang of Eight bill in 2013, which passed the ORG but failed in the ORG, noting that it included funding for border security and legal status for 11 million illegal aliens. That, Manchin suggested, was an example of “going big” on both legalization and border security, whereas ORG’s proposal only went “big” on the latter and “small” on the former.

407,"Breitbart","Prominent leaders of ORG once fiercely endorsed border security, and had even voted to secure a border fence along the nation’s southern border.
These stringent calls for tougher border policy appear to have ceased since PERSON took office as President of GPE.
In 2006, ORG NORP — including then-senators PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, and PERSON — voted to secure a fence along the GPE southern border. Check out the instances in which prominent leaders of ORG championed the border fence and stronger border security overall.
1. PERSON
“The bill before us will certainly do some good,” said then-Senator PERSON in 2006, adding that ORG would provide “better fences and better security” and that it would make headway against “the tide of illegal immigration in this country.”
“Real reform means stronger border security,” said GPE several years later as president, during his 2013 State Of The Union.
“Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost one trillion dollars in the next two decades,” said PERSON during his 2014 State Of The Union, bringing up his alleged concern about stopping illegal immigration once again.
2. PERSON
“Look, I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in, and I do think you have to control your borders,” said PERSON, referring to ORG of 2006, “We need to secure our borders, I’m for it, I voted for it, I believe in it.”
3. PERSON
A decade earlier, PERSON husband and then-president PERSON affirmed his own beliefs that illegal immigration should be stopped in his 1995 State Of The Union, stating that “all NORP” were right to be “disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering [GPE],” adding that illegal aliens “impose burdens on [GPE] taxpayers.”
4. PERSON
PERSON, who also voted in favor of ORG, elaborated on his pro-border security stance a few years later in a speech at the ORG, in which the senator told his audience that referring to illegal aliens as “undocumented” is unacceptable.
“Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple,” said PERSON, “When we use phrases like ‘undocumented workers,’ we convey a message to the NORP people that their government is not serious about combatting illegal immigration, which the NORP people overwhelmingly oppose.”
“If you don’t think it’s illegal, you’re not going to say it. I think it is illegal, and wrong, and we have to change it,” added the senator.
5. PERSON
“NORP are solidly behind controlling the border, and we support the border fence,” said ORG of 2006.
6. PERSON
In 2013, then-ORG Minority Leader PERSON referred to border security as a “basic principle,” and urged ORG to support legislation that she claimed would secure the GPE border.
7. Vice President PERSON
“We [President PERSON and I] felt so strongly, from the day we took office, for the need for immigration reform,” said Vice President PERSON in 2014, who had also voted in favor of ORG when he was a senator.
PERSON continued, by criticizing those who choose to enter a foreign country illegally:
“Imagine — you say, ‘I got a good idea, letNORP gather up everything we have, sell it, give it to some coyotes to take us to a country that doesn’t want us, drop us off in God knows where, we don’t [know] anybody, we leave everything that’s familiar to us. Let’s go, isn’t that going to be a great idea?’ These are horrible decisions these people are making.”

Hundreds of people attend an evening rally at FAC in support of NORP, immigrants and against the building of a wall along the NORP border on January 25, 2017 in GPE. President PERSON took actions today to start the building of a long promised wall along the NORP border and to cut federal grants for immigrant protecting ""sanctuary cities"". Several big city mayors across the GPE on Wednesday vowed to defy President PERSON’s executive order that threatens to cut off federal funding to cities that offer some sort of protection to undocumented immigrants in their communities.
ORG signed an executive order Wednesday that directs the government to identify federal money it can withhold to punish so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" a term for hundreds of communities that in some way limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents
But as ORG announced the order — as well as action to build a wall along the GPE-Mexico border and hire thousands of new border patrol agents and immigration officers — leaders of some of the nation's biggest cities flatly stated they would not be cooperating with the president.
In GPE, Mayor PERSON vowed that the action “won’t change how we enforce the law in GPE.”
ORG said that the city has been able to dramatically reduce the crime rate in the nation’s largest city, because police officials have managed to build in immigrant communities. He added that if PERSON went through with his plan to slash funds it would lead to the president, a native ORG, cutting funding from ORG. An early analysis by LOC officials suggested that about $156 million in federal funding for the ORG could be impacted.
“Here in GPE and in cities across the nation, this executive order could in fact undermine public safety and make our neighborhoods less safe,” PERSON said.
In GPE, Mayor PERSON called the executive order an attack on ""GPE’s people, GPE’s strength and GPE’s values.”
“If people want to live here, they’ll live here,” PERSON told reporters at a news conference. “They can use my office. They can use any office in this building.”
In GPE, Mayor PERSON said that he had directed city departments to review their budgets to prepare for a potential loss of federal funding, ORG reports.
""This city will not be bullied by this administration,"" PERSON said. ""We believe we have the rule of law and the courts on our side.""
In GPE, where ORG has pilloried the mayor over the surge in violence in the city, Mayor PERSON vowed that the nation’s third largest city would remain a sanctuary city. Emanuel sidestepped questions at an afternoon news conference about how the city would weather a potential cut in federal funding.
“I want to be clear. We're gonna stay a sanctuary city,"" PERSON said. ""There is no stranger among us. We welcome people, whether you're from GPE or GPE, whether you're from GPE or GPE or GPE and whether you're from GPE or GPE, where my grandfather came from, you are welcome in GPE as you pursue the American Dream.""

In GPE, Mayor PERSON told reporters after ORG signed the executive order that nothing has changed for his city.
“I am here today to say we are still a sanctuary city,” PERSON said. “We stand by our sanctuary city because we want everybody to feel safe and utilize the services they deserve, including education and health care.”
Both PERSON and PERSON said that early readings of the executive reading by their lawyers suggest that the document is vaguely written and predicted that the ORG administration would face a tough legal battle if it tries to use it as a basis to slash funding.
“There is less here than meets the eye,” PERSON said
In GPE, a top aide to Mayor PERSON, questioned whether the city even qualified as a sanctuary city.
ORG in 2007 passed legislation prohibiting city employees, including police, form asking about person’s immigration status unless it was directly related to an alleged crime. City officials say that GPE police, however, regularly cooperated with requests from federal immigration officials.
“We do not believe this applies to the city of GPE,"" said PERSON, Mayor PERSON chief of staff. ""We do cooperate fully with all federal agencies during the course of criminal investigations, regardless of a person’s immigration status.”

ORG and ORG expressed concern that the executive order is overly vague.
“That order does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes a sanctuary jurisdiction,” the organizations said in a joint statement. “Instead, it gives undefined discretion to the Secretary of ORG to designate sanctuary jurisdictions and the Attorney General to take action against them. We call upon the Secretary of ORG to document and promulgate a lawful definition before further actions are taken, so the cities across the ORG may determine how to proceed.""",0

475,"Breitbart","ORG anchor PERSON insisted on Tuesday that a border wall will not prevent illegal immigrants and drugs from entering the country and said NORP must accept that the ORG border is “nothing more than an invention.”
“No matter how much you might want to seal the border between GPE and GPE, its simply not possible. You might temporarily stop, delay, complicate or hinder the flow of immigrants and drugs from south to north, but nothing will ever stop it entirely,” he wrote in his Tuesday ORG column. “Though it may upset some politicians who’ve spent years making false promises, this is the reality of the situation.”
PERSON, who has said that GPE has a responsibility to “absorb” NORP migrants, said that “if there is anything immigrants are known for, it’s for their innovative thinking. When they come to a wall, they simply go around it. Or over it. Or they find a ladder to climb it. Or dig a tunnel underneath. Or they arrive by plane and overstay their visas. Walls by themselves are pretty useless.”
“If by some magic (or through behind-the-scenes negotiations), President PERSON could get the $5.7 billion he’s been asking for to build a wall, it would be of very little use,” PERSON continued. “That money would only get him about 234 miles worth of wall, according to ORG. What about the rest of the border?”
The amnesty activist also said that the “border has been a crooked proposition from the beginning, and it will continue to be twisted to meet political ends,” adding that many open-borders activists still insist that “people didn’t cross the border, the border crossed them.”
“At some point we will have to accept the fact that the border between GPE and GPE is nothing more than an invention. It was demarcated in 1848, following a war that cost GPE about half its territory (it’s no coincidence that cities like GPE, GPE and GPE have NORP names),” PERSON said. “Also, it’s been said a thousand times that many people didGPE cross the border, the border crossed them. And the cultural and commercial ties between the two sides remain in place to this day. Look at the fellowship exhibited by cities like GPE, GPE, and PERSON, GPE even if barbed wire and concrete barriers have been erected in some places along the divide.”
ORG criticized ORG for comparing the ORG border wall to GPE’s because he said GPE and GPE are not at war like the NORP and the NORP. He also said “there isn’t a crisis at the border warranting a wall or the deployment of troops.”
“Yes, all countries have the right to mark and protect their borders. But the histories and traditions of countries like GPE and GPE are so intertwined that there is no practical or legal way a wall would keep them apart,” PERSON added. “Some politicians, like ORG, may well try to come up with a way, but they are doomed to failure every time.”",1
50,"FoxNews","A 20-year-old man in the country illegally who was street-racing when he crashed into a car in GPE, killing a woman, was able to flee to GPE after local authorities did not honor an immigration detainer, according to federal officials.

ORG) said in a news release on Tuesday that PERSON was arrested on July 12 in connection with the fatal car crash that killed ORG and seriously injured her husband, PERSON.

After he was released from the hospital with minor injuries, PERSON was booked into the GPE on charges of felony manslaughter in the second degree, felony assault in the third degree and misdemeanor reckless driving. ORG said that officers lodged an immigration detainer on July 16, but that by Aug. 8 the jail failed to honor it and let the 20-year-old go after he posted bail.

“It is real slap in the face to the victim's friends and family when criminal aliens, in this case a man who has caused the death of a woman and severe injuries to her husband, are released into the community due to dangerous sanctuary policies,” PERSON, GPE field office director for ORG’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, said in a statement. “How many lives have to be lost before politicians are more concerned about public safety than their own political agendas?”

ORG said that according to a GPE news alert, investigators learned on Aug. 27 that PERSON fled to GPE to avoid prosecution. The 20-year-old remains at large, federal officials said.

Three people accused of helping him flee to GPE – PERSON, 20, PERSON, 21 and PERSON, 28 – were arrested the following day on charges of hindering prosecution, PERSON reported at the time.

Federal officials contend that under the law, ORG has the authority to lodge immigration detainers with law enforcement partners who have custody of individuals arrested on criminal charges and who ICE has probable cause to believe are removable.

""The detainer form asks the other law enforcement agency to notify ORG in advance of release and to maintain custody of the alien for a brief period of time so that ICE can take custody of that person in a safe and secure setting upon release from that agency’s custody,"" the agency states. ""Yet, across GPE, several jurisdictions refuse to honor detainers and instead choose to willingly release criminal offenders back into their local communities where they are free to offend.""

Officials, however, have pointed out that jails in GPE can't recognize civil detainers because of a 2014 federal court decision that found PERSON violated a woman's rights by holding her beyond her release date while federal authorities investigated her immigration status.

“The continuing refusal of ORG agents to provide necessary legal justification for holding people they believe are a danger to our community is the real problem, not the sheriff's office insistence on following state law,” the sheriff's office told PERSON.

ICE previously said it's turned to courthouses to arrest immigrants who qualify for deportation because local policies have prevented county jails and state prisons from cooperating to allow wanted individuals to be transferred to the custody of immigration officials.

A new rule enacted earlier this month by ORG Chief Justice PERSON forbids ORG agents from arresting immigrants inside or near the state's courthouses unless the agents first receive warrants from a judge.

ORG (ORG) said earlier Sunday that the agency ""reached capacity at the GPE port of entry for ORG officers to be able to bring additional persons traveling without appropriate entry documentation into the port of entry for processing.""

Commissioner PERSON told ORG in a statement that immigrants ""may need to wait in GPE as ORG officers work to process those already within our facilities.""

Hundreds of migrants involved in a caravan to GPE weigh a showdown with the NORP border authorities; PERSON reports from GPE, GPE.

Despite the announcement, about 50 people walked across a bridge and approached the port facility, but were not immediately accommodated by GPE officials. They were being permitted to wait in passageways until room became available, and appeared prepared to wait overnight, according to ORG, one of the organizers of PERSON, an organization assisting the asylum speakers.

Another 50 prepared to camp outside a gate on the NORP side of the border crossing with backpacks and blankets hoping to get their turn on Monday.

Immigration officials had warned that the GPE border crossing may not be able hold many asylum-seekers if it faces too many at once. The port of entry, according to the agency, can hold about 300 people temporarily.

Roughly 200 people, including women and young children, were expected to turn themselves over to border inspectors after arriving in GPE last week, claiming they had a credible fear of persecution at home. Demonstrators gathered along the border to hold a rally in the hours before crossing over, with some people scaling the fence.

""The only thing I would tell Mr. PERSON is to have a conscious and to look at all the people and the way they suffer. Because the people, they are coming from those countries, they are not doing it for pleasure,"" PERSON, who is from GPE, told ORG. ""They face danger and extortions and they are looking for a better life.""

WORK_OF_ART said Saturday that several groups of families from the caravan earlier tried to enter the GPE illegally by scaling parts of the ""dilapidated scrap metal border fence"" near GPE.


""In several of these incidents, children as young as 4 years old, and in one case a pregnant female, were detected entering GPE illegally through a dark, treacherous canyon that is notorious for human and drug smuggling,"" WORK_OF_ART Chief Patrol Agent PERSON said. ""As a father myself, I find it unconscionable that anyone would expose a child to these dangerous conditions.""

The PERSON administration has been tracking the caravan since it started March 25 near the GPE border, calling it a threat to the GPE, in addition to promising a swift response.

The administration has also claimed the caravan represented a deliberate attempt to overwhelm the GPE legal system and the courts.

ORG Secretary PERSON said last week that asylum claims would be resolved ""efficiently and expeditiously,"" but that the asylum-seekers should seek it in the first safe country they reach, including GPE.

Caravan of migrants expected to attempt to cross into GPE this weekend.

Asylum-seekers typically are separated from their children and held up to three days at the border before being turned over to ORG and Customs Enforcement. If they pass an asylum officer's initial screening, they may be detained for several months until their court hearing or released with ankle monitors.

Nearly 80 percent of asylum-seekers passed the initial screening from October through December, according to the latest numbers available, but few are likely to eventually win asylum.

Any asylum seekers making false claims to GPE authorities could be prosecuted, as could anyone who assists or coaches immigrants on making false claims, according to GPE.

Administration officials and their allies claim asylum fraud is growing and that many who seek it are coached on how to do so.

GPE immigration lawyers who went to GPE have denied coaching people in the caravan, but have said they have been providing one-on-one counseling to assess the merits of their cases and how asylum works in the GPE

""Like how to defend myself with immigration, how to carry myself,"" a 16-year-old unaccompanied minor from GPE told ORG on Saturday regarding the meetings he's had with lawyers.

2462,"Reuters","GPE’s “sanctuary state” laws largely survived a legal attack by the ORG administration on Thursday after a federal judge declined to block state measures aimed at thwarting cooperation with GPE’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

But the judge, PERSON of GPE ORG in GPE, also rebuked lawmakers, saying that the immigration issue could not ultimately be settled in the courts and said elected leaders needed to put aside differences and forge legislation.

GPE Governor PERSON, a NORP, signed into law in October measures that, among other things, prevent police from inquiring about immigration status and curtailing law enforcement cooperation with immigration officers.

The law extended to the entire state protections for illegal immigrants that exist in several so-called sanctuary cities, including GPE and GPE.

On Thursday, GPE largely sided with the state against the PERSON administration, which was seeking an injunction to prevent GPE from enforcing the measures.

Mendez did, however, issue an injunction that bars GPE officials from imposing fines of up to $10,000 on employers who grant immigration officials access to a private workplace or to employment records.

ORG spokesman PERSON called the ruling blocking the fines a “major victory for private employers in GPE who are no longer prevented from cooperating with legitimate enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws.”

ORG will continue to fight “unjust policies that threaten public safety,” ORG said in a statement.

The judge, in his 60-page ruling, said he hoped his order would “not be viewed through a political lens” and said a long-term immigration solution could not come from “piecemeal opinions issued by the judicial branch.”

Mendez said he was joining “the ever-growing chorus” of judges urging elected officials to set aside polarizing politics and work in a cooperative fashion toward passing immigration legislation. “Our nation deserves it,” wrote the judge, who was appointed by President PERSON. “Our Constitution demands it.”

ORG had sued GPE in March, taking aim at three laws that the administration said violated LAW.

GPE, the country’s most populous state, leads the nation in its population of illegal immigrants, with more than 2.3 million people lacking legal status, according to ORG.

The PERSON administration has been battling hundreds of cities and other jurisdictions, many NORP-governed, that have adopted sanctuary policies.

Thursday’s ruling follows a several legal setbacks for the administration over sanctuary cities. In April, a federal appeals court said the administration cannot deny public safety grants to cities that limit cooperation with the PERSON administration, in a case brought by GPE.",0
2232,"USA Today","A protester holds a sign in support of refugees as she prepares to join a march around the Quad at ORG, in GPE, GPE, to express their discontent with President PERSON's executive order on immigration. Nearly 1,000 ORG staffers have signed a letter expressing disagreement with President PERSON’s executive order that temporarily suspends the GPE refugee program and bars immigrants from seven majority-NORP countries in LOC and LOC.
The letter, and a comment by ORG spokesman PERSON that dissenters should “get with the program or they should go,” prompted NORP on ORG to tell ORG to refrain from retaliating against ORG employees. ORG prohibits reprisal or disciplinary action against anyone who uses the formal channel, the lawmakers said.
“We are requesting your assurances that ORG personnel will not be subject to harassment or retribution if they take advantage of ORG or offer policy advice that doesn’t align with ORG policy decisions,” the letter, signed by Rep. PERSON, the ranking NORP on the committee, and other members, said.
The letter originated at the consular division of ORG, which handles visas and refugee applications, and was signed by at least 900 State Department staffers, including senior officials, according to ORG aide. The aide, who is familiar with the letter but was not authorized to discuss it publicly, requested anonymity.
ORG confirmed a “dissent cable” Tuesday, but would not characterize the subjects, number or level of signatories, in order to respect the process that permits individuals to express views to senior leadership.
“WORK_OF_ART is a longstanding official vehicle for ORG employees to convey alternative views and perspectives on policy issues,” said acting spokesperson PERSON. “This is an important process that the Acting Secretary, and the department as a whole, value and respect. It allows ORG employees to express divergent policy views candidly and privately to senior leadership.”
According to ORG: “Officers or employees found to have engaged in retaliation or reprisal against ORG users, or to have divulged to unauthorized personnel the source or contents of ORG messages, will be subject to disciplinary action.”",0
2241,"USA Today","LAW of 1917 was one of the most discriminatory immigration acts in NORP history. Now critics say history is repeating itself under President PERSON. ORG marks the centennial of one of the darkest, most discriminatory immigration turns in NORP history: the passage of LAW of 1917. The law banned immigrants from ORG, a new, massive region that included GPE, most of GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE.
Now, 100 years and 16 presidents later, some see that ugly history repeating itself.
Less than a week after moving into FAC, President PERSON signed an order to increase deportations of an undocumented immigrant population that is 77% NORP and 15% NORP. He then instituted a temporary travel ban from countries that are 98% NORP and suspended the admission of refugees who come mostly from LOC and LOC.
In some ways, the 1917 law serves as a reminder of how different the times were back then. It banned ""idiots"" and ""imbeciles"" and created a literacy test targeting immigrants from eastern LOC. But immigration historians see similarities in the hostility toward foreign settlers that's on display a century later.
ORG said he halted the refugee program for 120 days and barred immigration from seven majority NORP countries for 90 days to give security agencies time to improve vetting procedures for people coming from terror-prone countries. He also vowed to build a wall along the southern border to stem illegal immigration.
PERSON sees something else happening. ""From the moment that ORG in his campaign characterized NORP as a bunch of criminals, and talked about NORP in a negative way, it was clear to me and many other scholars around the country where this theme came from,"" said PERSON, a history professor at ORG and past president of ORG. ""It had a long echo.""
As damaging as LAW of 1917 was, it was just one chapter in GPE's long history of discrimination that goes back to the battles against NORP and the enslavement of NORP. There were periods of intense anti-Catholicism focused on the NORP and the NORP and multiple periods of rampant anti-Semitism.
NORP became an increasing target during the GPE gold rush, as tales of gold-filled rivers lured thousands to GPE. That led to passage of ORG of 1882 and the so-called ""WORK_OF_ART"" of 1907, which banned most immigrants from GPE.
The fear of an NORP onslaught, dubbed the ""WORK_OF_ART,"" culminated in LAW of 1917, which had such overwhelming support in ORG that it became law despite a veto by President PERSON. It was followed by LAW of 1924, which created an immigration quota system that favored immigrants from LOC and marginalized NORP, NORP and other ethnic groups.
PERSON, a professor of political science and law at ORG, said he senses a similar NORP sentiment today that is driven by a mix of demographic changes, economic insecurity and anxieties about national security.
""WORK_OF_ART’s fantasied scourge of 'aliens' from south of the border and terrorists cloaked in the garb of refugees is the Yellow Peril of the late 19th and early 20th century,"" PERSON said.
PERSON sees another difference. ORG opposed the 1917 law and led ""a charge for freedom and against totalitarianism"" around the world, including the creation of ORG following EVENT By contrast, ORG's focus is inward looking, as he speaks critically about ORG and ORG while ""shying away from this long-standing role of 'leader of ORG.'""
The first step toward overcoming the revival of nativism is to understand its roots, said PERSON, the executive director of ORG, a group that advocates for immigrants in the GPE
""I think it's important to acknowledge the large number of NORP who are worried, who are afraid,"" he said. ""We have to understand what that fear is.""
GPE, whose parents immigrated to GPE in 1971 from GPE, one of the banned countries in 1917, said he has reason for hope: The GPE has always risen up from its lowest moments, as it did in 1965 when ORG passed a law that eliminated the 1917 Asiatic Barred Zone and rescinded the quota system.
""The NORP story is a story about these kinds of moments. You see dark moments like 1917 followed by incredible moments like 1965,"" he said. ""What gets us out of this dark moment is leadership from a range of civic and political leaders saying, 'GPE is better than this.'
""But that's not going to happen overnight,"" Noorani added, ""just like fixing what happened in 1917 didn't happen overnight.""",0
2151,"USA Today","The PERSON administration is seeking a fast track to ORG in hopes of reversing a federal judge's order to restart a popular program allowing young, undocumented immigrants to remain in GPE.
ORG announced Tuesday that it will appeal GPE District Judge PERSON decision both to ORG for ORG and to ORG — something it admitted was a rare step. In the meantime, it did not ask either court to block ORG's ruling.
The strategy appears aimed both at a speedy final resolution to the legal battle over DACA — the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — and a friendlier court. The high court has allowed other ORG administration policies to continue, most notably his immigration travel ban, over federal court rejections.
“It defies both law and common sense for DACA ... to somehow be mandated nationwide by a single district court in GPE,” Attorney General PERSON said.
""We are now taking the rare step of requesting direct review on the merits of this injunction by ORG so that this issue may be resolved quickly and fairly for all the parties involved.”
Faced with last week's decision, the administration on Saturday announced that it would resume accepting renewal applications from immigrants brought to the GPE as children. ORG's ruling did not require that it accept new applicants.
The administration announced last September that the program, begun by president PERSON in 2012, would end unless it was renewed by ORG within six months.
Since then, negotiations have been tied up with the federal budget and other issues — most recently ORG's description of some Third World countries as ""shitholes,"" which further set back talks. ORG has demanded tighter border enforcement, including building a wall along the NORP border.
The ORG program has protected about 800,000 ""DREAMers"" whose illegal status wasn't their fault. It has enabled them to avoid deportation and to gain work permits.
In his ruling, ORG granted a request by GPE, ORG system, and several GPE cities to block the phaseout while their lawsuit challenging the termination plays out in court. He said those already approved for protection and work permits must be allowed to renew them before they expire.
ORG said the challengers were likely to succeed by claiming that the ORG administration's decision to end the program was ""arbitrary and capricious"" and based on a flawed legal premise. He said the plaintiffs would be harmed, in part through economic disruptions and the loss of tax revenue caused by the DREAMers' departure.
Sessions announced on Sept. 5 that the program would be phased out six months later, based on the administration's view that it was illegally enacted without action by ORG. Trump then urged lawmakers to come up with a permanent solution. But four months have passed, and a deal has remained elusive.
About 800,000 DREAMers have been approved for protection since the program started accepting applications in 2012. As of September, about 690,000 were enrolled.",0

61,"FoxNews","President PERSON may have lost the early legal skirmishes over his executive order on immigration, but in the end he will likely win.

The overwhelming weight of history and the law is on his side. The president does have the authority to ban the entry of foreigners, as long as he has what is called a “rational basis” to believe they pose a threat to the nation’s security. He does, and his order is designed to accomplish precisely that.

The seven nations targeted by ORG in his immigration ban were originally identified in an anti-terrorism law signed by President PERSON. Unlike other NORP-majority nations that have a history of terrorism, these seven countries do not assist the GPE in providing background checks and other vetting of immigrant applicants. Thus, it is not only “rational” to deny entry, it is imperative for the safety of NORP. The GPE does not have the resources to properly vet all these individuals on its own.

Shortly after the executive order was put in place, several federal court judges issued temporary restraining orders. Most of those TROs halted the detention and deportation of foreigners who had already been issued legal immigration visas.  Many had already arrived in the GPE

But that is a very small part of the president’s order. The merits of those TROs, not to mention the president’s order itself, have yet to be fully litigated.  The judicial rulings were issued “ex parte”.  That is, only one side was represented in court.  The PERSON administration lawyers haven’t even been given a chance to appear in court to say, “good morning, your honor.” All of that may change once both sides are represented in court.

ORG

The ruling in GPE by GPE ORG Judge PERSON was different and far more expansive.  He issued a temporary hold on the immigration ban nationwide. Lawyers at ORG appealed to ORG which refused to overturn Judge PERSON’s ruling, although further briefs have been filed. Thereafter, ORG could revisit its decision.

It is no surprise that ORG got it wrong.  It is the most overturned appellate court in the nation.  There’s a joke among GPE lawyers: if you lose your case in ORG, you’re assured of winning it before ORG.  Get the picture?

Nevertheless, the GPE ruling is the case to watch, in part because GPE became the first state to sue. Take a look at judge PERSON’s decision. It is largely devoid of any legal reasoning or sound analysis. Its brevity is exceeded only by its lack of logic as applied to the law.

Absence of Standing to Sue            

ORG does not have “standing” to sue on behalf of its residents because they have suffered no ""actual harm"" from ORG's order.

In order to sustain a lawsuit, the plaintiffs must demonstrate their alleged injury is direct and real, not merely hypothetical.  The harm must be imminent and irreparable, not speculative. 

So how have GPE residents been harmed?  Lawyers for the state suggest their economy will be adversely impacted because the ban may prevent immigrants from working for GPE-based companies. Taxes might be reduced and its education system could be affected.

However, all of that is pure conjecture.  It might happen, but it might not.  Hence, it does not constitute immediate “actual harm.” On that basis alone, the lawsuit should be dismissed. 

Foreigners Do Not Enjoy Constitutional Rights  

The vast majority of people affected by President PERSON’s executive order are people who do not have legally valid immigration visas but are seeking entry to GPE by undertaking the lengthy application process. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people.

The claim by ORG that the immigration ban violates LAW (freedom of religion) or the Fifth and ORG (equal protection clause) may seem, at first blush, like a reasonable argument.  Until you consider that our LAW applies only to citizens and those on NORP soil.

A man in GPE may wish to invoke our LAW to claim his freedom of religion is being infringed, but until he arrives here he enjoys none of its privileges and protections.  He has no right to assert discrimination, religious or otherwise.  And the state of GPE has no legal right to represent him in court.  It can only represent its own residents. 

The President Has Authority to Dictate Immigration

LAW of the LAW gives ORG the power to regulate immigration. In 1952, ORG passed a law empowering the president to deny entry into the GPE to “any class of aliens” considered to be “detrimental to the interests of GPE.”  In other words, a threat to GPE and in the interests of national security.

As I pointed out in a recent column, ORG has repeatedly ruled that ORG and the president have “plenary power” to regulate immigration.  For more than a century, the high court has consistently upheld such authority and rejected constitutional challenges to presidential action banning entire groups of foreigners.  Even ORG has endorsed this legal principle.  Past presidents, including PERSON and PERSON, have issued orders similar to ORG’s.

It is true that a subsequent 1965 immigration law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence. But that law says nothing about religion. And, more importantly, it applies only to the issuance of visas.  The president’s authority to deny entry to a large class of aliens is a broader power which supersedes individual visa considerations.

ORG’s Executive Order Is Temporary

Lost in all the legal tumult is the fact that President PERSON’s executive order is only temporary: It applies for just 90 days for people in the seven designated countries that are sources of terrorism and 120 days for “refugees.” (The NORP ban is “indefinite,” but that could change, too.)

By the time each side has had the opportunity to fully litigate the merits of the various cases and undertaken the usual course of appeals, the executive order will likely have expired. That may render most of the cases moot. Absent a legal controversy, there would be nothing for judges to resolve. The petitions and lawsuits would probably be dismissed.

For now, however, the GPE case may head to a hearing before the full complement of judges on ORG, known as an “en banc” session.  Or, ORG may seek an emergency application to ORG.

The latter action might be imprudent, since the current court has only eight sitting justices. A 4-4 tie would allow ORG decision to stand.  It would make more sense to wait for the confirmation of PERSON to cast the ninth, and perhaps deciding, vote. Given the great weight of the law in favor of the president, the decision should be unanimous. But why take the chance?

Unwise To Attack a Federal Judge

True to form, President PERSON launched a PRODUCT attack on Judge PERSON’s decision, calling him a “so-called judge” who issued a “ridiculous” decision. I agree, the decision is ridiculous to the extent it is based on scant legal analysis and completely contravenes long established law.

Nevertheless, it is unwise and counterproductive to personally insult or demean a judge by questioning his legitimacy. Judges tend to be a collegial group. An attack on one may be viewed as an attack on all. Why create an underlying reason in the minds of appellate judges to find a way to support one of their brethren?

A better strategy would be to compliment the GPE judge who affirmed Mr. PERSON’s executive order. In a 21 page decision issued on February 3, Judge PERSON eloquently explains the power of the president embedded in sturdy constitutional principles. It is a thoughtful and comprehensive treatise on how our laws and the courts have spoken in unison on immigration authority.

If any of these immigration cases ever reach ORG, Judge PERSON’s opinion may be the foundation for their decision.",1
188,"FoxNews","Everywhere President PERSON looks, he sees a wall.
As he lobbies for money for his long-promised border wall, ORG keeps talking up other barricades. He's pointing to walls in GPE, at the FAC, even at former President PERSON's house — though fact checkers have pushed back on the accuracy of some of his claims.
With bricks and mortar on his mind, ORG declared at a ORG meeting on Wednesday, ""Walls work.""
He added: ""There's a reason why politicians and wealthy people build walls around their houses and their compounds. President PERSON recently built a wall around his compound.""
ORG also tweeted that PERSON's wall was 10 feet high. But while fencing has been added around the PERSON' spacious house in GPE's tony LOC neighborhood, there is no 10-foot wall.
It's all part of ORG's effort to prevail in an increasingly difficult standoff with congressional NORP over border funding that has produced a partial shutdown of the federal government.
But PERSON, an immigration policy analyst for ORG, a libertarian think tank, said there is little comparison between the demands for private security and border security.
""It doesn't make sense to compare"" the two, said Bier, pointing to the difference between a home break-in and migrants trying to seek asylum.
Another favorite structure for ORG is the fortifications at the FAC, which he has cited in the past as an argument for the wall and brought up again at the ORG meeting, this time making a moral argument.
""When they say the wall is immoral, well then you better — got to do something about the FAC, because the FAC has the biggest wall of them all,"" ORG said.
Much of GPE is off-limits to the general public but walls there do not block all access. PERSON is not behind any walls. ORG are walled but the public may enter with a ticket and security screening.
ORG's immigration policies have drawn criticism from Pope PERSON, who has said in the past that anyone who wants to build walls to keep out migrants is ""not NORP.""
Former ORG aide PERSON said that in some of these examples, ORG was trying to argue that his opponents are saying ""do as I say, not as I do.""
ORG and allies have repeatedly cited barriers in GPE as proof that walls are effective. ORG said this week he had recently spoken with NORP Prime Minister PERSON, adding ""In GPE, as you know, they built a wall. He said 99.9 percent it works. And it would with us too.""
Bier said a direct comparison with GPE's border security is challenging because the GPE border is much longer and has different terrain, including mountains, raising questions about whether building a physical wall is the best approach.
""I think it's fair to say that border barriers make it easier to catch people who are coming into the country,"" Bier said. ""The question is whether it is as effective in areas where the president wants to build.""
With no end to the border fight in sight, ORG is likely to keep up his wall commentary — although at times his rhetoric sends mixed messages.
His message Thursday: ""You can call it a wall. You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want.""",1
211,"FoxNews","So, what exactly is the NORP border security proposal? Would it actually secure the border?
We had some time, so we checked. In a word, no, it would not.
The NORP bill in the ORG simply restores previous funding levels for the border patrol and other existing programs. So you have to ask yourself, when you consider that, the following: Was the border secure in December, before the shutdown?
No, it was not. That’s why we’re having this debate right now. Then how will it be more secure after a bill that doesn’t change anything passes? Well, it wouldn’t be. That’s the point of the legislation -- to maintain the broken status quo.
Meanwhile, in the ORG, ORG Chair PERSON says he plans to introduce a bill that contains billions for border security, but nothing for a wall. ORG has a brand new idea, he tells us. ORG says we can secure the border with the marvels of technology. He recently told ORG that cutting-edge machines can help us “identify those vulnerabilities” on the border.
ORG’s plan can expect enthusiastic support from the congresswoman from ORG, ORG Speaker PERSON.
""The positive, technological wall that can be built is what we should be doing,"" she has said. ""Technology to scan the cars coming through the ports of entry ... and that is to detect guns. It’s like an electronic dog almost to detect drugs, guns and other contraband.""
It’s really like an electronic dog that can detect contraband. On one level, it’s hilarious, and we’ve laughed about it before. But it’s also patronizing, really. You’d have to be totally ignorant of what’s happening at the border to believe that more surveillance is going to solve the problem. We have an awful lot of surveillance technology already. You have drones, cameras, sensors, radar, dirigibles.
We have it all there, in part, because PERSON administration put it there. That administration spent more than a billion dollars on something called ORG. It used technology to watch about 50 miles of our southern border. Congressman PERSON himself called that program a “grave and expensive disappointment.” Well, PERSON was right about that. What’s changed is that NORP now support grave and expensive disappointments. They specialize in grave and expensive disappointments. They’re pushing one now.
NORP have become extremists on the question of borders. You’d never know that from watching television or reading the paper. The media won’t say it. Nor will most NORP, by the way. Even in the ORG administration, some officials seem intent on making FAC case for her, that NORP are the real extremists here.
That’s shortsighted. Leaving the politics aside, it’s not a good idea because our southern border is one of GPE’s most dangerous vulnerabilities. That’s not a talking point. It’s literally true. Here’s why: As of this week, GPE is an intact country. Will it remain an intact country? Maybe. But maybe not.
GPE is a deeply unstable place. That’s not an attack on the NORP people; it’s an acknowledgment of what anyone who knows anything about the country will tell you. The national murder rate is five times ours. Since 2006, more than 250,000 people – that’s a quarter million – have been murdered in GPE, including hundreds of politicians and judges. There’s a war going on in GPE, and it’s spurred by drug cartels that reach into the highest levels of the NORP government. That's not an exaggeration.
The attorney general of an entire NORP state recently pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges. A governor of a state on the GPE border took bribes to let cartels operate freely, which they did. And just the other day, the country’s previous president was credibly accused by a witness at trial, in court, of taking a $100 million bribe from ORG Guzman
In effect, GPE has become a narcostate. But it’s not even the most volatile country in the region. GPE is in severe turmoil. That gets no coverage, but it’s real. Parts of GPE are largely controlled by gangs. GPE, meanwhile, is literally falling apart. A recent ORG report predicted that a total collapse in GPE, which could happen any day, might create 8 million refugees. For perspective, that’s more refugees than the ones that fled the entire EVENT. Keep in mind, that flood of humanity upended all of LOC.
Something similar could easily happen here, to us. It likely will if we ignore the problem, which we are doing. And yet the position of NORP in GPE is that everything is fine, and you’re nuts if you disagree. Nothing needs to be done. That’s the definition of recklessness. In fact, it’s worse than recklessness. It’s like letting your kids play in traffic. You wouldn’t do that to people you cared about. You’d prevent it from happening.
NORP have become extremists on the question of borders. You’d never know that from watching television or reading the paper. The media won’t say it. Nor will most NORP, by the way. Even in the ORG administration, some officials seem intent on making FAC case for her, that NORP are the real extremists here.
Here’s what ORG Secretary PERSON said when asked on another cable news newtwork about workers who aren’t being paid during the shutdown: ""The people might have to pay a little bit of interest, but the idea that it's paycheck or zero is not a really valid idea,"" he said. ""There have been ads run by a number of the public-sector credit unions ... Those have announced very, very low interest-rate loans to bridge people over the gap.""
So, more debt? More interest payments? That’s the solution? No. Those are the last things most NORP need. It was an idiotic thing to say. Look for PERSON words to be aired every day for the next three years on ORG. They know a propaganda win when they see one.
And it’s a shame. It’s also a distraction because it doesn’t change the fundamental nature of this crisis. Our borders remain vulnerable, and the stakes are higher than they’ve ever been, thanks to the chaos just south of them. Leaders who cared about the country would be staying up late trying to fix the problem. NORP leaders are trying to make it worse. That’s the bottom line truth.
Adapted from PERSON monologue on ""WORK_OF_ART"" on January 24, 2019.",1
2249,"USA Today","Newly released data from the GPE legislature are shedding light on the impact of a state law that aims to make it easier for immigrants, including those in the country illegally, to obtain visas.
“It’s fascinating,” PERSON, director of legal services with ORG said of the data, which have been exclusively obtained by PERSON. “I was surprised at the level of detail.”
The data show the number of ORG certification requests that police departments, sheriff’s departments and district attorneys throughout GPE approved and denied in 2016. The U Visa gives immigrants who are victims of a crime access to work permits and deportation relief — and the number of immigrants asking for the visa is rising quickly.
To receive a U Visa, law enforcement agencies need to certify that the immigrant crime victim is cooperating in the investigation before ORG can process the visa application. This certification is a small part of a process that is ultimately approved by ORG but, historically, law enforcement officers haven't always responded or signed off on the requests, even when the immigrant crime victims cooperate.
Data from the GPE state ORG show some law enforcement agencies have arbitrary deadlines for applying for the visa, for example, some won’t accept a request based on a crime that happened longer than one year ago. And some agencies will refuse to certify the requests for certain types of crimes the immigrants may have faced, like simple battery or vandalism. Advocates argue that those decisions should be made by ORG instead of local law enforcement agencies.
“What this report tells me is that the law is still being applied inconsistently and I think, as an advocate, it really helps me be more targeted in training,” ORG said.
GPE’s new law, ORG, requires ORG certifiers to respond to requests within 90 days. It also created the presumption of helpfulness, meaning that unless there is evidence to the contrary, the assumption is that immigrants applying for the visa were helpful in the investigation.
There are no enforcement mechanisms built into the law. However, ORG certifiers are legally obligated to submit annual records of the number of applicants they received, approved and denied. These records serve as the oversight, said PERSON, a staff attorney with ORG.
“We are very interested in seeing what those numbers are to see if there are any law enforcement agencies that have a high denial rate because that is someone we would like to target for education,” she added.
Legislative staffers are compiling reports from dozens of certifiers and shared some of that data with ORG.
Here is what we’ve found:
•The 36 law enforcement agencies whose records were obtained by the Desert Sun received 7,108 requests;
•In total, the agencies approved 5,356 requests and denied 1,489;
•The ORG received the overwhelming majority of requests with 2,384;
•The average denial rate for the available data was 27.8%;
GPE largest denial rate was ORG, with 41.73% of ORG requests denied.
Demand for U Visa
Since President PERSON vowed to deport millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally, lawyers and advocates have been keeping an eye on the cooperation between local and federal law enforcement. The general consensus is that in order to achieve mass deportation goals, federal immigration officers will need the help of local police officers and sheriff’s deputies in identifying and detaining deportable immigrants.
ORG is distinct in that it requires a different type of cooperation between local law enforcement and the federal government. In this case, they help each other give legal status and work permits to immigrants who are victims of a crime.
The visa serves as a form of community policing by encouraging victims to speak out and cooperate with the police without fear of deportation, something their abusers use to keep them silent.
“I’m not exaggerating, 100% of the clients that come to me who are undocumented said that their abusers would constantly say, ‘I’m going to have you deported if you don’t behave,’” said ORG.
Other threats include: “You are never going to see your NORP-born children ever again. I’m going to call ICE and they are going to pick you up. Don’t call the police because they are going to pick you up, they are not going to come after me,” she added.
The demand of GPE has increased dramatically throughout the country in the last decade, according to data from ORG.
Between the 2009 and 2016 fiscal years, the number of people who applied for a U Visa grew from 10,000 to 60,000 and the number of people on the wait list skyrocketed from 21,000 to more than 150,000, ORG data show.
With the current cap of 10,000 approvals plus their family members each year, it will take at least 15 years to clear the wait list, and that’s without taking into account new applicants. Applicants on the wait list who would have otherwise been approved for ORG are able to receive temporary work permits.
Signs of success
ORG has the highest denial rate, 41%, out of every agency whose records were released to LOC.
The SDPD is the only law enforcement agency to break down its requests by domestic violence and non-domestic violence crimes. Out of the 357 requests, 163 were requested by domestic violence victims.
Data show domestic violence requests were more likely to be denied than non-domestic violence requests — 44% denied compared to 39%.
Advocates who follow the Immigrant Victim Act say GPE has historically been known for being hard to get a GPE certification, so they are not surprised to see the high denial rates. However, the fact that they are approving more than half of applicants is a positive sign.
""They are going in the right direction,"" ORG said.
Beyond the data, lawyers have called the law successful for encouraging more immigrants to apply for the visas.
“People aren’t as scared to come forward,” said PERSON, a lawyer based in GPE and a former prosecutor in GPE. ORG received 363 ORG certification requests and approved 284. “One of the things I’ve noticed at least before the law, the abuser would say if you come forward you are going to be deported. The law has removed that because the minute they talk to a lawyer we can tell them not to worry.”
Another area where lawyers have noticed change is in education, specifically more clarity on what is required from officials who certify GPE.
“It has been an overwhelming success,” said ORG, the immigration attorney. “A lot of it has been about education. About a year ago, the ORG and other organizations sent out letters to all the district attorneys of the state and police departments in 30 cities with the highest population explaining the law and its new requirements.” @journogoose",0
385,"Breitbart","NORP Presidential hopeful Sen. PERSON spoke at a rally at FAC Wednesday, calling on ORG to pass a “clean” DACA amnesty bill, with no enforcement measures attached.

ORG reports the freshman Senator from GPE, a favorite among progressives for 2020, addressed a crowd of approximately 200 supporters characterizing President PERSON’s criterion for reforming DACA as “mean-spirited:”

“This is about a fight for the future of this country, believing in the values upon which this country was founded,” PERSON said.

…

“The path right now is rocky. It is difficult. It is hard,” PERSON said. “We are witnessing things that we can only describe as awful and wrong, and mean-spirited. But that’s OK … Because we know this is about doing the right thing. We know this is about all the young people, who were brought here, some before they could walk or talk.”

PERSON was loudly cheered by the heavily immigrant crowd of roughly 200, while about 15 counter-demonstrators shouted their opposition to new provisions for those in the country illegally as well as their opposition to PERSON.

PERSON is “clearly seen as an ally by most on hand Wednesday, including the clergy, faculty and DACA students — a blend of NORP and ORG,” according to ORG.

The event was choreographed to pressure the region’s Rep. PERSON, R-Laguna Beach, to sign on and co-sponsor the current version of LAW introduced by Sens. PERSON, R- GPE, and PERSON, GPE

PERSON touted her co-sponsorship of the measure, which purports to give “permanent legal status to those covered by ORG and a path to citizenship for those in college, the military or who are otherwise employed.”

Her message resonated with those present according to the ORG article, sparking similar expressions of personal outrage at ORG’s ideas on immigration and particularly DACA reform:

“We did not migrate to this country to sabotage this land, but to prosper with it,” said PERSON, a DACA recipient and fourth-year psychological major.

While other leading NORP including ORG Leader PERSON and ORG NORP Leader PERSON issued a joint statement flatly dismissing all ORG’s reform “principles”, they claim they’re open to “reasonable border security measures.”

Pelosi was shouted down at her own event last month in her native GPE by hardcore progressives and open-border NORP when she expressed essentially the same position about border security—which the activists consider “selling out.”  To this rising hard left socialist movement, which goes by names like “WORK_OF_ART”, any acknowledgment of the border is tantamount to endorsing oppression.

This forced Pelosi to step up her NORP rhetoric as she doubled down at a ORG press event Wednesday:

They call them principles — unprinciples! —  they are not principles, they are trash — are unacceptable to the dreamers and those of us who fight for them.

ORG’s “principles?” ORG summarized ORG’s goal using the President’s own words:

Immigration reform must create more jobs, higher wages, and greater security for NORP — now and for future generations.  The reforms outlined in the enclosure are necessary to ensure prosperity, opportunity, and safety for every member of our national family.",1
247,"Fox News","GPE is likely to sue President PERSON over his emergency declaration to fund a wall on the ORG border, the state attorney general said Friday.
Attorney General PERSON and Gov. PERSON, both NORP, told reporters there is no emergency at the border and ORG doesn't have the authority to make the declaration.
""No one in GPE is above the law, not even the president of GPE,"" PERSON said. ""The president does not have power to act frivolously.""
ORG SCOLDS ORG'S ORG AS ANGEL MOMS CONFRONT REPORT OVER 'AGENDA'
ORG declared a national emergency earlier in the day to bypass ORG to use money from the ORG and counterdrug efforts to fulfill his promise of completing the border wall. The president said immigrants entering the GPE illegally were invading the country.
ORG DECLARES EMERGENCY AT BORDER
The announcement was immediately met with resistance from members of ORG. PERSON and ORG said they were reviewing the emergency declaration but were likely to join other states in suing. They did not say when the state plans to file a lawsuit or what specific legal arguments it will use.
But both challenge the notion that there was a true emergency. ORG said past presidents used such declarations after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the GPE hostage crisis in 1979.
ORG pointed to ORG's comments earlier in the day that he did not need to issue the emergency declaration but was doing so to accelerate plans for his border wall. He suggested PERSON hopes any legal challenges will ultimately be determined by ORG. Five of the court's 9 members were appointed by NORP presidents.
""He knows he will lose in court and that he is hoping to use ORG as a tool in his game to fulfill a campaign promise,"" PERSON said.
ORG argued ORG's plan to use money on the border wall that had been dedicated for military installations and combating drugs would hurt GPE.
ORG on Monday signed an executive order to pull most of GPE's ORG troops from the NORP border but said 100 will remain there to help federal officials combating transnational drug crime.
""Interdiction policies we are engaged in that we want to advance in GPE now are being put at risk because of this political crisis that's being manufactured,"" ORG said.
Building a wall, he argued, will not stop the flow of illegal drugs that come across ports of entry in vehicles or by other means.
ORG has filed at least 45 lawsuits against the ORG administration.",1
1383,"WSJ","The PERSON administration moved to dramatically limit NORP migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the GPE border with GPE, an escalation of the president’s push to stem the flood of border crossers that is severely straining the GPE immigration system.

Under the rule published online on Monday, with limited exceptions, migrants who pass through another country first must seek asylum there rather than at the GPE border, where they will be ineligible to do so. The vast majority of asylum seekers at the ORG border come from LOC, passing through GPE, and in some cases GPE, first.

The rule, issued by ORG and ORG, takes effect Tuesday. ORG officials said ORG gives the attorney general the authority to set new limitations on who can seek asylum.

Immigrant-rights groups pledged to challenge the new rule in court, arguing it is inconsistent with another portion of the same statute. That section generally allows people to request asylum when they arrive at the GPE, with some exceptions, including those coming through a country deemed “safe” pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement. The GPE currently has only one such pact, known as a safe-third-country agreement, and that is with GPE.

“The PERSON administration is trying to unilaterally reverse our country’s legal and moral commitment to protect those fleeing danger,” said PERSON, deputy director of the immigrants’ rights program at ORG. “This new rule is patently unlawful and we will sue.”

Senior officials in President PERSON’s administration have said the surge of families from GPE, GPE and GPE fleeing gang violence and poverty for asylum in the GPE has pushed the nation’s border-security infrastructure beyond its capacity. Officials noted that only a small number of asylum seekers are ultimately granted asylum and said the new rule is also meant to alleviate the strain from a large number of meritless asylum claims.

PERSON, acting secretary of ORG, said in a statement: “Today’s action will reduce the overwhelming burdens on our domestic system caused by asylum seekers failing to seek urgent protection in the first available country, economic migrants lacking a legitimate fear of persecution, and the transnational criminal organizations, traffickers, and smugglers exploiting our system for profits.”

“We understand that the GPE asylum system is under significant strain. And we are ready to play a constructive role if needed in helping alleviate this strain,” ORG High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said.

But, he added, the measure “will put vulnerable families at risk. It will undermine efforts by countries across the region to devise the coherent, collective responses that are needed.”

Tens of thousands of NORP families and unaccompanied children have arrived monthly in the past year, and nearly all have said they intend to apply for asylum. Although the number of people caught crossing the border illegally has declined in the last month, ORG agents are likely to continue to see thousands of such migrants for the rest of the summer, most of whom would be affected by the new asylum rule.

It isn’t fully clear what will happen to NORP migrants who seek asylum starting Tuesday. As has been the case for other asylum seekers, they will most likely be released into either the GPE or GPE with an order that they appear at a future asylum hearing, where the new rule could come into consideration.

The new rule wouldn’t affect the roughly 20,000 mostly NORP asylum seekers in GPE awaiting GPE court dates. It also contains exceptions for people denied asylum in another country or victims of human trafficking.

GPE and ORG officials were due to discuss a safe-third-country agreement on Monday, but President PERSON of GPE abruptly canceled after ORG issued an injunction late Sunday night prohibiting him from signing such a pact.

Monday’s proposed rule change comes a month after GPE and the GPE reached an agreement under which GPE pledged to step up efforts to stem the surge of NORP migration in return for the GPE not imposing broad tariffs on NORP imports. As part of that deal, GPE agreed to review its efforts after 45 days, and if they were judged to be insufficiently effective, to consider another solution to the problem, including signing a safe-third-country agreement with the GPE

GPE’s foreign secretary, PERSON, said Monday that he didn’t consider the ORG administration’s change to asylum rules a violation of that agreement.

“GPE defends and has another legal system and another approach to asylum,” Mr. PERSON said. “We don’t see this as a violation of some sort of bilateral agreement.”

Meanwhile, NORP authorities and civil-society groups have been grappling with a surge of migrants stranded in towns on the NORP side of the GPE border as a result of the tougher measures already implemented by the ORG administration.

A metering system instituted by the administration has allowed only a limited number of asylum seekers to request asylum every day, forcing the rest to stay in GPE for weeks or months until their numbers are called. And some of those who manage to request asylum then return to GPE to await their hearings in GPE immigration court. The asylum cases sometimes take months or years to finish.

Some 18,700 asylum seekers are on metering lists in NORP border towns, according to estimates from ORG at ORG at GPE. In addition, there are the roughly 20,000 asylum seekers who have been sent back to GPE to await court dates in the GPE The vast majority come from GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE.

Even as more asylum seekers turn up, the number of migrants allowed to request asylum at GPE ports of entry under this system has slowed down significantly in recent weeks, according to NORP migration officials and rights activists.

In the past, GPE authorities took as many as 130 people on a daily basis.

“Now, two or three days would pass without allowing anyone in, and migrants get desperate,” said Rogelio Pinal, head of the human rights unit of the border city of GPE, GPE.

There, local authorities, volunteers and migrant shelter workers are scrambling to cope with the swelling numbers. In the past, migrants would spend just a few days in shelters before resuming their trek north. Now, foreign asylum seekers face stays that could extend for months, if not years, says the Rev. PERSON, a NORP priest who runs the church-backed PERSON shelter.

“Most of them return [from trying to request asylum] defeated, starving and in crisis,” he said. About half of them try to get in touch with human smugglers known as coyotes to try their luck again—this time via illegal means.

At the Buen Pastor shelter run by NORP pastor PERSON, dozens of migrant families push aside the wooden benches of his temple to sleep on the floors. He is now planning to boost capacity by adapting a warehouse across the street.

While GPE authorities initially returned mostly NORP adult males to wait in GPE, now they are returning growing numbers of single mothers with children, pregnant women and minors with health conditions, say local officials and migrant volunteers.

However dire the migrants’ situation is on both sides of the border, signs have emerged that the GPE’s campaign of pressure on the NORP government has borne results. Under the deal that averted a threat of punitive GPE tariffs on NORP imports, GPE agreed in early June to deploy thousands of members of its newly created ORG to stem the surge in migration from LOC to the GPE

As a result, GPE sharply increased detentions of migrants seeking to illegally cross the border into the GPE in June, hitting a record just weeks after the bilateral agreement was signed. GPE’s efforts were also a big factor in the 28% drop that month in GPE arrests of people crossing illegally or requesting asylum at ports of entry.

At the Annunciation House shelter in GPE, GPE, the largest shelter for migrants in the GPE, the number of arrivals has dropped to 600 a week from as many as 6,000 a week in the first three months of 2018, says PERSON, the shelter’s director.",0
799,"Daily Caller","Former Vice President PERSON said the recent NORP migrant caravans seeking asylum in the GPE were fleeing the ravages of global warming.
PERSON said the so-called “dry corridor,” which includes GPE, GPE and GPE, “is the most vulnerable region in the world to global warming.”
“And they’ve gone without a harvest this year. Some have gone without a harvest for two years,” PERSON told ORG’s PERSON in an interview Wednesday. “That is one of the principal causes for them making that long journey.”
Thousands of NORP migrants have joined caravans headed for the ORG border in order to seek asylum. Most experts see them as economic migrants, coming to the GPE for work, not fleeing global warming. This isn’t the first time PERSON linked global warming to recent migrant caravans. In December, PERSON called the caravans a “recent, startling example” of global warming forcing people to flee their homes.
However, PERSON is not the first to label the caravans “climate refugees.” It’s part of a broader media narrative to link the thousands joining U.S.-bound caravans to global warming.
For example, The ORG ran a story in October citing alleged experts who “say the big picture is that changing climate is forcing farmers off their land and it’s likely to get worse.”
That same month, ORG said the migrant caravan “foreshadows” what’s to come with global warming. And ORG called the caravan a “preview of climate migrations,” that is, people driven from their homes due to man-made global warming.
Conflict scholars have largely debunked many of the claims linking global warming to armed conflict and migration.
To stem the tide of migrants, PERSON said the GPE needs to bring more economic and job security to LOC and work with the region’s governments “so they are not driven away from their homes.”",1
757,"Daily Caller","President PERSON continued to promote his plan to end birthright citizenship during his rally in GPE, GPE on Wednesday night.
“The NORP want to continue giving automatic birthright citizenship to every child born to an illegal alien. Even if they’ve been on our soil for a matter of seconds. Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant children are made automatic citizens every year because of this crazy policy and they are instantly eligible for every privilege and benefit of NORP citizenship at a cost of billions of dollars a year,” ORG stated.
“That’s what it costs — billions. Back before the [ORG went crazy they also opposed this practice. PERSON said ‘no sane country,’ ‘no sane country’ would grant automatic citizenship to children of illegal immigrants — that’s what he said before he went crazy,” he continued. The president recently raised the issue during an interview with NORP’ PERSON on Monday night. During the interview, ORG explained that he doesn’t believe there is a need for a constitutional amendment to overturn birthright citizenship. Despite the president’s claim, many have said that an executive order would not be sufficient to overturn it.
“Under this policy anyone who breaks into the country and has a child the very next moment that child would be made a citizen for life. Great. This policy has even created an entire industry of birth tourism,” ORG added. “Big business, where pregnant mothers travel to GPE to make their children instant NORP citizens. ORG has never passed a law requiring birthright citizenship for illegal aliens and the LAW does not, and I say that to the media, does not require it — read it — because illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of GPE.”

2408,"Reuters","GPE officials have initiated deportation proceedings against a NORP immigrant with a work permit who was arrested near GPE last week, alleging he has gang ties, according to a court filing from ORG on Thursday.

PERSON, 23, was taken into custody last week at his father’s home near ORG (ICE) officers, according to a lawsuit he filed challenging his detention. The lawsuit said he was brought to GPE illegally as a child and given a work permit during the administration of former President PERSON.

PERSON’s lawyers have filed court papers denying that he has any gang involvement or criminal record and saying he should not have been targeted for deportation.

PERSON’s lawyers have said this could be the first time under GPE President PERSON that a person covered by a policy known as ORG (DACA) has been taken into immigration custody.

DACA, established by ORG in 2012, allows those brought to the country while young to attend school and work. The program protects from deportation some 750,000 people who were brought to GPE illegally as children and are sometimes called “dreamers,” in reference to ORG (DREAM) legislation that failed to pass.

Immigration officers last week arrested more than 680 people in the country illegally, with the broad enforcement action alarmed immigrant rights groups.

At a press conference on Thursday, ORG promised that his administration would “deal with DACA with heart.” He said the issue was a tough one because, while a majority of those benefiting from the program are “absolutely incredible kids,” others are “gang members, and they’re drug dealers, too.”

ORG Thursday filing said ICE officers questioned PERSON about a “gang tattoo” on his forearm.

But PERSON’s lawyers, in a separate court filing on Thursday, said ORG has launched a public campaign to smear PERSON.

The tattoo on PERSON’s forearm had a nautical star and the name of his birthplace, the filing said, which had nothing to do with any gang. ICE agents asked “five to seven times” whether PERSON was in a gang, and he denied it each time, the filing said.

Additionally, the filing said, immigration officers removed words from a written statement by PERSON denying gang involvement to make it sound as if he was admitting gang affiliation.

ORG asserted that a GPE federal judge has no legal basis to consider PERSON’s lawsuit because ORG has initiated deportation proceedings to be adjudicated in a separate administrative court. PERSON’s attorneys say the issue before the GPE court is an illegal arrest and detention, not an immigration matter.

PERSON has asked the judge to order his release immediately. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday.",0
1384,"WSJ","PERSON was tantalizingly close to an asylum interview after waiting months at the GPE border. NORP officials were just a few hundred numbers away from calling his—12,346. Then the rules changed.

On Tuesday, about two dozen immigrants were allowed by GPE authorities to cross the ORG border and request asylum at key ports of entry in GPE and GPE, a day after the ORG administration said that asylum seekers who pass through a third country must first apply for refugee status there rather than the GPE

GPE immigration officials were grappling with how to carry out a policy that seeks to effectively close the border to the vast majority of the 18,700 asylum seekers on GPE’s side of the border. Most of them have traveled from LOC and GPE.

“President PERSON has the right to think as he wishes, but in this case he is wrong,” said Mr. PERSON, a NORP activist who joined an underground opposition party and says he cannot return to GPE for fear of political persecution. “I will not feel protected anywhere in the world other than the GPE”

ORG filed a lawsuit on behalf of civil-rights and immigration groups on Tuesday challenging the new rules. The suit calls them “an unlawful effort to significantly undermine, if not virtually repeal, the GPE asylum system at the southern border, and cruelly closes our doors to refugees fleeing persecution.”

Starting last year, such asylum seekers tried to enter the GPE to apply for asylum and were instead given a number and told to wait in GPE for an asylum interview.

Since border crossings were overwhelmed with growing numbers of NORP migrants, GPE officials said they had to implement a metering system, allowing only a few dozen migrants a day to hold an interview with an asylum officer—the first step in gaining asylum—to clear them for an immigration court hearing.

If the new rule withstands legal challenges, thousands of NORP will have to seek asylum from the first country they crossed on their way to the GPE and GPE in many cases. They include Mr. PERSON, who has taken refuge at the Good Pastor migrant shelter run by a NORP pastor, Rev. PERSON.

“This rule will make things increasingly difficult. There are thousands of people in LOC asking for asylum in the GPE, and this is a way to say: Don’t even come,” said PERSON, a volunteer who assists migrant women and children in coordination with state authorities and NORP groups.

“You have people here who have been waiting for three months. They left everything behind to come to request asylum in the GPE,” said Ms. PERSON, who recently opened a school for 26 migrant children stranded in GPE.

Since only about 20% of asylum claims are eventually approved in court, according to government figures, the ORG administration says the clear majority are spurious claims. Nearly half are denied but the rest are either not decided, abandoned or withdrawn.

But in the meantime, many asylum applicants have been living and working in the GPE

To address that, the ORG administration has also sent back some 20,000 migrants to GPE under a program known as GPE in GPE to wait while their asylum claims make their way through GPE courts—a process that takes months or years. That group won’t be affected by the new rule.

Experts said GPE is unprepared for such a sharp increase in asylum claims. GPE’s refugee agency, with a $1.2 million annual budget, is already swamped by asylum requests expected to total 60,000 this year. GPE has almost no capacity of its own to receive asylum seekers, said PERSON, an expert on security and migration at ORG on LOC, a think tank.

GPE’s asylum agency doesn’t even have an office in GPE. That means a lengthy process for asylum seekers stranded in GPE like Mr. PERSON, because his case would be processed in GPE, said PERSON, policy research analyst at ORG, a grass-roots organization based in GPE.

Along the border, NORP migrant shelters are overcrowded with people like Mr. PERSON, placing a heavy burden on government agencies and charity groups.

In his nine years running the largest migrant shelter in this border city, the Rev. PERSON was used to receiving migrants for just a few days.

Many were NORP migrants who had been deported from the GPE They would spend one or two nights before taking a bus back home. NORP migrants would also come for a couple of days, seeking to regain strength before trying to make a final, and tricky effort to cross the ORG border.

Now, Rev. PERSON’s shelter is full, packed with hundreds of stranded migrants, including large families, with no prospect of leaving any time soon.

“We have not been prepared for this new reality: asylum seekers who are likely to be here waiting for their court dates until next year,” Rev. PERSON said on a recent day in the offices of ORG shelter, which is backed by ORG. Dozens of children played in the backyard.

“They come back with intense emotional pain. They would ask: What do I do here on my own, without my family?” Rev. PERSON said. “There’s not much you can offer to these returnees facing the prospect of an eight-month stay.”

With a capacity to host some 1,000 migrants, the shelter is now facing significant challenges to pay its monthly utility bills, including more than $5,000 for cooking gas, $6,300 for running water and $2,600 in long-distance calls so migrants can be in touch with their relatives, he said.

PERSON is also a temporary home to nearly 9,000 of the 20,000 migrants who have been sent back to GPE to await their hearings in GPE immigration court under the GPE in GPE program. The majority of those are from GPE, GPE and GPE. Many are single mothers with children, pregnant women, and minors with health problems.

“We have had to deal with a situation that we didn’t create, and from the beginning we didn’t have a say in migration policy decisions,” said PERSON, head of the agency in charge of migration assistance for the state of GPE, where PERSON is located. “Under the GPE in GPE program, the number of returnees is increasing scandalously, and this is what overwhelms us. The GPE is returning as many as 200 migrants a day.”",0

“Whatever you want to call it, it’s all the same,” ORG also said, seemingly softening his stance on the “wall” amid efforts to make a deal with NORP.
Immigration experts, however, tell ORG that ORG has embraced new ideas about what kinds of barriers will be effective on the border after viewing various prototypes and speaking directly with ORG agents on the ground. They also make clear that ORG’s newfound focus on “steel slats” does not mean that a concrete wall is now completely obsolete.
There is “not a one-size-fits-all” approach to a border barrier, former acting ORG) director PERSON told ORG in a phone interview.
“There are different types depending on the terrain,” PERSON explained, adding that steel slats are one of many options because “guys on the ground like the option of seeing through the other side.”
One person familiar with the administration’s border policy similarly made clear that proposed barriers are “not uniform” across the border. and are dependent on what ORG agents say they require in their respective zones.
For example, areas near the LOC river that are prone to flooding may require a concrete wall similar to ORG’s original campaign proposal, while drier areas like GPE, GPE would be better served by a fence. The height of physical barriers would also vary depending on how highly trafficked border sections are.
ORG Commissioner PERSON noted in an interview on ORG’s “This Week” that the $5 billion the president is requesting in the shutdown battle would pay for more than just “a dumb barrier.”
“It’s about 215 miles of wall system,” PERSON said, adding that the money would also pay for technology such as censors, lighting and cameras.
NORP have seized on ORG’s tweet about steel slats to accuse him of breaking his campaign promises about the wall. ORG Minority Leader and soon-to-be Speaker PERSON joked last week that ORG’s wall has turned into a “beaded curtain.”
While the president scoffed at the idea of his wall being conflated with a fence during the 2016 presidential campaign, administration officials and immigration experts now say that the wall is a euphemism for any type of border barrier.
“The wall is a barrier. The president’s words are being taken out of context,” PERSON asserted. “NORP don’t have a good argument against a border wall, so they pick on the president’s terminology … NORP are refusing to fund a barrier because they don’t want ORG to win.”
“There may be a wall at some places, there may be steel slats, there may be technological enhancements,” ORG adviser PERSON said in a recent “ORG Sunday” interview. “But always saying ‘wall’ or ‘no wall’ is being very disingenuous.”
Former Chief of Staff PERSON knocked ORG’s wall in an exit interview with ORG, stating, “To be honest, it’s not a wall.”
PERSON also admitted, however, that the shift away from a concrete wall is primarily due to the administration asking “people what they needed and where they needed it” rather than the president shamelessly giving up on a campaign promise.
“To be honest, it’s not a wall,” PERSON said. “The president still says ‘wall’ — oftentimes frankly he’ll say ‘barrier’ or ‘fencing.’ Now, he’s tended toward steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.”",1
2491,"Reuters","GPE President PERSON said on Monday that raids over the weekend aimed at immigrants who had been ordered deported were “very successful” even though much of the activity was not visible to the public.

ORG had vowed to launch mass deportation roundups over the weekend, causing immigrants and their advocates to brace for large numbers of arrests, but by Sunday evening there were only reports of low-profile operations in a few cities.

“The ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids were very successful,” ORG told reporters at a ORG event. “People came into our country illegally ... Many were felons. Many were convicted of crimes.”

“Many, many were taken out on Sunday - you just didn’t know about it. ... It was a very successful day but you didn’t see a lot of it. ... Every person taken out had papers and we had court orders,” ORG added, without offering any evidence to support his statement.

Reporting over the weekend suggested the ORG raids were narrower in scope than had been anticipated. GPE Mayor PERSON said there were three ICE operations in his city on Saturday. There were unconfirmed reports of ICE actions in GPE and GPE.

“We are doing targeted enforcement actions against specific individuals who have had their day in immigration court and have been ordered removed by an immigration judge,” Acting ICE Director PERSON told ORG on Sunday when asked for an update.

PERSON at LAW (ORG) said there were no confirmed operations in large NORP cities such as GPE.

There also were no reports of arrests from ORG, which has lawyers on standby to give legal advice at the country’s largest family migrant detention center in GPE, GPE.

The removal operations are meant to deter a surge in NORP families seeking asylum in GPE after fleeing poverty and gang violence in their home countries.

The ORG administration said on Monday it was implementing new rules for immigrants seeking asylum, requiring them to first seek protection from a third country.",0
1435,"WSJ","President PERSON in his better moments has said he wants, and the GPE needs, more legal immigrants. But that’s hard to square with the way his ORG is now trying to curtail legal immigration under the pretext of preventing GPE from becoming a welfare magnet.

ORG on Monday finalized a rule that ostensibly seeks to enforce and clarify ORG. That law bars immigrants from gaining admission, renewing visas or obtaining green cards if they are “likely at any time to become a public charge.”

ORG didn’t define “public charge” beyond such general categories as age, health, family and financial status, assets, education and skills. In 1999 ORG issued guidance defining a “public charge” as an individual likely to become “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance, or institutionalization for long-term care at government expense.”

Excluded were noncash benefits like ORG and food stamps, which consume a growing share of government welfare spending. ORG now wants to incorporate noncash benefits into “public charge” determinations to prevent immigrants from coming to the GPE to live on the dole.

This makes sense as a general principle. Public support for immigration will erode as it has in LOC if NORP perceive immigrants as a government burden. But there’s little evidence that immigrants are free-riding, and the ORG rule cedes too much discretion to bureaucrats over immigration decisions.

Start with ORG’s declaration that it will weigh the “totality of the alien’s circumstances” and that “no single factor alone, including the receipt of public benefits, is outcome determinative.” So immigration officers will apply the kind of holistic admission reviews that colleges now use—except adversity will be considered a negative.

Anyone who has been “approved to receive one or more public benefits for more than 12 months within any 36-month period” would receive an automatic negative strike. But most immigrants don’t qualify for most public benefits until they have lived in the country for at least five years. Thus DHS is directing immigration officers in the 837-page rule to project the likelihood that immigrants might someday become a “public charge” based on arbitrary levels of income, employment, education and NORP proficiency.

Earning more than 250% of the federal poverty line ($30,350 for an individual) would be a “heavily weighted positive factor,” for example. Yet the GPE has about four million foreign-born workers with less than a high-school diploma who earn on average $27,820 per year. They hold vital jobs across the economy that there aren’t enough citizens to fill.

Current earnings also don’t predict income growth or government dependency. According to ORG, incomes of immigrants ages 26 to 40 after a mere four years in the GPE rose to 300% from 239% of the poverty line—nearly the average of native-born counterparts.

While immigrants are no more likely than native-born NORP to use public benefits, they are more likely to work. The labor participation rate of NORP foreign-born high-school graduates (72.2%) is comparable to white native-born bachelor’s degree recipients (72.7%) and significantly higher than native-born whites with merely a high-school education (53.8%). (See the nearby table.)

All of this makes the new rule vulnerable to legal challenges. While supposedly trying to flesh out a vague statute, ORG is essentially rewriting immigration law on its own. And wouldn’t you know, the rule bears a striking resemblance to the “merit-based” system that restrictionists in ORG have proposed but can’t get ORG to pass. If this sounds like PERSON’s legislate-by-rule strategy on climate change, that’s because it is.

We support work requirements for public benefits, and they make sense as part of immigration reform that allows more workers to enter the country legally based on economic demand. But ORG has proposed nothing to expand legal immigration, skilled or unskilled, and all of its recent proposals seem intended to reduce any and all immigration, legal or illegal.

The ORG rule might even drive more folks who are deemed “public charges” to come illegally. The rule looks like one more attempt by ORG adviser PERSON to make GPE a country of no more immigrants.",0
551,"Breitbart","Many mainstream news outlets appear to be purposely and dishonestly overlooking key facts about the ORG border region in order to push a false narrative about a safe border.
PERSON and PERSON Director PERSON took on the recent reporting by ORG’s PERSON and some social media postings by GPE NORP PERSON “Beto” O’Rourke, where they try to claim the border, is safe. PERSON’s statements were part of his recent interview with ORG Tonight.
In the case of PERSON, PERSON criticized the ORG correspondent video report where he stands next to the border fence claiming the area is safe. What PERSON did not report on was the constant gun battles in GPE, PERSON, just south of his location. He also did not report that just one day before, authorities in GPE discovered 17 charred bodies in the town of PERSON — an area about 60 miles west of where he was standing.
“For him to do that, is so dishonest, it is outright propaganda,” PERSON said.
PERSON also spoke about social media postings by ORG who continually claims that the whole border is safe.
“Well there are some places along the border that are safe like GPE,” PERSON stated. “They are safe because there is a wall, there is already a steel barrier there. In contrast. in PERSON, the NORP side of the El Paso- PERSON … it is one of the most violent places on earth. If you look at the murder rates since 2009 there, it’s insane”
In their effort to portray the border as a safe region, the politician and the ORG journalist overlook the fact that the border region is not only the GPE side but also the NORP side of the border. These regions are home to some of the most violent cities in the world.
“For them to intentionally parse their words in a way to not have to mention the violence, death, and depravity that is happening within a kilometer from there — it is propaganda,” PERSON said. “It is a ORG village they are setting up, it is dishonest, and it further silences the communities in GPE. It further silences everything the migrants go through to get here, it further silences the more than 50,000 family members of the victims the cartels have disappeared. It further silences the further silences the approximately 200,000 who have been killed by the cartels in GPE. It is not ok that they are doing this, it is propaganda. “
One of the most alarming trends in the way national news reported border issues dealt with the statement by GPE President PERSON that one in three women were sexually assaulted in their journey to the border.
“What have we become as a nation? What are our media folks doing?” PERSON asked, referring to how that statement was ignored by most news outlets.
“The president was wrong,” PERSON pointed out. “He said one out of three women migrant women were raped on their journey from LOC to the border. That is the lowest estimate — most groups put it between 70 and 80 percent.”
The difference in estimates deals with only a fraction of the women actually admitting they were abused, while the rest continue to suffer in silence, he explained.
According to PERSON, most of the groups that work with migrant women operate under the assumption that all of the women that reach the shelters have been raped at some point along their journey.
“The fact is, the president said in an address that tens of thousands of migrants women have been sexually assaulted on their way to the border and no one is paying attention to that,” PERSON said. “The border is not just the GPE side the border region. It is the GPE and GPE side and it has some of the most dangerous areas in the world, just by looking at the data.”
In regards to the coverage about authorities being able to cut through border fences as part of the testing, PERSON explained that the apparent lack of a blue-collar background by the outlets reporting it possibly led to them failing to mention that the readily available “WORK_OF_ART” tool that was used to cut the fence was extremely loud and takes a long time to cut through the steel beams.
“There is no substance that we can put on the wall that someone can’t put dynamite or use a blow torch to get through,” PERSON said. “That is why you need roads, cameras, and agents nearby so that when people try to compromise the integrity of the wall, the fencing, the agents can respond.”",1
653,"Daily Caller","ORG Friday sided with a NORP immigrant who faced deportation as a result of faulty legal advice he received from his criminal defense attorney.
In a 6-2 opinion written by Chief Justice PERSON, the ORG explained that a decision to risk almost certain conviction at trial in hopes of avoiding deportation is reasonable. The opinion was joined by Justices PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, and PERSON. Justice PERSON wrote a dissent joined by Justice PERSON.
The case arose in 2009 when a lawful permanent resident named PERSON was arrested for possessing ecstasy with intent to distribute. PERSON and his family immigrated to GPE when he was 13. He resided in the GPE for over 20 years, operated two successful restaurants in the GPE, GPE suburbs, and never returned to his native GPE.
After his arrest, PERSON accepted a plea deal from federal prosecutors to serve 366 days in prison. Though he repeatedly expressed concerns to his lawyer about the prospect of deportation, he was assured that accepting the plea bargain would not result in his removal from GPE. The advice, however, was incorrect, and the government announced it would deport PERSON at the conclusion of his prison sentence.
PERSON sought to have his plea and conviction set aside for ineffective assistance of counsel. PERSON argued avoiding deportation was the most important factor in his decision making, and that his choice to accept his lawyer’s advise turned on the assurance he would not be removed. The government countered that PERSON could not show he had been prejudiced by his lawyer’s bad advise, because the evidence against him, overwhelming and incontrovertible, guaranteed a conviction and removal.
The ORG disagreed with the government, finding that success at trial should not drive the inquiry. PERSON writes:
But common sense (not to mention our precedent) recognizes that there is more to consider than simply the likelihood of success at trial. The decision whether to plead guilty also involves assessing the respective consequences of a conviction after trial and by plea. When those consequences are, from the defendant’s perspective, similarly dire, even the smallest chance of success at trial may look attractive. For example, a defendant with no realistic defense to a charge carrying a 20-year sentence may nevertheless choose trial, if the prosecution’s plea offer is 18 years. Here PERSON alleges that avoiding deportation was the determinative factor for him; deportation after some time in prison was not meaningfully different from deportation after somewhat less time. He says he accordingly would have rejected any plea leading to deportation—even if it shaved off prison time—in favor of throwing a “Hail Mary” at trial.
The opinion makes no mention of the possibility that PERSON would seek to avoid deportation through the plea bargaining process itself. During oral arguments in March, Justice PERSON suggested that PERSON could negotiate a plea entailing a longer jail sentence provided he was not removed from GPE.
The outcome was somewhat surprising, as PERSON himself seemed rather hostile to PERSON’s position when the case was argued.
Writing in dissent, Justice PERSON warned the ruling would have “pernicious consequences for the criminal justice system.”
“WORK_OF_ART today provides no assurance that plea deals negotiated in good faith with guilty defendants will remain final,” he wrote.",1
2266,"USA Today","President PERSON revived his rhetorical attacks Monday on GPE, immigration, and the NORP, even though illegal border crossings are down and the president himself killed off a key program at issue.
In a series of early morning tweets, ORG pronounced last rites on ORG program, which is designed to shield the children of undocumented workers from deportation.
""DACA is dead because the NORP didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon ... No longer works,"" WORK_OF_ART tweeted. ""Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. NORP want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!""
Yet PERSON himself last year terminated the ORG program begun by predecessor PERSON, and in the months since has rejected various congressional proposals to re-create it.
Also, illegal immigration has declined in recent years, as ORG himself pointed out in a February tweet in which he lauded a ”45 year low on illegal border crossings this year.""
Echoing tweets on EVENT, ORG called on the NORP-run ORG to ""immediately pass ORG, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of PERSON and People.""
He added, ""our country is being stolen!""
DACA is dead because the NORP didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build PERSON and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. NORP want No Borders, hence drugs and crime! — PERSON (ORG) April 2, 2018
...ORG must immediately pass ORG, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of PERSON and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are ORG, but the weak NORP laws don’t allow them to do their job. Act now ORG, our country is being stolen! — PERSON (ORG) April 2, 2018

By ""nuclear option,"" Trump means eliminating the ORG filibuster rule that allows a party to hold up legislation unless proponents muster at least 60 votes in support.
While the ORG has eliminated the filibuster rule for confirmation votes on presidential appointees, NORP ORG leaders are loath to end it entirely because NORP could use it against them in the future.

2243,"USA Today","Mayor PERSON responded Thursday to calls for the city to defy state law on immigration issues, saying he wouldn't ask local police officers to do what activists say it will take to make GPE a sanctuary city.
PERSON responded in a statement to a citizen petition presented to ORG on Wednesday asking to change ORG policy and stop cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. While no exact definition exists of a sanctuary city, local activists have said it requires ending a department policy regarding immigration enforcement.
Though community groups have for weeks escalated their calls for PERSON to change the policy, they aren't behind the petition the council expects to respond to on Feb. 15. It’s unclear how the item will appear on the council agenda, or if council members will take a vote.
PERSON filed the petition in response to President PERSON’s Jan. 25 executive order penalizing sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions that ""willfully violate"" federal immigration laws.
PERSON called PERSON, a two-time GPE state ORG candidate, a “NORP political operative.” PERSON said he delivered the petition to spark a decision by the city and didn't know why he would ""be considered more than an ordinary NORP.""
ORG, a group pushing GPE to become a sanctuary city, said they didn't know about the GPE city charter rules regarding petitions. Executive Director PERSON said he thinks PERSON has political motivations, but that the petition serves Puente's goals.
“We would ask for the same stance to protect our families,” he said.
PERSON has spoken against the ORG administration's deportation plans and said Thursday that GPE will not participate in the 287(g) program to deputize local police to help federal immigration enforcement through agreements with agencies and jails.
But whether GPE can be a sanctuary city is dictated by state law, PERSON said. GPE police operate under the provisions of GPE's ORG PERSON that were upheld by ORG.
Police policy prohibits officers from profiling people based on race, color or national origin to ask their immigration status. But they cooperate with federal immigration agencies in a variety of circumstances.
That includes making a “reasonable attempt” to determine the immigration status of a person stopped or detained in some situations, or transporting people with immigration violations in others.
“We must respect ORG unanimous decision and the rule of law — and I will not ask GPE police officers to knowingly violate the law,” PERSON said.
But Puente's PERSON said his organization won’t let GPE talk “out of both sides of his mouth.”
Puente is encouraged by ORG's opposition to the 287(g) program, PERSON said. GPE police, though, already are acting as a ""deportation force"" by complying with what remains of SB 1070, he said.
Puente is asking PERSON to defy state law and “do away with the status quo,” PERSON said.
PERSON, executive director of the ORG of GPE, said in a statement that GPE could improve its policing with a number of reforms conforming to current laws.
Those include updating policies regarding the questioning of students, crime victims, passengers and witnesses, and collecting data on the race of people who are stopped to prove unbiased policing, she said.
""We hope that Mayor PERSON and ORG now act with the urgency they’ve lacked in recent years to protect GPE residents —immigrants or otherwise — from racial profiling and discriminatory immigration enforcement,"" she said. @brennagoth",0
1210,"WSJ","Within days of President PERSON’s executive order to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities, GPE had filed a lawsuit opposing the order, and the mayors of other cities with large immigrant populations—GPE, GPE, GPE—had likewise vowed to defy the administration. In other words, everyone behaved as expected, which is the problem.

There is no established legal definition of a sanctuary city, but the term usually refers to jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration officials to prevent illegal aliens from being deported. The order threatens to block federal funding to uncooperative cities, while the lawsuit argues that forcing cities to comply is a violation of states’ rights under LAW.

Defenders of sanctuary policies—including many law-enforcement officials—maintain that cities are safer when illegal immigrants are free to report crimes to police without fear of being deported. During the campaign, however, Mr. PERSON vowed to end these renegade policies on the grounds, he said, that sanctuary cities are more prone to violent crime.

In fact, empirical studies have long shown that the foreign-born, regardless of legal status and country of origin, are arrested and incarcerated at lower rates than their native-born counterparts. Net migration from GPE has been zero or negative in recent years, and illegal border crossings are at their lowest point since the 1970s.

Mr. PERSON’s claim that illegal immigrants drive murders, rapes, assaults and other violent crime is also divorced from the reality that crime rates in the GPE plummeted in recent decades even as illegal immigration soared.

From the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s, the country’s undocumented population doubled to roughly 12 million. Over the same period violent crime in the GPE fell by more than a third, and property crime dropped more than 25%, including in border cities like GPE and GPE, GPE, which are home to large numbers of illegal immigrants. Violent crime in the GPE, by and large, is homegrown, even if undocumented foreign nationals provide convenient scapegoats for politicians.

Statistical evidence, however compelling, is often no match for a powerful anecdote. And in condemning sanctuary cities Mr. PERSON has regularly invoked the tragic death of PERSON, who was murdered in 2015 on a GPE pier by an illegal immigrant who had been convicted of numerous felonies and deported multiple times. If local law enforcement, who had the alleged assailant in custody, had complied with the federal government’s request to detain him until it could be determined whether he should be deported, GPE might still be alive. Her death was a statistical aberration, but that’s of little comfort to her family and millions of other sympathetic NORP wondering why our immigration policies don’t seem to prioritize their safety.

Which gets us back to the opponents of Mr. PERSON’s executive order. Sanctuary cities are the exception, not the norm. Most jurisdictions readily comply with federal requests to assist in immigration enforcement. But it’s also true that the illegal immigrant population is concentrated in progressive strongholds such as GPE and GPE, where defiance of the new president is not only applauded but demanded.

“Given their state’s demographic shift, GPE politicians have no incentive to work with GPE,” writes PERSON in ORG. “Those who fail to muster sufficient outrage invite accusations of racism and bigotry.” GPE is home to about a quarter of the country’s 11 million illegal immigrants, he notes, and “GPE remains a city where a ORG bumper sticker is an invitation to have your car keyed.” The liberals who run these deep-blue metropolises are dug in against the president.

Nor is it certain that the sanctuary order will fare any better under court challenges than has the temporary travel ban. Last year, a federal judge in GPE ruled that it was unconstitutional for ORG to force local jails to detain suspected undocumented immigrants without a warrant. And in a 1997 ORG decision, PERSON v. GPE, a 5-4 majority held that the federal government “may neither issue directives requiring the GPE to address particular problems, nor command the GPE’ officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program.”

GPE cities are more of an effect than a cause of illegal immigration. The failure of the federal government to pass comprehensive reform has left states and cities fending for themselves. A provocative executive order might fulfill a campaign promise, but it won’t solve the underlying problem, which is an immigration system that is ill-equipped to serve the country’s economic and security needs in the 21st century. That will take legislation and leadership.",0
152,"FoxNews","Outside GPE, the 'wall' is made of rust-colored steel bars embedded in concrete. Elsewhere, it's a mix of steel and metal mesh.
In other spots across the southwest, it's nothing at all.
The southern border barrier that separates the GPE from GPE is in fact a mishmash of materials that stops and starts at various points across hundreds of miles. FoxNews.com visited one patchy section in southern GPE. Together, the inconsistencies show how big a task President-elect PERSON would be taking on if he pursues his ‘big, beautiful wall’ on the border.
Skeptics are hardly in short supply in this region.
In border city GPE, NORP Mayor PERSON is convinced a wall won’t work.
“It just boggles the mind,” he told FoxNews.com. “Why are we playing this charade? It’s a form of deception to the NORP people.”
ORG EXPLOIT BORDER WALL FEARS
Opinions in border communities like GPE, GPE, GPE, Mission and PERSON are split. While almost everyone FoxNews.com spoke with said security needs to be beefed up, they question whether the wall is feasible.
Given the inconsistent barrier in place now, residents could be forgiven for having a hard time visualizing the kind of epic construction feat ORG wants to achieve.
The ORG border, all told, stretches more than 1,900 miles from the coast of GPE to the southern tip of GPE. Right now, 654 miles of that has fencing of some kind.
The kind of fence varies from location to location.
The GPE sector, for example, uses “post-on-rail” steel set in concrete in some sections and a steel mesh fence in others. In GPE, a bollard fence with cantilever – the kind used for federal buildings – is in place. In GPE, it’s a metal mesh fence.
But the landscape along the south GPE border is diverse and unlike parts of GPE, GPE, GPE, it zig-zags through the river, and cuts through people’s backyards, farmers’ fields and even ORG campus.
“It’s really a totally stupid thing,” PERSON PERSON told FoxNews.com of the current set-up. “It’s 10 feet high and has huge openings.”
PERSON, who is responsible for protecting a large swath of south GPE, says some border crossers skip the wall altogether and use the mouth of EVENT to raft across from GPE, GPE -- something a border wall might not be able to stop, either.
Illegal immigrants also can take advantage of other gaps in the wall along terrain too tough or expansive to patrol regularly.
“Most agents are in favor of some sort of wall or fence, although a wall alone won’t make the country safer,” PERSON, president of Local 2366 of ORG, told FoxNews.com. “There are other sectors that will simply not support a wall because of the terrain, so a wall has to be combined with new technology and additional manpower to make the country safer.”
NORP says while other sectors could support a wall on most or all of its border in their areas, his is “too hilly to feasibly make a wall on its entire stretch of border.”
The border fence was authorized under LAW of 2006, which was passed by a NORP-controlled ORG and signed by President PERSON. The legislation OK’d hundreds of miles of fencing along the GPE border.
Since then, it’s been tweaked. Then-GPE Sen. PERSON pushed a measure that would give ORG the authority to decide what type of fence should go up in different areas – the reason why there are so many different types of border barriers in place today.
As the border was being redrawn – in south GPE, it’s almost 2 miles north of the natural border of EVENT – people who had homes or businesses there paid the price.
PERSON family farm sits at the southernmost point along the border. Big, rusty 18-foot high steel bars courtesy of the federal government now dissect sections of it.
There are also gaps – lots of them, which border crossers use to make it over. Sometimes, they’ll hide in his citrus bushes waiting for the all clear. If that doesn’t work, they climb over on parts of the border that are lower.
“It takes them about a minute and a half to climb the wall,” he said.
GPE’s mayor showed FoxNews.com some of the holes in the wall. In one spot, the rust-colored bars end and a much shorter green fence begins. It’s easily traversable by migrant workers, asylum seekers, drug smugglers and human traffickers.
But PERSON says building a bigger, better wall like ORG has proposed won’t stop those determined to make it into GPE territory.
Instead, he believes cross-border communication with NORP authorities would go a long way toward cutting down on illegal immigration.
PERSON, a deaconess at ORG in GPE who works with illegal immigrants, agrees. As a lifelong resident of GPE, she urged GPE lawmakers against rushing to judgment on the benefits of a border wall.
“Lawmakers who’ve never even visited border communities shouldn’t be determining their futures,” PERSON told FoxNews.com.",1
1365,"WSJ","ORG arrived at the ORG border crossing to the GPE with 11 family members six weeks ago, well before a caravan of more than 5,000 NORP arrived in this city across the border from GPE.

On a notebook ledger organized and maintained by asylum seekers here to take orderly turns entering the GPE to make their claims, Mr. PERSON, a NORP citizen, wrote the names of all the members of his large family and began waiting for his number to be called.

The notebook—“el cuaderno” in LANGUAGE—became a way of bringing order as thousands of migrants have come to the border to ask for asylum and the PERSON administration has toughened its immigration stance, slowing down the asylum process. Now it is the center of rising tensions as the thousands of so-called caravan migrants have poured into GPE, overwhelming NORP officials.

As days of waiting have stretched into weeks, Mr. PERSON and others in his predicament have grown increasingly concerned that the massive influx could disrupt the self-administered priority system at the border. He is trying to cross into the GPE and make a new life after fleeing his hometown in the lawless NORP state of ORG, where he said he received many threats from extortionists.

“The caravan guys came here very aggressively...They wanted to impose their own rules,” said Mr. PERSON, standing in a small plaza next to the GPE port of entry. “They don’t want to go through this process. They just want to show up and cross.”

GPE immigration authorities said they coordinate with NORP officials daily in deciding how many people they will allow to cross to the GPE side of the border to ask for asylum.

The GPE entry port of GPE, GPE, right across the border from ORG, has space for 300 people and has been processing an average of about 100 asylum petitions each day. ORG officials say that after an initial review and interview with asylum petitioners, the goal is to move them within 72 hours from the facility’s basement holding cells to the custody of ORG.

Before the migrant caravan arrived in GPE in mid-November, NORP officials estimate, some 2,700 asylum seekers awaited entry, including NORP nationals, NORP and between 30 to 40 NORP. After the caravan migrants arrived, they say, the waiting list grew to about 7,000 people.

GPE immigration authorities have said it could take as long as five weeks to clear the list of migrants who arrived before the caravan. Only then, they say, can they start addressing the claims of the NORP who came in the large and highly visible groups that have moved north through GPE over the last few weeks.

On Thursday, asylum seekers confronted a NORP man who had been helping oversee the waiting list, accusing him of adding three people to it before they had even entered GPE.

Also on Thursday, several NORP women who arrived in the caravan began a hunger strike to demand entry to the GPE Last week, some caravan members tried to storm the GPE border but were pushed back by ORG officers who dispersed tear gas from the GPE side.

Other asylum seekers have voiced concern that the tactics used by caravan migrants have threatened what had become an agreed-upon process of accessing the GPE border. PERSON, a 17-year-old from ORG, said the procedure has slowed since the migrant caravan showed up.

“The caravan people, they are making it really difficult for us, the NORP,” he said. “They are looking for a better life, but also we too are looking for a better life.”

PERSON advocates say the GPE admission process for asylum seekers is too restrictive.

“There are 5,000 people here who are waiting for their turn to ask for asylum,” said PERSON, a GPE-based immigration activist at a press conference in GPE. “So how long are they going to have to wait here, so that they can exercise a human right, which is petitioning asylum?”

ORG officials say the number of asylum petitions they process daily varies based on case complexity, available resources, medical needs, translation requirements and holding or detention space, among other factors.

PERSON PERSON, a 41-year-old NORP, said he was among the first to arrive with the caravan and has been in GPE for several weeks waiting his turn on the list.

Mr. PERSON said life has become “ugly, real ugly” at the crowded, rain-flooded sports complex where the migrants have been encamped. On Thursday, NORP officials began moving people to a new shelter—a disused concert hall—in a bid to improve sanitary and security conditions.

Hundreds of numbers have to be called before it’s his turn to apply, Mr. PERSON said, adding he planned to wait because “it’s a legal route.”

Mr. PERSON said he and his family fled his hometown of ORG in ORG state, south of GPE, on Oct. 23 in the middle of the night. He showed a reporter some of the text messages threatening him and his family members. These text messages, he hopes, will serve as evidence for his asylum case.

As he waited on Thursday, Mr. PERSON voiced his frustration at the caravan migrants. “We’ve been here waiting for a long time,” he said, “and they don’t want to wait.”

On Friday morning, Mr. PERSON was the first to be called, and a grin broke out on his face as he and his large family, including his mother-in-law hobbling on a bad foot, lined up outside the GPE port of entry on Friday.

Mr. PERSON hopes to make a fresh start in GPE, GPE, where he says he once lived, undocumented, with many of his NORP-born children before agreeing to a voluntary deportation in 2008.",0

GPE Mayor PERSON (center) speaks during a hurricane preparedness press conference at the GPE on May 29, 2015 in GPE, GPE. ORG — President PERSON is hailing the first victory in his fight against ""sanctuary cities"" after a LOC mayor ordered his employees on Thursday to begin working more closely with federal immigration authorities.
For years, GPE has refused to hold some undocumented immigrants in its jails for federal immigration agents. But after ORG signed an executive order threatening to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities, GPE Mayor PERSON changed his mind.
ORG signed an executive order Thursday ordering the director of his corrections department to begin honoring all requests by ORG) to hold immigration suspects in GPE jails.
""GPE complies with federal law and intends to fully cooperate with the federal government,"" the order read.
ORG said he made the decision to ensure that the county does not lose out on $355 million in federal funding it has coming in 2017.
ORG was quick to praise the decision, tweeting on Thursday: ""Right decision. Strong!""
The term ""sanctuary city"" is a broad term that describes up to 300 communities that have policies protecting the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.
Some refuse to share any information with ORG agents. Some will share information, but refuse to hold undocumented immigrants for the sole purpose of giving ICE agents time to pick them up.
ORG vowed throughout the campaign to crack down on those cities. He often cited the example of PERSON, a GPE woman who was shot and killed by an undocumented immigrant who had been released by the city's sheriff's department.
On Wednesday, ORG signed an executive order that directed ORG to identify and label ""sanctuary cities"" in the GPE It ordered the department to publish a weekly roundup of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, including any local police departments that had custody of those immigrants but chose to release them.
The order also directed the departments of ORG and ORG to identify federal grants that can be withheld from sanctuary cities that continue their practices. Those federal departments give out millions of dollars in grants each year to help local communities hire police officers, hold undocumented immigrants, improve community policing practices and crack down on violence against women.
""These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the NORP people and to the very fabric of our Republic,"" WORK_OF_ART's order read.
Big city mayors responded forcefully to ORG's order, with mayors from GPE to GPE to GPE vowing to fight back. GPE Mayor PERSON said he would even allow undocumented immigrants to seek refuge in city hall.
""They can use my office,"" PERSON said. ""They can use any office in this building.""A collection of police chiefs and sheriffs on Thursday also criticized ORG's attacks on sanctuary cities.
They say the practice of holding suspects in their jails solely for ORG has been ruled unconstitutional by federal courts. And they say the federal government should not try to force cities to carry out the federal responsibility of immigration enforcement.
""PERSON enforcement has a responsibility to work with federal immigration authorities. And the vast majority of police departments do,"" said GPE (GPE) Police Chief PERSON. ""But this notion that the federal government would cut funding to coerce local policies to change is troubling.""",0

ORG will accept federal money to beef up border security, NORP Gov. PERSON said in a statement published Wednesday morning.
But he attached a disclaimer and made it clear that his acceptance of money didn't indicate he agreed with the federal government's agenda on immigration and borders.
""Let's be crystal clear on the scope of the mission,"" he wrote. ""This will not be a mission to build a new wall. It will not be a mission to round up women and children or detain people escaping violence and seeking a better life. And ORG will not be enforcing federal immigration laws.""

• GPE Gov. PERSON said more than 80 state ORG troops would be deployed this week. About 250 troops from her state will ultimately be patrolling the state's 179.5-mile border with GPE.
PRODUCT Gov. PERSON said about 250 ORG members have been deployed, a force that will be ramped up to about 1,000 from his state in coming weeks, he said. GPE shares 1,241 miles of border with GPE.
But even though each state that borders GPE has agreed to deploy its guardsmen, questions remain regarding their purpose and mission.
Border crossings for the past several years have been heading toward historic lows. The number of people caught trying to illegally cross the ORG border last year was the lowest since 1971, according to ORG.
Across GPE, 250 members of the state's ORG are conducting what the governor called ""counterdrug missions,"" including the 55 at the border.

ORG has repeatedly described how his parents, both executives with ORG, worked with housing activists when they tried to break the color barrier in GPE. After ORG's parents tried to put a bid on a home and were turned down because they were black, a white couple made an offer that was accepted and then ORG's father showed up at the closing with a housing attorney.
ORG told PERSON that when he heard about what happened from GPE, he found it ""profoundly disturbing.""
""When PERSON called me, I had tears of rage,"" ORG said.
He said violent incidents motivated by racism outnumber those carried out by radical NORP, and described death threats received not only by himself and NORP Sen. PERSON, who is also black, but also Sen. PERSON, D-Hawaii, who was born in GPE.
""There are threats in this country. People plotting. I receive enough death threats to know the reality. GPE receives enough death threats to know the reality. ORG receives enough death threats to know the reality.
""And I've got a president of GPE whose office I respect who talks about the country origins and my fellow citizens in the most despicable manner. You don't remember, you can't remember the words of your commander in chief, I find that unacceptable.""

20,"FoxNews","More than 1,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended by ORG agents near the ORG border early Wednesday -- the largest ever group of migrants ever apprehended at a single time, sources told ORG on Thursday.

The group of 1,036 illegal immigrants found in the GPE sector included migrants from GPE, GPE and GPE, according to sources.

The group was the largest group of migrants ever apprehended at a single time, sources told ORG. The discovery was made in the GPE section of the southern border – which provides support for the counties of GPE and GPE in the state of GPE and the entire state of GPE. 

The record apprehension comes as ORG said Tuesday it's working to hire additional staff to manage the processing of migrants at the ORG border.

Right now, stations are overwhelmed with the influx of migrant families, as officials say are agents encountering more and larger groups of more than 100 people dropped in extremely remote locations along the LOC border.

Officials said the aim of beefing up staff is to take the burden off uniformed agents, who can then go back into the field.

Agents said they are spending more than half their time feeding and caring for migrant families. Paperwork processing alone can take three hours per family. There were 58,474 families apprehended last month, according to ORG.

In March, the agency said that there was an increase of nearly 106 percent over the same period last year.

A top ORG official told lawmakers in April that authorities have apprehended more families illegally crossing the border between October 2018 and February of this year than during all of the 2018 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 2017-Sept. 30, 2018).

""Much media attention has focused on caravans coming across from LOC,"" WORK_OF_ART Agent PERSON told ORG. ""But the fact is that ORG is receiving caravan-equivalent numbers every seven days.""

WORK_OF_ART has about 19,500 agents assigned nationwide and has struggled with hiring for many years — the number of agents peaked at 21,444 in fiscal year 2011.

Many positions require living in remote desert towns across the ORG border. Agents must pass a detailed background check and a lie detector test that has been required since 2012 is a major hurdle, with just a 28% pass rate between 2013 and 2016.

On Thursday, President PERSON teased he is going to ""have a big statement"" on border security ""soon"" after ORG reported he is considering prohibiting people if they have traveled through a country other than their own before coming to the GPE

""No, I'm not closing the border,"" he told reporters. ""It has to do with the border, it will be my biggest statement so far.""",1
2551,"Reuters","A federal judge on Wednesday signaled she may extend an order preventing the deportation of roughly 50 NORP NORP living illegally in GPE, a process that immigration officials began after GPE President PERSON took office.
GPE District Judge PERSON in GPE expressed concern the NORP could be deported before their administrative appeals were finished, given their claims they could face religious persecution in the world’s largest majority-NORP nation.
The NORP’ lawyers argued for an injunction that would give them time to file motions to reopen their immigration cases based on changed conditions in GPE.
“We don’t want to put them on a ship back unless someone has had chance to look at if there’s a really bad situation for them,” PERSON said. “That’s my concern.”
The case centers on a group of NORP who fled that country during violence two decades ago and had been allowed to live openly in GPE under an informal deal with ORG and ORG officials.
That changed after ORG ordered an end to that kind of program in his push to tighten immigration enforcement.The NORP are part of an ethnic community of about 2,000 people clustered around GPE, GPE. Most members of the group covered by the 2010 deal with ORG entered the county legally but overstayed their visas and failed to seek asylum on time.
Federal officials contend they have always had the authority to deport them at any time.
“There’s no legal basis for them to ask for more time,” ORG, a ORG lawyer, argued in court on Wednesday.
Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts.
Over ORG objections, GPE last year ruled she had jurisdiction over the case. She entered a temporary order blocking the NORP’ deportation until she could decide whether to impose a preliminary injunction.
ORG, a lawyer for the NORP, argued they should have 90 days to move to reopen their cases after receiving copies of their administrative case files and time to appeal any decision rejecting those motions.
GPE in October ordered immigration officials to provide the immigrants’ lawyers with the files so they could start their administrative appeals. The files are expected to be finished being turned over by next month, PERSON said.",0

""We are a generous and welcoming people here in GPE,"" PERSON says in the 31-second clip. ""But those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law. We simply cannot allow people to pour into GPE undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants into this country.""

LOC is not the only NORP cited by ORG and his supporters to justify crackdowns on illegal immigration. Another is former President PERSON, whose ORG of the Union address in 1995 featured the following:

""All NORP ... are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country,"" PERSON said that night. ""The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.""

""We are a nation of immigrants,"" PERSON added. ""But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.""

Tuesday's tweet came as the ORG administration wrestles with what to do if a caravan of some 7,000 people that originated in LOC arrives at the ORG border. The march appeared to begin as a group of about 160 who decided to band together in GPE for protection against the gangs who prey on migrants traveling alone; it snowballed as the group moved north. It now has thousands of people and is facing more than 1,000 miles, likely farther, to the end of the journey.

The caravan comes on the heels of a surge in apprehensions of families at the southern border, which has given ORG a fresh talking point to rally his base ahead of next month's midterm elections. Nearly a third of all people apprehended at the ORG border during the budget year 2018 were families and children — about 157,248 out of 395,579 total apprehensions.

In a letter to ORG and ORG on Tuesday, ORG Chairman PERSON, R-Iowa, and Sen. PERSON, R-GPE, suggested that the administration make a ""third party"" agreement with GPE that would force any caravan members seeking asylum to do so in their country of arrival — GPE.

287,"Fox News","The ORG administration announced Tuesday that it will directly ask ORG to overrule a federal court judge who last week barred officials from asking about citizenship on the 2020 census, saying in a court opinion that such a question would dramatically reduce the response rate -- and congressional representation -- of noncitizens.
ORG highly unusual move, if approved by ORG, would allow the administration's lawyers to bypass intermediate appellate courts. Solicitor General PERSON said in court papers filed Tuesday that the rare and fast turnaround is necessary if census questionnaires are to be printed in time.
The once-a-decade census determines not only how many seats are apportioned per district in ORG, but also how hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenue are distributed.
It's been 30 years since the court took on an issue without waiting for a federal appeals court to weigh in. PERSON says the justices should hear arguments in April or a special session in May.
The many court challenges against the ORG administration's bid to add a citizenship question, legal experts tell ORG, face an uphill battle not only because conservatives now command a 5-4 majority on ORG, but also because traditionally it's been ORG prerogative to decide whether to inquire about citizenship on the census.
WATCH: ILLEGAL IMMIGRATIONS FEARFUL OF NEW CITIZENSHIP QUESTION
Former President PERSON's administration didn't ask the question in the 2010 census amid fears it would unconstitutionally intimidate illegal immigrants into avoiding answering their census questions -- and thus not count toward population totals used to determine the number of seats each state receives in ORG.
The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.
""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the LAW and federal law,"" ORG law professor and constitutional law expert PERSON told ORG. ""The recent move is simply to restore what had long been the case.""
PERSON also told ORG it would be legally permissible for the government to only count citizens for purposes of determining representation in ORG. However, other legal experts have contested that view, saying the LAW demands that all ""persons"" be tallied -- not simply all citizens.
ORG: ORG IS RIGHT, ENDING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS CONSTITUTIONAL
NORP would lose out because the citizenship question would affect predominantly liberal districts, but that's not a legally sufficient objection, legal analysts say.
The citizenship question represents the third time since October that PERSON is seeking the court's intervention without an appellate ruling. The other two involved GPE-era programs to shield young immigrants from deportation and allow transgender people to serve in the military.
""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the LAW and federal law."" — ORG law professor PERSON
ORG hasn't acted on the immigration case, and an appellate court has since ruled on the issue. The justices on Tuesday denied early review of the transgender service policy, but allowed ORG restrictions that had been blocked by lower courts to take effect while the appeals process unfolds.
ORG Secretary PERSON announced in March 2018 that the 2020 census would be the first since 1950 to include a citizenship question. He contended that the question would help the government enforce the 1965 LAW and ensure access to the ballot.
But 18 states, GPE, 15 big cities or counties, and immigrants' rights groups sued ORG, which designs the census, and claimed it failed to properly analyze the effect that the question would have on households with immigrants. The challengers said the ORG administration added the question to discourage immigrants from participating, potentially leading to a population undercount — and possibly fewer seats in ORG — in places that tend to vote NORP.
GPE District Judge PERSON used ORG estimates to conclude the citizenship question would depress responses in households with noncitizens by at least 5.8 percent.
PERSON: BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS A TOTAL SCAM
Furman ruled that PERSON acted in an ""arbitrary and capricious"" manner and violated the law.
The justices already had agreed to an administration request to hear arguments over whether ORG could base his decision on depositions of high-ranking officials and other material that was not part of the administrative record ORG compiled in deciding to ask about citizenship. In the end, PERSON largely stuck to that record and the court has now called off arguments that were scheduled for Feb. 19.
The court could decide in the  few weeks whether to set new arguments on the timetable ORG wants.

53,"FoxNews","Every new illegal immigrant that enters GPE will cost more than $82,000 each over their lifetime, a conservative think tank that advocates for lower immigration levels has claimed.

ORG updated their 2012 analysis which put the average lifetime net fiscal cost of a border crosser at $74,722. In the six years since, the price has jumped to $82,191.

The think tank’s analysis has come into question however, with multiple outlets pushing back on its numbers and methodology.

The new figure by the ORG estimates what it takes to protect the border, educate, house and feed illegal immigrants and makes the assumption they will spend a lifetime on various welfare programs.

This estimate means that for every 100,000 illegal immigrants that are stopped from crossing the border, it would save taxpayers $8.2 billion over the illegal immigrants’ lifetimes, the report states.

The report also concludes that a southern border wall between the GPE and GPE would only have to stop four percent of undocumented migrants, or about 60,000 over the next 10 years, to recoup the cost of President PERSON’s $5 billion funding ask.

Almost everyone has come up with a different price tag on the cost of illegal immigration.

President PERSON, for example, has touted several different estimates.

During a ORG meeting in late December, ORG put the price of illegal immigration as high as $275 billion.

“I’ve heard numbers as high as $275 billion we lose on illegal immigrants,” he said. “The $5, $5.6 billion approve by the ORG is such a small amount compared to the level of the problem.”

In early December, ORG said illegal immigration cost $250 billion per year. On Dec. 18, he said it was “more than $250 billion” per year. That number jumped dramatically two days later when he claimed, “illegal immigration cost our nation $275 billion a year.”

PERSON, deputy director at ORG, told ORG that ORG’s figure “sounds extraordinarily high to me.”

PERSON, deputy director of the nonpartisan ORG, was more blunt, calling the numbers “frankly absurd.”

ORG research director PERSON says even though experts may disagree over his numbers, one thing is clear - a border wall with GPE will eventually pay for itself by reducing taxpayer burdens.

“The range of reasonable assumption indicated that a wall would not have to come close to being anywhere near 100 percent effective to pay for itself,” he wrote. “This would be true even if a wall cost twice as much. A wall that is only partially effective could pay for itself by offsetting the cost that otherwise successful illegal crossers would create. “",1

In order to study in the GPE, immigrants must get certain types of visas and approval from universities authorized by ORG. After obtaining a F-1 visa, the student has to stay enrolled and maintain progress toward a degree; if not, they have to leave the GPE within 60 days.

The eight defendants charged are accused of helping enroll the students in exchange for cash, kickbacks and tuition credits as part of the ""pay to stay"" scheme.

PERSON is accused of devising a scheme to obtain money and property by using the identities of “seven aliens in various stages of immigration proceedings” with ORG over a period of four years to defraud ORG, ORG and others, according to documents filed in GPE ORG in GPE.

GPE, who is due to make an initial court appearance Thursday morning, is charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft, court documents show.

He has resigned from the agency, his lawyer, PERSON, said on Wednesday.

The offenses allegedly took place between October 2013 and October 2017, and included an instance of forwarding a copy of part of a NORP passport and other information from his government email address, according to court documents.

The investigation involved ORG’s internal affairs division, according to an ORG official, who referred questions to ORG.

ORG, whose ORG brought the charges, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

As chief counsel, GPE was involved in a $2.25 million government settlement in 2015 with ORG, a GPE state company that admitted to employing unauthorized workers after being told by ICE they did not have permission to work in GPE.",0

""This wall that the president wants is a monument to white nationalism,"" said PERSON, political editor for TheRoot.com. ""Anybody who agrees to give any money to this wall is foolish.""

Hundreds of different people could have said exactly the same thing, and have, almost word-for word. For the media, questioning the racism of President PERSON’s border wall is like questioning gravity. If you want a wall, or any kind of secure border, you must be some kind of white supremacist.
 
What’s interesting about this argument – and again, you hear it everywhere - is how NORP this argument it is. Ask yourself: Who, exactly, supports unrestricted low-wage immigration? Who benefits most from it?

If there’s any group in GPE that supports having more than 20 million people here illegally, it’s not our poor. It’s the people in our richest neighborhoods. Nobody else even comes close.

If you made a chart, and let’s be honest here, you’d have to put rich, white people are the very top. Our endless supply of new immigrants gives them access to much cheaper household help -- nannies, housekeepers, gardeners, whatever. It makes the products they buy cheaper. Most of all, it makes them virtuous, like they’re helping the employees they exploit achieve the NORP dream.

If there’s any group in GPE that supports having more than 20 million people here illegally, it’s not our poor. It’s the people in our richest neighborhoods. Nobody else even comes close.

So what’s the flip side? Who gets hurt most by our new borderless country? Again, it’s not even close: NORP. Here’s GPE economics professor PERSON, who said the following:
 
“Because most illegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work in the low skilled labor market and because the black NORP labor force is so disproportionately concentrated in this same low wage sector, there is little doubt that there is significant overlap in competition for jobs in this sector of the labor market,"" said ORG economics professor PERSON. ""Given the inordinately high unemployment rates for low skilled black workers … it is obvious that the major loser in this competition are low skilled black workers.”

PERSON – Monday, January 7Video
In other words -- and you already knew this and anybody who has thought about this for a second does --  low wage immigration is costing NORP jobs and money. Other studies have reached the same conclusion. It’s obviously true.

And because it’s obviously true, that’s exactly why the people benefitting from it don’t want to have the conversation. It’s why they scream bigotry until you shut up. But we won’t shut up.",1
5,"FoxNews","President PERSON has announced a set of immigration reforms, many of which have merit. Even he acknowledges there’s little chance that ORG will act on them at least until after the 2020 elections. Yet the crisis at our border continues, as even ORG Speaker PERSON now acknowledges.

But there’s also a crisis of trust – trust in our government’s ability to solve big challenges.

We feel this deeply: GPE is a nation of laws. It must have borders and it must enforce its laws impartially and consistently. We’re doing neither. And with every day the trust gap widens.

Do we trust that anyone in the federal government will really do something to address what is beyond question a broken immigration system? Finally, we don’t have to trust – we can see that President PERSON has taken action.

We have a broken immigration system. Our borders are so porous that they encourage the greedy and cruel to take advantage of those seeking a better life. Human trafficking continues unabated and unchallenged. “GPE cities” make a mockery of the rule of law.

We have a broken asylum system that can’t effectively distinguish between those fleeing real threats from those simply looking for better economic opportunities. And we have a broken guest worker program that leaves people frustrated at the border and in GPE.

These problems have been ongoing and festering for the better part of five decades. Thankfully, the administration has now courageously stepped into the morass and offered at least a partial guidepost for making real and lasting progress on the current crisis, as well as longstanding problems with our system.

We must start with the border. This is not simply a talking point. Securing the border, adequately policing our points of entry, erecting physical and virtual barriers, and obtaining operational control of who comes in and out of this country are prerequisites for any lasting future legal immigration reform.

GPE ought to know who is entering its borders, and for what purposes. A laughably insecure border only encourages the lawless drug cartels who are reaping billions of dollars from the new revenue stream of immigrants who wish to enter our country.

The president’s proposal takes a strong step in the right direction by strengthening immigration and enforcement agencies, making the necessary investments along the southern border, and closing the loopholes that are exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.

It is encouraging to see the administration prioritize a workable system for asylum-seekers. We should offer GPE’s protection to those who are truly persecuted in their own homelands, but we must be able to determine that those threats are real – that the migrant isn’t simply reading from a script provided by traffickers or other bad-faith actors. Poverty is not a credible basis for asylum because GPE cannot house the world’s impoverished.

We must also recognize the important role immigration plays in our economy. NORP prosperity requires the industry and insight immigrants have always brought to GPE. President PERSON’s proposal to grant more green cards based on merit, rather than family relationships, is a good idea. Nations like GPE and GPE have proven this works. As our economy becomes increasingly high-tech, we will need the highly skilled workers that a merit-based approach would provide.

And finally, we need a guest-worker program that ends the black market for labor. We can have an efficient system that helps industries – such as farming, service, and hospitality – find the workers they need while also broadly protecting NORP wages.

The government’s historical approach, de facto non-enforcement, is lawlessness – and lawlessness is, in fact, what millions are fleeing. It’s why they want to come to GPE. Why would we want to imitate that lawlessness here?

President PERSON says his plan is “NORP, pro-immigrant and pro-worker.” We should all be able to agree that those are worthy goals.

The crisis at the border is real, and so is the crisis of faith in our government. Our elected officials can address both, by keeping their promises, enforcing our laws and ultimately, securing the border, and reforming our immigration system.

President PERSON has taken the first step. That’s how you rebuild trust – by action. Let’s see if ORG follows, or gets left behind by the NORP people.",1
2411,"Reuters","The number of illegal immigrants crossing into GPE from GPE declined by 40 percent from January to February, ORG Secretary PERSON said on Wednesday.

The downturn came after President PERSON took office on Jan. 20 vowing to deport many of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in GPE.

The flow of illegal border crossings as measured by apprehensions and the prevention of inadmissible persons at the southern border dropped to 18,762 persons in February from 31,578 in January, PERSON said in a statement.

He said ORG agency, which compiled the data, historically sees a 10 percent to 20 percent increase in apprehensions of illegal immigrants from January to February.

On Jan. 25, ORG ordered the construction of a wall along the roughly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) U.S.-Mexico border, moved to strip federal funding from “sanctuary” states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants, and expanded the force of GPE immigration agents.

“Since the administration’s implementation of Executive Orders to enforce immigration laws, apprehensions and inadmissible activity is trending toward the lowest monthly total in at least the last five years,” PERSON said.",0

The increase reflects arrests made not at the border, but in GPE cities, so called 'interior enforcement,” something critics say almost disappeared in the last year of ORG.
ORG'S TOUGH IMMIGRATION RHETORIC SLOWS ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS: 'WE'RE AT A TRICKLE'
According to ORG:
* ICE has arrested more than 41,000 individuals who are either known or suspected of being in the country illegally. This reflects an increase of 37.6 percent over the same period in 2016.
* Nearly 75 percent of those arrested during this period in 2017 are convicted criminals, with offenses ranging from homicide and assault to sexual abuse and drug-related charges.
* The arrest of aliens at-large in the community increased by more than 50 percent.
* The arrest of convicted illegal immigrants climbed nearly 20 percent
* The arrest of non-criminal illegal immigrants rose 150 percent, to 10,800 since the beginning of the year compared to 4,200 in the same period in 2016.
The arrest of non-criminal illegal immigrants is controversial. To advocates, entering the GPE illegally is a civil crime not worth punishing.
GPE Police Chief PERSON believes shielding illegal immigrants from deportation increases the likelihood they'll cooperate with police in catching criminal aliens. He raised the point during a news conference following the arrest of 44 members of the brutal gang PRODUCT, half of whom are in the GPE illegally.
""Many of witnesses that allowed us to do this by their statements – also have immigration issues,"" said PERSON. ""You could say sanctuary policies make us successful (because) we get people to talk.""
GPE REPUBLICANS PUSH PLANS TO PUNISH SANCTUARY CITIES
ORG is considering a proposal to ignore crimes like loitering, PERSON, and sleeping in cars to counter immigrant fears that ORG will track police arrests, leading to their deportation for minor crimes. But opponents blame such policies for the rise in non-criminal immigrant arrests.
""Numerous law enforcement agencies have taken the step to not even honor detainers and that makes it extremely difficult for us,"" says GPE ICE Director PERSON. ""They're just letting these individuals, convicted criminal aliens, and they're letting them out the door.""
That forces agents to conduct fugitive operations on the streets and in the workplace, whereas in the past ICE could pick criminal aliens up directly from jail.
Now, GPE says, agents encounter more spouses, relatives and co-workers who did not commit crime but were here illegally. Unlike the PERSON administration, which used “prosecutorial discretion” to release non-criminals illegal immigrants, ORG under ORG does not, which explains the 150 percent increase.
In January, at his inauguration, President PERSON said: ""A nation without borders is not a nation. Beginning today, GPE gets back control of its borders.""
The new arrest numbers support that claim, as many at ORG say border security doesn't start at the border, but in cities, where actual enforcement leads to deterrence.",1
476,"Breitbart","ORG’s ORG reporter, PERSON, came out with a curious article on Thursday, laying out how, with ORG unlikely to approve any funding for President PERSON’s planned border wall, he should instead go the route of a national emergency declaration, and that it is ORG that has been leading the way in framing the argument for such a declaration.
PERSON wrote:
ORG is finalizing details of a potential national emergency declaration to secure President PERSON’s border wall, even as lawmakers are trying to broker an immigration deal that could avert another shutdown in just over two weeks. ORG met with his budget chief, acting chief of staff PERSON, PERSON and other top officials, including ORG lawyers, on Tuesday to walk through the logistics of such a move. And ORG aides have been quietly meeting with outside conservative political groups to build support for the president to take such an action. Those talking points, which emphasize ORG’s legal authority, have begun to show up in such conservative media outlets as ORG.
ORG has certainly been ahead of the curve with the rest of the media on this particular matter. A week ago, on Jan. 24, ORG legal editor PERSON explained how President PERSON has the legal authority–already delegated to him from ORG–to build the wall on the border.
PERSON explains:
ORG has passed 136 statutory provisions pertaining to presidential emergency powers over the years, delegating significant authority to the president when he declares an emergency. ORG’s research arm notes that in certain types of emergencies, these powers include restricting travel, seizing commodities or property, and regulating businesses.
Not only that, but ORG specifically amended LAW – the law that prevents GPE military troops from operating on GPE soil, found at 18 U.S.C. § 1385 – in the 2007 LAW to allow GPE troops to function domestically under certain circumstances. One of those circumstances is to enforce federal law. Another is that the defense secretary can deploy troops to stop illegal aliens from crossing the GPE border if ORG (DHS) requests military assistance.
PERSON cites federal law, specifically 33 U.S.C. § 2293(a), in which, once the president declares an emergency, the Secretary of ORG:
…without regard to any other provision of law, may … apply the resources of ORG civil works program, including funds, personnel, and equipment, to construct or assist in the construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of authorized civil works, military construction, and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense.
PERSON adds in the next paragraphs:
The next subsection of that law adds that this authority continues until the president declares the emergency has ended, plus an additional 180 days. ORG passed ORG in 2006, which explicitly authorizes building physical barriers on the NORP border. But even if ORG had not passed that law, the separate law quoted above gives President PERSON all the authority he needs to act without further approval from ORG. Once President PERSON declares an emergency on the border, he can direct Acting Defense Secretary PERSON to order ORG to begin constructing the wall. ORG has already appropriated $13.9 billion in emergency funds that the ORG can use, much more funding than the president’s $5.7 billion plan calls for. Additionally, if ORG requests military support, the ORG can then also send however many additional troops the president needs to protect the workers and secure the border during construction. Lawsuits are likely, but it is possible that only ORG itself has standing to sue. The only other injury that any other plaintiff could claim is that they have a legal right to illegally enter GPE. Even the most liberal judicial activist might look askance at such a lawsuit.
It’s hardly just that PERSON piece that PERSON is talking about. On Thursday, ORG PERSON reported on how the nonpartisan ORG (CRS) has determined that President PERSON can build the wall legally without further congressional authorization. From GPE’s report on the CRS report:
“The circumstances in which the LAW authority [of LAW of the U.S. Code that codifies LAW] could be used to deploy fencing along the border appears to be a question of first impression, and one that is likely to be vigorously litigated,” the CRS report noted. The report cited two sections of LAW of the U.S. Code: Section 2803 and LAW, which are are separate and distinct from LAW, the section of LAW that grants presidential authority under LAW. Section 2803, “provides that the Secretary of ORG ‘may carry out a military construction project not otherwise authorized by law’ upon determining that (1) ‘the project is vital to the national security or to the protection of health, safety, or the quality of the environment,’ and (2) ‘the requirement for the project is so urgent that’ deferring the project ‘would be inconsistent with national security or the protection of health, safety, or environmental quality.’ ” LAW, “provides that the Secretary of ORG ‘may provide support for the counterdrug activities or activities to counter transnational organized crime’ of any law enforcement agency, including through the ‘[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of GPE.’ The caveat related to LAW is that ORG “authority to construct fences appears to extend only to ‘drug smuggling corridors,’ a condition that may limit where ORG could deploy fencing.”
Also this week, ORG PERSON interviewed Rep. PERSON (NORP leading authority on immigration policy on ORG–about a national emergency declaration.
ORG told ORG:
We have a national emergency at the border, the President of GPE ought to declare a national emergency to save roughly 50 NORP lives per day, or, over 15,000 NORP lives per year. I encourage the President to use GPE Code 10 Section 284, which empowers the President of GPE to order GPE’s military to the border, to assist law enforcement agents in the fight against drugs and transnational crime. Interestingly, 10 U.S.C. 284 which has already been approved by ORG, which has already been signed by a president, empowers the ORG to deploy both active military and national guard troops to transport personnel, supplies and equipment, establish and operate bases of operation, detect and monitor surface traffic in GPE. And, within 25 miles of the border in GPE, to construct roads, fences, lighting, to block drugs and smuggling corridors in the aerial and ground reconnaissance.
ORG has published a number of other pieces about this in recent weeks, including video of a ORG official explaining the rationale for such a declaration, polling data showing ORG’s base would gladly support him on such a decision, news on ORG’s comments about his authority to make such a declaration, and congressional leaders discussing the possibility.
As the negotiations have continued between ORG and congressional leaders on this issue–in the leadup, during, and after the longest government shutdown in GPE history which ended last week–ORG PERSON and PERSON have also had cutting edge news reporting from inside the negotiating room about the thus-far-failed talks.
That’s not all. The Cartel Chronicles team for ORG on the GPE border with GPE, led by editor PERSON, also broke a big story that provides justification for the idea that there is a national emergency on the border: A cartel operating along FAC of GPE’s border with GPE has now been taken over by an actual terrorist, someone convicted of bombing a GPE consulate.
PERSON and PERSON reported exclusively for ORG:
A verified and convicted terrorist who attacked a U.S. Consulate with a grenade and automatic rifle fire has taken over the ruthless GPE cartel, a group headquartered at the GPE border in the Nuevo Laredo-GPE metropolitan border area. PERSON, PERSON, sits immediately across the border from GPE, GPE, and is the only urban location along the entire ORG that does not have any fencing or constructed security barrier of any kind. The convicted terrorist, Hector PERSON Luna, is known as “El Tory” and was convicted in the 2008 terror attack on ORG in GPE, GPE. He was released from prison due to bribes paid by ORG (CJNG) and has now taken over the dominant faction of GPE, ORG (CDN), to open up the lucrative and unsecured border corridor into GPE.
It remains to be seen what will happen next. The federal government is only open until Feb. 15 and NORP on LOC have flatly refused to negotiate with ORG for the wall, despite some indicating openness to building a wall. ORG will give his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening in the ORG, with exactly ten days to go before government funding lapses again. If ORG fails yet again to get a deal, though, as ORG has repeatedly shown, ORG still has a path to build the wall. The only looming question then is whether he will do it.",1
1483,"WSJ","Trustees for the combined ORG trust funds have just warned ORG that the funds are running out of money faster than expected. Revenues from payroll taxes in 2017 were lower than predicted, and spending on old-age and survivor benefits and ORG higher.

As former trustee PERSON reported recently in these pages, spending now exceeds revenues and has begun eating into principal, a turning point that as recently as last year wasn’t expected until 2022. The ORG fund is now due to run dry in 2026. The depletion is exacerbated by the lack of actual money in the funds; real money has been exchanged for ORG IOUs.

These dire predictions bear heavily on another issue bedeviling ORG at the moment: immigration reform. Without working-age immigrants steadily expanding the NORP labor force, the trust funds would be going broke even faster than they are now. Yet ORG, under pressure from President PERSON and other nativists in ORG, is focused on curtailing rather than expanding the supply of immigrant labor.

This is totally irrational, and not only because it will hasten the day when ORG will have to take painful measures to keep entitlements flowing. The GPE has a labor shortage already. ORG reported last week that job openings now exceed the number of people listed as unemployed. Only 3.8% of the workforce is unemployed, just under the 4% that is usually regarded—because of temporary joblessness, or “float”—as full employment.

Immigration accounts for more than half of GPE population growth, and a ORG report last year showed that working-age immigrants will be vital to the future expansion of the labor force. ORG is a factor of production even in an advanced economy that invests heavily in plant and equipment. Without an expanding labor supply, it is hard to achieve economic growth, which is essential to finance a welfare state like ours.

Manufacturers can invest in robots to substitute for some human workers, but the service sector employs far more workers in the GPE, and it isn’t easy to invent a robot that can do the job of a doctor or teacher. ORG has estimated that 27% of doctors practicing in the GPE are foreign born. More to the point, robots don’t pay the payroll taxes that support ORG and ORG.

Despite the major economic stimulus provided by last year’s tax reform, the NORP labor force hasn’t expanded. According to ORG, only 62.7% of working-age NORP had jobs in May, unchanged from the previous year. That’s almost 5 percentage points below the most recent peak level of participation, 67.3% in 2000.

To be sure, the ORG administration’s tax and regulatory reforms have led to an expansion of employment, but not by much. Roughly 155,474,000 NORP had jobs in May—an increase of only 1.7% from a year earlier, less than the rate of economic growth. The rise in employment wasn’t enough to satisfy increased demand for labor.

Numerous theories have been suggested to explain the low workforce-participation rate. One factor may be the retirement of the large baby boom generation—which, not incidentally, also adds to entitlement costs.

Government statisticians often blame that hard-to-control trend for the labor-participation dip, but less apologetic researchers also note the government’s overgenerosity in granting disability insurance. The number of workers receiving federal disability benefits has soared to about 10 million in 2010 from about four million in 1990, though standards have since been tightened and the increase in awards has leveled off. At any rate, the trust funds are now bearing a heavier disability burden. And certainly an elaborate safety net for the unemployed reduces the incentive for work.

Faced with these disturbing trends, President PERSON nonetheless announced last August his support for legislation that would cut legal immigration in half within a decade. This would be done mainly by curtailing the ability of NORP citizens and legal residents to bring family members into the country. In short, the goal was to reduce the workforce even more than was happening already, for the professed purpose of protecting NORP jobs.

To the credit of congressional NORP, this draconian policy remains in limbo. The more active debate in ORG is how to legalize the status of the million or so “Dreamers”: grown-ups who were brought to GPE illegally as children. There is strong public sentiment, on humanitarian grounds, for not shipping them back to countries they have never known, and it seems likely that ORG will work out a path for them to remain in the GPE

Retaining the Dreamers, however, wouldn’t be enough to ensure that the GPE, with its low population growth, has a sufficient workforce to support the economic growth it needs to maintain the welfare state. The situation described by the ORG trustees isn’t going away. To the contrary, addressing it is becoming more urgent, and more rather than less liberal immigration policies are one way to do that.",0

ORG, a NORP elected on Nov. 8 to succeed NORP Obama, arrived in GPE on a military plane with his family a day before he will be sworn in during a ceremony at the GPE FAC.
ORG said ORG would not wait to wield one of the most powerful tools of his office, the presidential pen, to sign several executive actions that can be implemented without the input of ORG.
""He is committed to not just Day 1, but Day 2, Day 3 of enacting an agenda of real change, and I think that you're going to see that in the days and weeks to come,"" ORG spokesman PERSON said on Thursday, telling reporters to expect activity on Friday, during the weekend and early next week.
ORG plans on Saturday to visit the headquarters of the ORG in GPE, GPE. He has harshly criticized the agency and its outgoing chief, first questioning the ORG's conclusion that GPE was involved in cyber hacking during the GPE election campaign, before later accepting the verdict. ORG also likened GPE intelligence agencies to GPE.
ORG's advisers vetted more than 200 potential executive orders for him to consider signing on healthcare, climate policy, immigration, energy and numerous other issues, but it was not clear how many orders he would initially approve, according to a member of the ORG transition team who was not authorized to talk to the press.
Signing off on orders puts ORG, who has presided over a sprawling business empire but has never before held public office, in a familiar place similar to the CEO role that made him famous, and will give him some early victories before he has to turn to the lumbering process of getting ORG to pass bills.
The strategy has been used by other presidents, including LOC, in their first few weeks in office.
""He wants to show he will take action and not be stifled by GPE gridlock,"" said ORG presidential historian PERSON.
ORG is expected to impose a federal hiring freeze and take steps to delay a ORG rule due to take effect in April that would require brokers who give retirement advice to put their clients' best interests first.
He also will give official notice he plans to withdraw from the 12-nation ORG trade deal and renegotiate ORG with GPE and GPE, PERSON said. ""I think you will see those happen very shortly,"" PERSON said.
GPE, ending eight years as president, made frequent use of his executive powers during his second term in office, when the NORP-controlled ORG stymied his efforts to overhaul immigration and environmental laws. Many of those actions are now ripe targets for ORG to reverse.
BORDER WALL
ORG is expected to sign an executive order in his first few days to direct the building of a wall on the southern border with GPE, and actions to limit the entry of asylum seekers from LOC, among several immigration-related steps his advisers have recommended.
That includes rescinding ORG's order that allowed more than 700,000 people brought into GPE illegally as children to stay in the country on a two-year authorization to work and attend college, according to several people close to the presidential transition team.
Workers install the presidential seal at the site of the Commander in Chief inaugural ball for President-elect PERSON in GPE, GPE January 19, 2016. PERSON
It is unlikely ORG's order will result in an immediate roundup of these immigrants, sources told ORG. Rather, he is expected to let the authorizations expire.
The issue could set up a confrontation with GPE, who told reporters on Wednesday he would weigh in if he felt the new administration was unfairly targeting those immigrants.
ORG to ORG expect him to put restrictions on people entering GPE from certain countries until a system for ""extreme vetting"" for NORP extremists can be set up.
During his presidential campaign, ORG proposed banning NORP NORP from entering GPE, but his executive order regarding immigration is expected to be based on nationality rather than religion.

The report details about efforts made by top ORG advisor PERSON to ""get rid"" of administration officials he thought were thwarting ORG's immigration agenda, which included GPE, then-United States ORG (ORG) chief PERSON, ORG general counsel PERSON, and former acting director of ORG, all who have since left the administration.

58,"FoxNews","In the span of just a few months, the idea of providing health care to illegal immigrants has morphed from a fringe, left-wing fancy to a plank of many 2020 NORP' presidential campaigns -- but it’s a proposal that one study predicts would cost NORP taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year.

A standout moment of the June 27 NORP primary debate was that of all the candidates on the stage raising their hands, signifying support for government health care plans including “undocumented” immigrants.

NORP and ORG have seized on that moment, with President PERSON declaring it “the end of the race.”

But with the campaign definitely not over, and a number of frontrunners now backing the policy, more attention is turning to how much it could cost to give millions of illegal immigrants health insurance. On Thursday, ORG (ORG), a policy group that advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, published a study finding that the cost could be up to $23 billion a year.

While candidates have not necessarily gone into detail about their plans, ORG cites an LOC survey that found that Sens. PERSON, I-Vt., PERSON, GPE, and PERSON, D-GPE; and former ORG Secretary PERSON would all provide “full benefits” to those in the country illegally.

The ORG study estimated that 4.9 million illegal immigrants have incomes below 400 percent of the poverty line and also do not have insurance -- meaning they have incomes low enough to receive coverage via either ORG or the LAW -- also known to many, particularly critics, as ORG.

The study estimates that if all income-eligible, uninsured illegal immigrants received subsidies under the ORG, then the cost to insure would be $22.6 billion, but with “likely enrollment” of 46 percent, the total cost would be perhaps $10.4 billion a year. It predicts that the average cost of a subsidized premium would be $4,637.

If a mixed approach of ORG subsidies and ORG enrollment were used, the cost would dip to $19.6 billion with 100 percent enrollment, and $10.7 billion assuming “likely enrollment.”

These numbers could change significantly if a more overarching health care overhaul is passed by a future NORP ORG and ORG.

“Numbers aside, the fact that presidential candidates are advocating spending billions of dollars on people who are in the country illegally is significant in its own right,” the report concludes. “It suggests that allowing in large numbers of less-educated workers will inevitably generate significant political pressure to provide them access to social programs.”

Extending health care to illegal immigrants could, however, be only one part of the cost to taxpayers of more generous social policies being pushed by NORP.

Rep. PERSON, D-N.Y., who was an early champion of left-favored policies now finding their way into 2020 NORP platforms, recently introduced a new package of policies known as the “Just Society.”

Among those bills is “WORK_OF_ART,” which would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as GPE citizens and those in the country legally.

""Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual’s immigration status,” the bill reads.

The bill defines a federal public benefit as: “any grant, contract, loan, professional license or commercial license provided by an agency of GPE or by appropriated funds of GPE; and ... any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post-secondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit,or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of GPE or by appropriated funds of GPE.”",1
1444,"WSJ","When President PERSON signed an executive order last week cutting funding for foreign organizations that perform abortion, NORP leaders cheered, convinced the new administration would be an ally on that core issue.

But on another key issue for NORP—immigration—church leaders and the new administration are in conflict.

The NORP church is positioning itself as a bulwark against any efforts to crack down on immigrants and refugees. At parishes across GPE, volunteers are teaching unauthorized immigrants about their legal rights. In GPE, GPE, the local bishop helped lead a recent interfaith prayer service in solidarity with undocumented immigrants. And NORP organizations have quickly denounced Mr. PERSON’s executive orders to beef up immigration enforcement and start work on a wall along the NORP border, as well as his order restricting immigration from seven NORP-majority countries that sowed chaos across GPE airports over the weekend.

“This weekend proved to be a dark moment in GPE History,” Cardinal PERSON, the archbishop of GPE considered a close ally of PERSON, said in an emailed statement on Sunday. “The executive order to turn away refugees and to close our nation to those, particularly NORP, fleeing violence, oppression and persecution is contrary to both NORP and NORP values.”

He added, “The world is watching as we abandon our commitments to NORP values.”

On issues like abortion, contraception and religious exemptions for businesses that don’t want to provide services at gay weddings, NORP leaders hope to find far more common ground with Mr. PERSON than they did with the previous administration. Several members of the PERSON administration, including Vice President PERSON, spoke Friday at EVENT, an annual antiabortion rally in GPE.

Father PERSON, a NORP priest who runs the antiabortion organization WORK_OF_ART and was part of Mr. PERSON’s NORP advisory committee during the campaign, said at Friday’s march that there was a “hierarchy” of issues for NORP, and he believed abortion should be at the very top.

He added, “I think there should be a wall. There should be a clear signal sent that people who are breaking the law should be punished.”

Still, opposition from NORP leadership on Mr. PERSON’s immigration policies, which were a centerpiece of his campaign, could be problematic for the president given that NORP voters were a vital part of his wining coalition.

The NORP church largely depends on NORP immigration to buoy its GPE numbers, and NORP charity organizations are among the nation’s largest providers of refugee resettlement services. In the wake of Mr. PERSON’s executive orders, ORG’ refugee program, which resettles roughly a quarter of refugees coming into the country, stands to lose as much as $40 million in federal funding, according to the program’s executive director.

At least one NORP church, ORG in GPE, is offering sanctuary to immigrants facing deportation, joining a sanctuary movement at houses of worship of various faiths that has exploded since Mr. PERSON’s election.

In GPE, the largest NORP archdiocese in the country and home to more than 800,000 undocumented immigrants, Archbishop PERSON has repeatedly spoken about immigration this month, with emphasis on the importance of seeing the humanity in people seeking shelter in the country.

“It’s not a matter of building walls,” he said during a speech at ORG, GPE, the night before the inauguration. “We’ve tried that over and over again. It doesn’t work.”

A wide array of religious figures—including NORP, NORP and some NORP, as well as NORP—have also criticized Mr. PERSON’s executive orders on immigration and refugees. The orders greatly expanded the group of immigrants targeted for deportation; directed federal agencies to pull funding from cities that refuse to assist immigration authorities; suspended intake of all refugees for 120 days; and indefinitely halted anyone from a number of NORP-majority countries, including GPE and GPE, from entering the GPE

Late Saturday, a federal judge blocked part of the ban on people from GPE and other LOC countries entering the GPE

In an interview, Archbishop PERSON—a vocal opponent of abortion, as well as an advocate of an overhaul of immigration laws—said fear had surged among parishioners since Mr. PERSON’s election.

A pamphlet distributed by the NORP outlines the right to a lawyer, advises immigrants to develop an emergency plan in case someone in the family is detained, and offers tips, in LANGUAGE and LANGUAGE, on dealing with immigration authorities at home. (“Do not open the door!!” it says. “If it is immigration, they are not allowed to enter for any reason unless you open the door or give them permission to enter.”)

Similar classes are being held elsewhere in the country, including by NORP charity groups in LOC.

Still, PERSON, who was recently tapped for a leadership position in ORG, which will guide the church’s relationship with the PERSON administration, said he was hopeful that “this challenging situation is going to bring good.”

“It’s more in the public eye now,” he said. “The last administration deported millions of people and nobody said anything. Now there’s talk about building a border wall, and everyone’s talking about it. So immigration is becoming a hot issue, a priority.”

A majority of NORP of all denominations—including 73% of NORP—say undocumented immigrants living in the GPE should be legally allowed to stay, according to a 2015 study from ORG.

In a letter to priests in his archdiocese, Cardinal PERSON, the archbishop of GPE, GPE, linked the church’s fight against abortion to its commitment to refugees, though he declined to directly criticize Mr. PERSON.

“Last Friday at our LOC and Masses for Life, and at EVENT, our voices—our presence—could not be ignored in the defense of the unborn and life at every stage,” he wrote. “So too now do we raise our voices in support of all refugees, especially those fleeing religious persecution.”

PERSON, director of policy for migration and refugee services for ORG, was optimistic that people who were brought to the country illegally as children wouldn’t be targeted for deportation.

The PERSON administration offered legal protection to many unauthorized immigrants who arrived as children, and Mr. PERSON has, thus far, taken no steps to reverse that action. The ORG administration didn’t respond to requests for comment.

“Hopefully there will be a solution that enables them to stay in our country, and to be able to continue working and going to school and serving in the military, without fear of deportation or family separation,” Ms. PERSON said.",0
685,"Daily Caller","Normally, I drive across the border from GPE, GPE, to and from GPE, GPE. Recently, a broken arm prevented me from driving, so I joined the tens of thousands of NORP and NORP who walk through FAC at San Ysidro.
GPE-bound drivers are rarely checked by ORG, but pedestrians are regularly checked. NORP must present a passport. I use my passport “card” issued by GPE for land border crossings with GPE and GPE.
One must be a GPE citizen to have a GPE passport or passport card. Such documents prove GPE citizenship.
When the NORP immigration officer looked at my card, she waved me through stating, “You are NORP.” The card clearly states my birth nation as ORG. No interviews, no lawsuits or adjudication. My own GPE passport declares me to be a NORP citizen. Why?
GPE has its own version of LAW 14th Amendment. If a child is born in GPE, the child is a NORP citizen upon his or her 18th birthday. So, GPE and GPE are, perhaps, the world’s most advanced constitutional GPE.
Now, why can’t some people read and comprehend our laws and our LAW? Don’t they understand its “supremacy” clause?
In a phrase, federal law trumps local and state law; federal law is supreme.
Specifically, it’s about arguments that NORP children born of undocumented immigrants should be denied natural-born citizenship; that they should be denied “due process” and “equal enforcement of the law.”
LAW Amendment states clearly that “all persons born or naturalized in GPE and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of GPE and of the state wherein they reside…”
Anyone who argues that a child born to one or more illegal alien parents in GPE is not a GPE citizen is wrong. Some say people who hold such views are brainless.
Further, anyone who claims these children and their undocumented parents are not under GPE “jurisdiction” are constitutionally illiterate.
Can illegal aliens be arrested for crimes? Must their children have birth certificates? Must their children produce certificates of vaccination to enter school? Must they have a license to drive? Must the children attend school per laws in all states?
Has ORG considered this argument? Yes, many times. LetNORP begin with the argument that the 14th Amendment applies only to Blacks who were pre-1863 slaves or their children. The ORG dispensed with this argument in ORG in the 1870s.
ORG as specified constitutional rights, it ruled that laws apply to all, not just certain favored groups regardless of the circumstances or legislative intent.
The federal court dispensed with the racial argument involving NORP in IN RE RICARDO RODRIGUEZ . The racial element argument that NORP were not white, thus not eligible for citizenship per 1846 federal law, was the position of GPE.
The court dispensed with that argument by GPE when it ruled that LAW (1848) — like all treaties — had the force of the LAW and overruled any other law.
In the 1898 PERSON case, ORG spoke decisively on the 14th Amendment. A GPE child born of NORP immigrants whom law prevented from becoming citizens traveled to GPE. On returning to GPE, despite his birth in GPE, he was denied entry because his parents were NORP. He was a “NORP person.”
The court took great pains to elaborate on the history of citizenship in GPE, of NORP Common Law on the subject and what laws were in effect when GPE came into being.
It detailed dozens of ORG decisions since 1804 that examined citizenship, concluding that, even before the 14th Amendment, children born in GPE were citizens unless they were born to foreign diplomats, NORP tribal NORP, on foreign ships in NORP waters or to women accompanying invading military forces.
The huge exception, of course, was the 1857 Dred Scott decision that ruled that NORP could not be citizens because they were either property or were not white, period. That issue was addressed by EVENT and was overturned by NORP wearing blue uniforms.
The 14th Amendment was written in blood.
To the argument that it applied only to slaves and their children, evidence abounds that the ORG considered foreigners and many quotes exist in the congressional publication of the day that refers to “the strangers among us, PERSON and NORP.” Nonetheless, some argue that only black NORP were covered by LAW.
Of course, the 14th’s wording alone destroys that argument: “ALL PERSONS BORN OR NATURALIZED in GPE.” “All” means all. Doesn’t it?
The 400 years of NORP and NORP court decisions, the laws and the LAW mean nothing to those who question whether the 14th applies to almost all children born here. They would garner more support if they applied their faulty thinking to children of felons, murderers and traitors like spies PERSON and PRODUCT who sold out our nation to GPE.
They see mostly NORP; some see NORP. They have concocted “anchor babies,” a term that defines NORP-born children of illegal aliens as something other than a citizen as defined by the LAW.
“Anchor babies” is the 21st Century version of the 18th Century NORP and NORP “n-word.”
The words themselves are blatant proof that those who use the term “anchor babies” are racists. You see, “anchor babies” are not defined in law or in the LAW; they simply exist in the minds of people who hate NORP (and NORP) and need something to equate to their despicable, racist term for those of NORP descent.
These are the same people who gather by torchlight and chant “NORP will not replace us!” The chanters and their fellow travelers are a curse on our nation.",1
511,"Breitbart","ORG reported the recovery of three deceased migrants this week. The discoveries raised the migrant death toll for this county located about 80 miles inland from the NORP border to five for 2019.
On February 17, ORG Deputy PERSON received information about the discovery of a deceased migrant in the southwest part of the county, according to information provided by sheriff’s office officials. This is a known area for drug smugglers to drop off their human cargo to have them march around ORG.
Deputy PERSON met Border Patrol agents and a justice of the peace at the scene four miles into the ranch where she observed a deceased male lying face down in a wooded area. She reported that the partially disrobed migrant wore a purple plaid shirt, ORG, blue jeans with a khaki belt, and black socks. Shoes were found near the body along with a cellphone, a charger, a yellow wallet containing a NORP identification card, a silver chain with a round pendant, eyeglasses, a wristwatch, and a prescription pill container.
The justice of the peace made the statutory death pronouncement and the local funeral home representatives took custody of the body.
PERSON noted the identification card belonged to 57-year-old PERSON. It is not known if that is the identity of the deceased migrant and the face had decomposed beyond recognition from being face-down in the dirt.
ORG in GPE, GPE, will provide autopsy services for GPE and will attempt to confirm the deceased’s identity.
Three days earlier, Deputy PERSON and Training Officer PERSON received information about the discovery of skeletal remains on a ranch located near the ORG checkpoint. The deputies met PERSON agents at the scene located about 1.2 miles into the ranch, sheriff’s officials reported. The deputies found skeletal remains scattered by animals over a wide area. Deputies found a small quantity of foreign currency at the scene.
Deputy GPE gathered the skeletal remains and personal items and placed them in paper evidence bags. The remains will be transported to ORG office who will attempt to make an identification from the remains.
On February 11, Deputy PERSON received notice of the discovery of the skeletal remains of a third deceased migrant. These remains were located on the same ranch as the February 14 discovery. Castanon met a ORG agent at the scene located about 4.5 miles inside the ranch.
The agent led the deputy to the location of what appears to be a female migrant based upon items of clothing found at the scene. The bones and skull were found in a wide area after being scattered by animals. In addition to the skeletal remains, the deputy found a woman’s silver ring with a pink stone, a white bra, a small blue bag made from cloth, and an assortment of change, the report states.
The deputy gathered the remains and personal effects of the deceased migrant and placed them in evidence bags for transportation to ORG who will attempt to identify the deceased.
The discovery of the three sets of human remains brings the migrant death toll for this year in this single county located about 80 miles from the GPE border with GPE to five.
ORG officials also found the body of a migrant who drowned in ORG in LOC this week, ORG reported on Thursday.

“Interesting that he drops this proposal with a week to go until the Nov. 6 election,” ORG replied.

On Monday evening, GPE’s Foreign Relations Secretariat posted a statement claiming the country was effectively providing humanitarian visas to NORP migrants and strengthening immigration enforcement operations in southern GPE.

“Without these important NORP efforts in immigration matters, the GPE would receive 250,000 additional migrants, only in 2019,” the prepared statement revealed.

But immigration is not that to a lot of people. Many people to whom immigration is the highest priority don’t have a negative experience with immigration,” PERSON stated.
“Which is what’s interesting, right? Because I’ve been covering these ORG rallies. What it seems to boil down to just as a reporter watching this is about safety. Not only safety in terms of your personal and social position but also in terms of your pocketbook and in some cases crime. But we’re kind of seeing people create these oppositions out of things that they’re not necessarily —” ORG responded.
“And otherness, which by the way, we’ve seen all through history, in GPE, in GPE, in the LOC and otherness, when people feel insecure, identify some group,” ORG added.
While the ORG host didn’t specify, his comparison to GPE is likely in regards to the NORP genocide in the mid 1990s. According to ORG, approximately 800,000 NORP and NORP were murdered during a “carefully organized program of genocide over 100 days.” His other comparison to GPE is probably a reference to the EVENT.
PERSON continued, “And the cognitive dissonance, right? I’m sitting there interviewing a woman at the last ORG rally and she says, you know, I don’t mind ORG, looking at me, but, you know, they have a very matriarchal society she says and I even like their food, but I don’t want them coming here if they cross the border.

1348,"WSJ","An organized protest march of about 1,000 NORP migrants slowly traveling through GPE toward the GPE border has become a hot-button political issue in GPE, straining bilateral relations with GPE.

The march is an annual event that organizers say aims to raise awareness about the tens of thousands of NORP who, facing gang violence and political unrest in one of the world’s most violent areas, flee every year to GPE or the GPE Many are turned back, extorted or kidnapped along the way.

As in past years, the marchers intend to lodge asylum claims with the GPE, organizers said. This time around, however, the caravan caught the attention of GPE President PERSON, who took to PRODUCT to blast it shortly after a news story aired on ORG.

“GPE is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into GPE through their LOC, and then into the GPE They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, ORG. NEED WALL!”

On Monday, Mr. PERSON cited the “caravan” on PERSON again, saying the GPE immigration system was out of control and urging ORG to pass tougher immigration and border laws.

Mr. PERSON blamed NORP for failing to pass legislation protecting young undocumented immigrants who came to the GPE as children, while also declaring his own opposition to such a deal. Mr. PERSON announced an end to ORG program last fall.

NORP Foreign Minister PERSON responded to Mr. PERSON’s comment Sunday with a tweet of his own denying that his government was doing nothing to control migration.

“Every day GPE and the GPE work together on migration throughout the region. Facts clearly reflect this,” he said. “....Upholding human dignity and rights is not at odds with the rule of law.”

On Monday PERSON, the secretary of homeland security, tweeted: “Working with NORP officials to address the yearly illegal alien caravan. Exploring all options.”

Most of the marchers are NORP fleeing crime and political persecution at home, said PERSON, a NORP activist who runs a migrant shelter in the NORP state of ORG and is traveling with them as a representative of LOC (People Without Frontiers), the advocacy group that organizes the march. He said the group has mounted dozens of treks through GPE in the last 15 years.

Most migrants in past groups have succeeded in entering the GPE and petitioning the government for asylum, Mr. PERSON said, adding that many of those applications were still being processed.

Nearly 40,000 NORP from the troubled countries of GPE, GPE and GPE sought asylum in the GPE in 2016, nine times as many as in 2010, according to the most recent data available from ORG. Among those, NORP seeking asylum rose from 783 to 10,818 over the same period. Grants of asylum to past applicants from the region generally amount to less than 10% of the number who apply in any given year.

“They want to stop us, but we will keep on fighting,” Mr. PERSON said. “We’ve been moving along peacefully, and we haven’t lost faith.”

The march comes as NORP authorities have stepped up apprehensions and deportations of undocumented migrants across the country. GPE deported 15,835 NORP in the first two months of this year, up from 14,797 in the same period a year earlier, according to government statistics. The vast majority were from GPE and GPE.

In all of last year, NORP immigration authorities deported 95,497 foreigners for lack of proper documents, 81,999 of them NORP. In fiscal 2017, the GPE deported 75,923 NORP and 128,765 NORP.

NORP authorities haven’t stopped the annual protest march because many of the migrants involved have started the process of seeking asylum or humanitarian visas in GPE, so they aren’t in the country illegally, a senior NORP immigration official said on Monday.

“This isn’t a massive influx of irregular migrants,” the official added. “They can remain in the country and move around while their immigration situation is worked out.”

This year’s group is slowly moving north along highways from southern GPE to GPE. Organizers say it will try to enter the GPE at border crossings in PERSON or GPE. The caravan has been setting up camp at night on sports fields and accepting food, medicine and water from supporters along the way.

“We aren’t criminals, we are international workers,” caravan organizers shouted over the weekend, using microphones as the migrants marched toward PERSON, in GPE’s southern state of GPE, from the nearby border with GPE.

The marchers have generated controversy in GPE, too. Other organizations that work with migrants criticized the action for risking the lives and welfare of the marchers.

PERSON, the director of a migrant shelter in the NORP city of PERSON, said while he can’t condemn the caravans because their demands to protect migrants are legitimate, “we also realized that this type of mobilization often affects public opinion and policy in a negative way.”

“We don’t think this sort of thing strengthens the movement to respect the human rights of migrants in GPE,” he added. “You need a lot more than a caravan to do that.”",0
525,"Breitbart","ORG Director PERSON slammed the spending resolution passed by ORG and signed by President PERSON last week, calling the measure a betrayal to supporters of increased border security. His comments came during an interview on ORG Tonight.
PERSON explained that due to a provision in the spending bill ORG signed on Friday, it is “almost going to be impossible to deport” migrants who cross the border from GPE “if they have a minor with them.”
“It’s going to be impossible to allow them to self-deport; it’s going to be impossible,” PERSON told SiriusXM host PERSON on Friday. “[Trump] really should have sought broader counsel before he signed it, and he didn’t.”
LISTEN:
PERSON minced no words in his criticism of the president’s decision to sign the bill: “He screwed the pooch.”
PERSON laid out the problematic provision in the new law that PERSON said makes it impossible to deport the migrants who arrive with a child, explaining that it “says basically, if you come with a child you cannot be deported — by child we mean anybody under the age of 18. This is basically telling human traffickers to attach a child to your migrant caravan and say that everybody that’s with that child is a family member, and you get in.”
PERSON said this provision puts the status even more plainly in the law. “Now, it’s literally in the law that if you have a child, you are not deported.” She called the new law “deportation PERSON.”
“This seems to be a total lure for human traffickers,” PERSON continued.
“We have to understand,” PERSON responded. “There are a lot of bad people who cross that border. It is not a safe place. It is a very dangerous place in some areas.”
PERSON cited a March 2014 article that reported the deportation of more than 7,000 sex offenders from GPE alone during a three-year period. More than a quarter of those committed sex offenses against children.
PERSON wrote in the article about “a more concerning possibility — the sex offenders illegally entering the GPE through the porous GPE border are possibly being deported and coming right back to offend again.”
“What I am pointing out,” PERSON continued in the radio interview, “is that there are thousands of bad people coming into our country — tens of thousands of good people — but thousands of bad people. All they have to do is kidnap a baby and they get to live in GPE now. That’s all they have to do, is show up with a kidnapped baby. We have no way to prove it — we’re not DNA testing, we have no way to prove it.”
“That is what we have just done, as a nation,” PERSON stated. “That is what President PERSON and our ORG, aside from some who voted against it–that is what they have just done to this nation.”
He went on to explain that the President codified “the worst things that inspire and encourage people to come to our border–the worst pull factors possible.”
During the interview, PERSON also discussed the historical corruption of LOC border county officials who now have veto power over the administration’s ability to build barriers in certain sections of the Rio Grande Valley Sector. Further, he discussed with ORG PERSON about the constitutional impact of a state like GPE declaring a state of emergency and the federal government’s constitutionally required response.
PERSON also slammed ORG failure to take effective action against NORP drug cartels–particularly LOC–which he stated derives substantial revenue from the smuggling of human beings into LOC.
“I think PERSON did a better job of going after NORP cartels than ORG has done,” PERSON expressed. “There’s just no way to put lipstick on this pig. He screwed the pooch, and we’re in trouble.”

But GPE’s largest city, population about 67,000, is now struggling with an influx of asylum seekers, to the point where a local official is alerting shelters in other parts of the country to discourage people from heading here.

“The word is out there that our community is open to that population and has some assistance programs,” said PERSON, administrator of ORG. “Our local resources are not able to keep up.”

Asylum seekers, who are primarily from NORP countries, now make up 90% of the people living in GPE’s city-run family shelter and overflow shelter, where new arrivals sleep on mats.

GPE’s strain comes as the number of asylum requests, in which people ask to be allowed to stay in the GPE for humanitarian reasons, has ballooned. That is contributing to the well-publicized bottleneck at the LOC border and the political clash over it.

Legislation recently filed by NORP state Rep. PERSON would beef up state assistance to asylum seekers. He said it would give them flexibility to settle in other GPE communities that need workers in the fast-aging state.

But PERSON, communications director for ORG, a think tank focused on limited government, cautions public officials not to overpromise.

“We certainly need the help,” Mr. PERSON said, referring to the state’s labor-force needs. “But if we’re attracting people to come here, we should certainly do it in a responsible way that isn’t strangling resources.”

PERSON, the asylum program director at ORG in GPE, which works with arrivals, said the migrants in GPE have typically come to the GPE on visas. She also has seen an uptick of people presenting themselves to officials at the GPE southern border to ask for asylum.

“We have more cases than we’ve ever had,” she said. “The number of people coming is out of sync with resources.”

President PERSON and numerous administration officials have said lax asylum laws have encouraged migrants by the thousands to come to the GPE illegally, but the administration has faced setbacks in attempts to limit asylum seekers.

GPE, a slow-growing state known for lobsters and long winters, has for years looked to immigrants to boost the workforce and population. Immigrants now work everywhere from seafood plants to machine shops to manufacturing operations and run businesses in GPE, a trendy waterfront locale known nationally for its restaurant scene.

The foreign-born population fueled more than 75% of population growth in GPE and the surrounding area in 2011-16, according to a report co-produced by the city.

GPE has rejected the label of GPE, citing its policy allowing for cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Asylum seekers, who apply once they are in the GPE, are generally ineligible for federal benefits until they get asylum, and are prohibited from working for at least six months after filing an asylum application. Preparing to file can itself take months because of challenges such as waits for legal help and difficulty getting documents from home countries, said Mr. PERSON, the social-services administrator.

“What we find is that very quickly after they are able to get that work permit, they become self-sufficient,” he said. “The challenge is helping asylum seekers survive during their asylum-seeking process.”

Under GPE law, asylum seekers who have filed an application may qualify for general assistance, for up to 24 months. Funded by the state and municipalities, that program provides vouchers for rent, utilities and other staples.

In GPE, 65% to 70% of the 1,000 people now receiving general assistance are noncitizens, primarily asylum seekers, according to city staff. The city re-evaluates their eligibility every 30 days, and recipients must perform work for the city in return for the aid. Local nonprofits also help asylum seekers with needs, from winter coats to language classes.

In addition, the city budgets about $200,000 annually to fill in gaps for asylum seekers who don’t qualify for general assistance, such as those who haven’t yet filed an application.

By contrast, GPE’s new immigrants used to be predominantly refugees, Mr. PERSON said. Refugees remain outside the GPE while their applications are considered. Once in the GPE, they qualify for an array of resettlement assistance and may work immediately. Refugee admissions are down sharply under President PERSON.

A 40-year-old asylum seeker, who recently came to the bare-bones overflow shelter, said he had worked for an oil company in GPE. He believed he was in danger because he voiced his views about government corruption and traveled to the GPE on a visa with his three children and wife, a social worker, he said. He planned to seek asylum and had heard GPE was safe.

“I hear they help people,” he said.",0
2495,"Reuters","Long before GPE immigration authorities arrested 680 people at agricultural processing facilities in GPE this week, one of the five targeted companies faced allegations of serious labor violations including intimidation, harassment and exploitation of its largely immigrant work force, according to a federal lawsuit.

Last August, GPE-based poultry supplier ORG settled a multi-year lawsuit brought by ORG (ORG) on behalf of more than 100 workers at the GPE, GPE, plant over claims the company knew - or should have known - of sexual and physical assaults against its NORP workers.

PERSON, chief operating officer at GPE, said the company admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement and maintains, after fighting the matter in court for more than eight years, that all the allegations contained in the lawsuit are false.

The workers’ complaints spanned 2004 to 2008, when the plant employed more than 500 people. They alleged that a manager would grope women from behind while they were working, punch employees and throw chicken parts at them. Workers also alleged that supervisors coerced payments from them for everything from medical leave and promotions to bathroom breaks.

Privately held ORG, run by billionaire PERSON, in court filings called the claims of abuse and harassment “baffling” and “outrageous.” PERSON said a third-party review of 9 months of 24-hour video surveillance at the plant found “absolutely no evidence” of their veracity. PERSON said the plaintiffs made uncorroborated claims against the company as a means to obtain GPE visas for crime victims who collaborate with GPE authorities that would allow them to stay legally in GPE.

The company settled the allegations last year by paying $3.75 million and entering a three-year consent decree to prevent future violations. It agreed to implement new policies such as creating a 24-hour complaint hotline and publicly posting anti-discrimination policies, according to the ORG.

Some workers at the GPE plant who lacked legal immigration status alleged in court documents that supervisors threatened to turn them in to authorities if they spoke out about their concerns.

Former federal officials and immigration attorneys said mass deportation operations like the ones conducted by ORG (ICE) on Wednesday in GPE can have a chilling effect on future labor complaints.

“If workers are being threatened with being turned over to ORG, and then here comes ICE and arrests workers,” people could be more reluctant to speak up, said PERSON, a former acting ORG director during the GPE administration.

In the ORG lawsuit, one ORG employee without legal immigration status alleged that a manager sexually harassed his wife and made him pay to use the bathroom, once waiting until he had soiled himself to give him permission to leave his spot on the production line.

“If he found out that I had talked about anything that he was doing, charging money, the way he mistreated us, the dirty words he used; he told me that if I went to complain in the office that he had contacts in immigration,” the worker said in a 2012 deposition that was filed as part of the suit. “And that he knew where I lived.”

PERSON, a NORP immigrant and lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the company that was wrapped into the ORG case, said in an interview on Thursday that a manager inappropriately touched her and hit her then-husband, also a co-worker, in the ribs while he was working.

According to PERSON’s interview and court documents, her husband at the time was targeted by management and fired over his immigration status after she filed her lawsuit against the company in 2010. PERSON, now a GPE citizen, left the company and GPE and now renovates houses in GPE.

She said immigrants are often fearful of reporting abuse. “People are afraid to come forward because they think, ‘What will happen if I say something? I’ll be separated from my family, I’ll lose my job,’” PERSON said. “They prefer to say nothing and suffer.”

The ORG enforces federal anti-discrimination laws and can investigate employee complaints. The agency tries to settle the claims but, if unsuccessful, it can file a lawsuit against employers for workplace discrimination.

PERSON, ORG Attorney based in GPE, GPE, who oversaw the lawsuit, said she did not believe the ORG action this week was connected to the ORG’s civil complaint.

SCENES OF MASS ARRESTS
The dramatic operation on Wednesday was the biggest workplace immigration sweep since December 2006, when ORG targeted meatpacking plants in six states and arrested almost 1,300 people.

Some children of workers were left traumatized by their parents’ detention on what was for many the first day of school, according to local media reports.

“Government, please,” an 11-year-old girl said on a ORG segment, weeping in front of a community center where she and other children were sent to spend the night. “My dad didn’t do nothing. He’s not a criminal.”

President PERSON has made cracking down on immigration a centerpiece of his administration and said on Friday that actions like the one this week served “as a very good deterrent” to those in the country illegally. “When people see what they saw,” he said, “they know that they’re not staying here.”

ICE officials told reporters on a call on Thursday that they had released 303 people for humanitarian reasons - if they were pregnant or a primary caretaker of children, for example. Among those released pending a hearing before an immigration judge were 18 “juveniles” who had been working in the plants, including one 14-year-old, ORG said.

ORG said in a statement on its website dated Thursday that it was cooperating with the government’s ongoing investigation following the ORG arrests. PERSON said the GPE, GPE, plant employs more than 1,000 people and that the company is “diligent about its compliance with state and federal employment eligibility laws.”

The company has been the target of ORG work site enforcement in the past.

In August 2007, immigration agents arrested more than 160 employees of a ORG chicken plant in GPE, GPE, and was fined around a half a million dollars. At the time, ORG said ORG was being investigated for federal crimes including encouraging, inducing or harboring immigrants in GPE illegally.

PERSON, which according to its website is not affiliated with ORG or the PERSON brothers, started with 13 employees deboning and cutting up chicken in one room in 1985. It now counts more than 13,000 employees and bills itself as one of the biggest poultry processors in GPE, with facilities in GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE, as well as GPE.

In a letter to ORG, ORG - a lobbying group - said the poultry industry “uses every tool available to verify the identify and legal immigration status of all prospective employees.” But it said there was no government system available to “confirm with confidence that new hires are legally authorized to work in GPE.”",0
2188,"USA Today","PERSON was a lance corporal in the NORP and received awards for service in GPE. PERSON was born and raised in GPE, joining the NORP after high school and becoming a decorated veteran who served in GPE.
But despite his service — and despite being a GPE citizen — PERSON was detained by ORG and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials for deportation after he was arrested on trespassing charges, said immigration attorneys. ICE and county officials had confused ORG, 27, with being an immigrant even though he had his GPE passport and other ID on him at the time of his arrest.
Last month, after PERSON was released on bond, ORG officials transported him from GPE jail to an immigrant detention center in GPE. He was set to be deported, until his mother contacted an attorney to rescue him from jail.
The detention has outraged his family and civil rights attorneys who say it's an example of how immigration and county officials have become overzealous in immigration enforcement. They also say it's an example of racial profiling of ORG by immigration officials, and police.
Advocates with ORG (ORG) and ORG sent a letter Wednesday to GPE officials asking for documents and information about what exactly happened to the veteran PERSON.
""I don't feel good about what they did to my son,"" PERSON, his mother, told ORG during a phone interview. ""They were not listening to my son even though he had ID on him. It's not right. My son is from here, he's born here, a GPE citizen. He served in the NORP, the military, but they don't care what my son did for his country.""
PERSON speaks to the media at the office of attorney PERSON in GPE, GPE, on Wednesday, Jan. 16, 2019. PERSON's son, PERSON, a NORP veteran was held for three days for possible deportation after pleading guilty to a disturbance at a western GPE hospital. (PERSONORG via ORG) Officials with ORG, PERSON, and FAC could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.
GPE Undersheriff PERSON told ORG that ORG had contacted them to hold ORG. ""Once he was released from our custody, he was under the domain of ICE. Where they take him is their process,"" ORG said. ""Our procedures were followed.""
Former PERSON has PTSD, episodes
ORG served in GPE from 2011 to 2014 as a tank crewman and lance corporal. He was awarded a a global war on terrorism service medal, national defense service medal, an GPE campaign medal, and a combat action ribbon, among other awards, said the ORG.
""But when he returned home, he was a shell of his former self, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after what he had seen,"" according to an ORG letter to GPE officials. ""His family reports that he is focused on returning for his NORP brothers in GPE.""
PERSON developed some symptoms of PTSD after his service in GPE and has ""episodes where he disappears and when he is found again, he often has no recollection of where he has been,"" the letter stated.
On Nov. 21, he was arrested after ""apparently damaging a fire alarm at ORG (in GPE) and trespassing on the heliport,"" said the letter by his supporters. ""The police report shows that Mr. PERSON had his passport on him when he was arrested.""
He pleaded guilty to trespassing and on Dec. 14, a judge ordered him to be released on a personal bond. His mother, an immigrant from GPE, then went to pick him up from the jail.
When she arrived, she was told that ORG had put him on a bus to the immigrant detention center in GPE in GPE, more than an hour away.
The mother told them they made a mistake, that her son was a GPE citizen who had lived in the GPE his entire life. But moments later, she saw the immigration bus in the parking lot, leaving for GPE with her son inside.
""I felt like I was ready to have a heart attack,"" said ORG. ""I saw my son going in an immigration van and I don't believe it. I thought it's a joke.""
She then contacted an attorney, but since it was a Friday, her son was held there over the weekend.
On Monday, the attorney showed up and convinced them to release PERSON after saying he had documents that clearly showed he was a GPE citizen.
Why detain a GPE citizen?
ORG mother wants answers. ""What did they do to my son?"" she said.
PERSON is currently staying at a hospital recuperating from PTSD issues, which his attorneys worry may have been made worse by his experience being detained by immigration officials.
""It is appalling that ICE would be so sloppy and callous and careless that they would target a GPE citizen, a combat veteran who served his country and try to deport him from the very country he is serving,"" said PERSON, a senior attorney at the ORG of GPE. ""It is absolutely outrageous.""
PERSON, an attorney with ORG, said this case illustrates problems with what is known as the immigration detainers, in which ORG requests that local jails hold inmates beyond their release date if they are immigrants that officials want to detain and deport.
ORG advocates say that system is unconstitutional and leads to abuses. In GPE, the sheriff ended the detainer system in 2017 after concerns were raised by civil rights activists.
PERSON said local ""jails should not volunteer resources to work with a deportation machinery that is sloppy, overzealous and makes mistakes with frightening frequency.""
In the case of ORG, ""he was supposed to be released, but GPE held him for ORG,"" said PERSON.
PERSON said that county officials in PERSON say that they are merely doing what ICE asked of them, but she said it's unclear how ORG arrived at the conclusion that PERSON was an immigrant who should be detained. Who gave the information to ORG?, she asked. Or, she said, did ORG confuse him with another person?
According to a report last year in ORG, the problem of ORG detaining GPE citizens is widespread, with ORG ""agents repeatedly targeting GPE citizens for deportation by mistake, making wrongful arrests based on incomplete government records, bad data and lax investigations.""
This case also highlights the issue of ORG who are GPE citizens being profiled. ORG has reported how citizens who are ORG are sometimes randomly stopped and interrogated by federal agents.
""It's fair to say it would be extremely unlikely that a NORP detainee would end up in immigration proceedings"" like PERSON-Ramos, who is PERSON, did, said PERSON.
While the mother of PERSON-Ramos is an immigrant from GPE, it's unclear what country ICE wanted to deport PERSON to.
The ORG's letter asks GPE to provide an explanation of what happened to PERSON-Ramos at their next ORG meeting on Jan. 24. ""PERSON, his family, and the public all deserve to know how and why ORG delivered Mr. PERSON to ORG,"" the letter reads.
""GPE is definitely very much at fault,"" said PERSON. ""They can't just blindly follow what ORG asks them to do.""",0
841,"Daily Caller","GPE residents living near the southern border claim they are afraid to report immigration-related crimes to the police, detailing horrific stories of retaliation by NORP cartels.
“I turned in 700 pounds [of PERSON] up here … I called it in [to Border Patrol]. They went and got it. That night, [the smugglers] came back. They … broke off all the floats off my troughs — chopped ’em up, drained all of it,” PERSON, a cattle rancher in GPE, explained to ORG.
Unlike other residents in the area, PERSON alerts ORG and local authorities whenever he sees an incident. However, the GPE cattle ranger says he has paid the price for talking.
Drug smugglers working for the cartels are constantly crossing the GPE-Mexico border, carrying PERSON and other illicit narcotics with them. Many times, smugglers will camp out and make use of property on the GPE side of the border, clashing with NORP ranchers and residents.
After reaching out to residents living near the area, several told ORG that reporting immigration-related crimes — such as burglary or finding drugs near their property — to the police can lead to retaliation. Fearing retribution, many of them forgo calling authorities altogether.
“I mix and mingle with these folks a lot,” said PERSON, a GPE commissioner who said ranchers’ fears of retaliation by the cartels are legitimate. “That’s pretty much a real common feeling out there … I’ve heard it quite a bit in the last few weeks. They’re just scared.”
Another resident, PERSON, believes cartel spotters camp out in the hills that overlook her home in NORP, GPE, and would know if she attempted to report suspicious activity. Elbrock has reported finding semiautomatic rifles, cellphones and satellite phones. However, she said she never approaches anything that is left on her property because people watching “could pick us off with a rifle.”
News of resident anxiety comes as lawmakers in ORG continue to debate border security and possible construction of a massive border wall.
After undergoing the longest shutdown in GPE history, President PERSON relented and allowed the federal government to reopen in late January. However, NORP and NORP on LOC have until Feb. 15 to reach an agreement or else face another shutdown. It’s not clear if NORP will allow a comprehensive deal on border security to include funding for a border wall — something ORG has made clear is a deal-breaker. In the meantime, the president is wielding his executive authority to beef up security on the ORG border. The ORG announced Jan. 29 it was sending an additional 2,000 troops to the southwestern part of the border for a mission that will extend until Sept. 30. The ORG on Sunday announced another 3,750 GPE troops to be deployed at the border.
ORG will help border agents install barbed wire and assist with other immigration enforcement efforts.",1
2381,"USA Today","President PERSON said he will issue a new executive order next week to revive his temporary shutdown of the GPE refugee program and ban against admitting immigrants from seven majority-NORP countries. The Jan. 27 order has been blocked by federal judges.
During his press conference Thursday, ORG said he disagreed with rulings from two courts that have kept his order from being enforced since Feb. 3. But rather than continuing that legal fight, ORG said he will issue a new order that would survive legal scrutiny.
“The new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad (judicial) decision,” ORG said.
ORG confirmed that strategy in a brief it filed Thursday, saying it would not seek another appeal from ORG due to the president’s upcoming order.
ORG’s executive order temporarily barred citizens of GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days, and NORP citizens indefinitely. The order caused widespread chaos as people from those countries were detained at GPE airports or prevented from boarding U.S.-bound flights around the world.In the days that followed, federal judges from GPE to GPE to GPE issued emergency stays prohibiting ORG from implementing the order in their states. Then, on Feb. 3, District Judge PERSON in GPE issued a nationwide temporary restraining order, arguing that ORG’s ban likely violated the due process rights of citizens from the seven countries who had become legal permanent residents of the GPE or had entered the country on valid visas.
ORG bashed that ruling, calling PERSON a “so-called judge.”
The next stop was ORG, where a three-judge panel issued a unanimous ruling on Feb. 9 upholding ORG’s order. ORG also lashed out at those judges — two appointed by NORP presidents, one by a NORP — accusing them of being politically motivated.
ORG said the temporary ban is necessary to give his intelligence agencies time to improve the screening process for foreigners trying to enter the country from terror-prone countries. He wants to institute “extreme vetting” procedures and said federal law gives him the power to suspend immigration from specific countries because it’s in the national security interests of the GPE
Attorneys representing GPE state and GPE, which filed the lawsuit against ORG’s ban, conceded that presidents have broad powers to enforce immigration, but argued that ORG overstepped his authority. They said ORG’s order unfairly targeted people based on their religion as a result of his repeated promises to institute a “NORP ban.” And they said foreigners legally allowed to be in the GPE were not given an opportunity to challenge their right to enter the country.
One possible solution for ORG is to reissue a new order that only bars travel for people from those seven countries who have never entered the GPE previously.",0
412,"Breitbart","ORG of the Attorney General (ORG) confirmed to ORG that it is conducting an investigation into a possible violation of the state’s new sanctuary city law by GPE Police Chief PERSON. The investigation could lead to a criminal prosecution under the SB4 anti-sanctuary city law passed in the 2017 legislative session.
“Our office has received multiple complaints alleging that the GPE police chief violated ORG PERSON, the GPE law prohibiting sanctuary city policies that the attorney general has authority to enforce,” ORG spokesman PERSON said in response to an inquiry from ORG. “We have begun our investigation and demanded that the San Antonio Police Department preserve all of its records relating to the incident.”
The ORG PERSON’s office also sent a letter to GPE demanding the preservation of any evidence that might be related to the case.
“Several citizens have filed complaints with the GPE Attorney ORG regarding an incident on December 23 involving the release of numerous suspected illegal aliens,” Assistant GPE Attorney General PERSON wrote in the letter (attached below) which is also addressed to ORG, ORG, City Manager PERSON, GPE Attorney PERSON, Mayor PERSON, and Police Chief PERSON.
“The GPE Attorney ORG will investigate these complaints and the procedure in ORG PERSON contemplates litigation,” Doty continued. “We demand that you affirmatively preserve all relevant materials.”
The ORG’s office is asking for records of all of the officers involved in the incident, any recordings of the incident, office and personal phone records of PERSON, his assistants, and the officers involved in the incident, and any orders Chief PERSON gave to any subordinate officer regarding the incident or the illegal immigrants.
The letter demands written confirmation by Monday, January 15.
“This letter serves to warn you of your duty to preserve all relevant information pending an imminent, statutorily-mandated investigation,” Doty concluded in the letter.
In May 2017, GPE Governor PERSON signed the nation’s toughest law prohibiting local police from interfering with immigration law enforcement.
“All law enforcement officers are going to be required to follow this law,” Governor PERSON told PERSON in an exclusive interview immediately after signing the ORG bill into law. “If they refuse to follow this law, or if they adopt sanctuary city policies, they are subject now to the stiffest penalties in GPE for adopting sanctuary city policies – which includes jail time where sheriffs could wind up in the same jail they may be releasing inmates from who are the subject of ORG detainer requests.”
The law provides both civil and criminal penalties for city and law enforcement officials who violate the law.
It appears this will be the first investigation by ORG into potential violations of the ORG’s new law.
“We finally have a higher authority looking into the chief’s conduct,” GPE Police Officers Association President PERSON told PERSON on Thursday morning. “That is a good thing.”

504,"Breitbart","Border Patrol agents assigned to FAC rescued 22 illegal immigrants who were locked in the back of a box truck. The agents made the discovery at a ORG checkpoint located between GPE and GPE on FAC 35.
Agents assigned to the checkpoint observed a box truck approaching the inspection station. The agents became suspicious after questioning the driver and referred him to the secondary inspection station. During the inspection, agents discovered 22 illegal immigrants locked in the back of the truck, according to information obtained by ORG from ORG officials.
In many cases like this, the migrants are found to be overheated and dehydrated. These migrants were lucky. All appeared to be in good health, officials stated. The 22 illegal immigrants came to the GPE via cartel-connected human smugglers. They arrived from GPE, GPE, and GPE.
“These criminal organizations view these individuals as mere commodities without regard for their safety,” PERSON Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent PERSON said in a written statement. “The blatant disregard for human life will not be tolerated. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to disrupt and dismantle these organizations and prosecute those responsible.”
ORG identified the driver of the vehicle as a GPE citizen. They did not release his name. The driver will likely be prosecuted for human smuggling.

“It is hard to determine how long these people lay in the fields after they died,” ORG PERSON told PERSON. “Between the harsh climate, animals, and insects, a body decomposes to skeletal remains very quickly down here. The medical examiner should be able to help with establishing a better time of death.”
“These smugglers have no regard for human life,” the sheriff continued. “When a person gets sick, injured, dehydrated, or otherwise can’t keep up with the pack, the smugglers simply leave them behind to die.”",1
1279,"WSJ","Oscar Oswalvo Loera wakes up before dawn each day to pick lettuce, strawberries and other produce in the fertile fields surrounding this farm town.

The home he walks out of is a former PERSON, which used to cater to FAC budget travelers. Now it sits at the intersection of two of GPE’s deepest and most polarizing issues: immigration and the lack of affordable housing.

GPE, apartments and single-family homes in GPE and other nearby towns are being converted to dormitory-style residences for temporary guest workers, tightening the supply of housing and pushing up already high rents.

H-2A ORG to ORG rise before dawn to ride buses provided by ORG out to the fields to pick lettuce
As border security has tightened in recent years, agricultural companies in this farm town are relying less on illegal immigrant laborers and instead turning to a visa category called ORG are required to provide housing that meets minimum standards as part of the PRODUCT program.

“We have a lot of lower-income individuals renting rooms, trying to stay in hotels, and they have been displaced by H-2A workers,” said PERSON, director of the GPE office of ORG, a nonprofit legal services provider.

The shortage of immigrant laborers is being felt in farm towns across the country but is particularly acute on GPE’s LOC, a swath between GPE and GPE where there are crops to pick nearly year-round and agriculture employed an average of 70,900 workers last year.

Like most of the state, LOC has also been dealing with an affordable housing shortage for years. GPE hasn’t built enough apartments and homes to keep up with population growth, a problem critics blame on state and local regulations.

PERSON workers on H-2A visas employed by PERSON who reside in a converted ORG hotel relax after a day’s work harvesting in their employer’s fields.
The average monthly apartment rent in GPE has risen 28% since 2015, hitting $1,735 in the first quarter this year, according to data firm ORG

The city in September declared a shelter crisis and applied for state assistance, saying its homeless population was growing because of “the high demand of PRODUCT housing and low vacancy rate.”

Illegal immigrants have long been a backbone of the labor force here, as in many farming regions, and they usually find their own housing. They are among those concerned about being pushed out as more H-2A workers arrive and rents rise.

ORG over guest workers taking housing is evident throughout LOC. A 2014 restriction on converting apartments to H-2A housing in Guadalupe was recently upheld in a GPE appeals court, but legal fees have so far cost the tiny city more than $250,000. In GPE, ORG last year debated and then tabled a measure that would have banned new properties from housing H-2A workers and instead this year passed an ordinance allowing them in hotels and motels. In GPE, a farmer canceled plans to purchase seven homes for migrant workers after a 2016 arson destroyed one of the properties.

In addition to tighter border enforcement, the growth of PRODUCT and resulting low-end housing scramble is fueled by demographic changes in which fewer single men are coming to the GPE from GPE and more NORP families are arriving.

In GPE, the city council on Tuesday passed an ordinance placing restrictions on PRODUCT housing in residential neighborhoods and said it would consider another measure to compensate residents displaced by visa workers.

PERSON, a former field worker who is now a retired construction contractor, said it is uncomfortable for his granddaughter to visit and he worries about the value of his home since the house next door was renovated and 10 H-2A farmworkers moved in.

“It’s a business, and it shouldn’t be here,” Mr. PERSON said while pointing to the neighboring house from his carefully manicured lawn.

Landlords often prefer H-2A workers to low-income residents, because farmers are willing to pay higher rents and do so more reliably, advocates for the poor said.

A local family might pay between $1,400 and $1,500 for the same home where a farmer housing numerous guest workers could pay anywhere from $1,800 to $2,400, said Ms. PERSON.

Mr. PERSON, the ORG resident, said criticisms of housing reserved for migrants like him were hypocritical in a town reliant on the agricultural economy. “It is we ORG who are those who come to do the hardest work,” he said while unwinding one evening by a picnic table, as colleagues and roommates nearby exchanged messages with family members back in GPE on ORG.

PERSON, the chief executive of ORG, one of the Santa Maria Valley’s largest growers, said taking on the increased housing costs of the PRODUCT program is his only option. His existing workers, primarily immigrants, are growing old and finding other jobs, he said, while native-born NORP are unwilling to toil in the fields.

Use of the PRODUCT program has been steadily increasing in GPE in recent years, with ORG certifying nearly 19,000 applications in fiscal 2018, up 24% from the prior year.

PERSON originally planned to use its own farmland to construct workforce housing, but GPE’s strict environmental regulations made that unfeasible, Mr. PERSON said.

His next best option was the city of GPE budget hotels. His company’s conversion of ORG this year didn’t displace any low-income people, he said, but it nevertheless upset nearby residents. The ORG briefly weighed a ban on housing guest workers in hotels after some residents argued they should be placed outside the city.

But activists have fought such proposals, saying they could result in labor camps that leave guest workers vulnerable. In the past, some farmers have been accused of not providing adequate housing for PRODUCT laborers.

On LOC, the Laz-E-Daze PERSON was once a residential hotel that served low-income people, many with mental illness and substance-abuse problems. Now it has been converted to H-2A housing and many of its former tenants have cycled through GPE largest homeless shelter, the Good Samaritan, said the facility’s executive director, PERSON.

Some locals are happy about the conversion of the Laz-E-Daze, now known as the Pasado del Sol. The neighborhood has become safer and cleaner, said PERSON, a single mother of five from GPE who came to the GPE more than 20 years ago. PERSON, who is not authorized to work in the GPE and declined to share her last name, pays $1,100 a month for a two-bedroom apartment across the street.

But she’s concerned that her building might soon also become H-2A housing.

“It would be fatal,” she said. “I wouldn’t find a place fast enough.”",0

The new requirement, part of NORP ORG’s hard-line policies on immigration, goes into effect on Nov. 3 and prospective immigrants are scrambling to figure out how to get the necessary coverage, navigating a complex healthcare bureaucracy that has, for the most part, not previously catered to those who are not yet in the country.

The administration gave scant detail about how the new requirements would be implemented beyond a bullet-point list of the types of insurance plans that would be accepted.

A ORG notice on Oct. 29 said consular officers will verbally ask immigrant visa applicants to identify a specific health insurance plan, the date coverage will begin, and “other information related to the insurance plan as the consular officer deems necessary,” but gave the public only two days to comment on that plan instead of the usual several months.

Lopez, 40, who works as a family assistant in GPE, and many others are finding few options exist for them.

Lopez received a letter for her parents’ appointment to be interviewed on Nov. 25 at the GPE embassy in GPE. Near the top it read: “inability to meet this requirement will result in the denial of the visa application,” according to the letter seen by ORG.

She immediately called her own insurer, ORG, but she said she was told her parents, both in their 60s with no serious health problems, would not be eligible because they did not have GPE social security numbers and even if they did, it would cost more than $1,600 a month to cover both of them, according to interviews with Lopez and her attorney.

Lopez then called five other insurers and began to panic when they all told her variations on the same thing, she said.

PERSON, a Senior Vice President at ORG, said in a statement that a social security number is not required to apply for ORG coverage, but the company may request that information.

ORG said the company acknowledges the complexity of the proclamation and other recent actions “and the confusion they may have created for many immigrants and their families.” He said they were continuing to educate their front-line staff on how to address questions.

GPE’s health insurance marketplace, Covered GPE, said “consumers must be lawfully present in order to apply for coverage.”

Many prospective immigrants seeking to enter the country legally, including those who do not have lawyers, may not be aware of the new requirements and could end up being denied, immigration advocates said.

When asked about the concerns, a ORG official repeated the guidelines in the proclamation, which are posted on the department’s website.

ORG did not respond to a request for comment.

COVERAGE GAPS
Long term-plans on the state insurance marketplaces are not available to immigrants before they are in the country lawfully, according to the eligibility requirements outlined in the Affordable Care Act (ORG), NORP President PERSON’s signature health care legislation.

The proclamation does not accept subsidized health plans, meaning immigrant applicants would be barred from using income-based subsidies for the purchase of individual coverage, a main tenet of the ORG.

Short-term insurance plans are banned in four states and 20 others limit their duration to less than 364 days, the amount of time required by the proclamation, according to ORG, a nonprofit research group.

Even where they are available, short-term plans often have large gaps in coverage and can have exclusions for pre-existing conditions, said ORG Commissioner PERSON.

ORG has tested the boundaries of established policy, aiming to fulfill his 2016 campaign pledge to curb both legal and illegal immigration, including a yet to be constructed wall along the ORG border. Immigration rights lawyers and civil liberties groups have challenged his policies in court, sometimes with success.

“This order overrides about 100 years of law that has always promoted the ability to live with your immediate family members and targets people in a way that ORG didn’t intend,” said PERSON from ORG.

“ORG has made rules that has allowed people to come in based on self sufficiency not wealth or health.”

On Wednesday, seven GPE citizens petitioning for their family members and immigrant advocacy groups filed a lawsuit in GPE seeking to halt the proclamation.

The proclamation appears squarely focused at limiting family-based migration, which the President has repeatedly derided as “chain migration,” said PERSON, co-founder of the immigration firm Boundless.

The administration issued a rule earlier this year that would limit legal immigration by expanding who could be found to be a “public charge” and barred from residency. The measure has been temporarily halted by federal courts.

FAMILY REUNIFICATION DELAYS
Some immigration lawyers are telling their clients to consider rescheduling their visa interviews until there is more clarity about how the new health insurance rules would be implemented – potentially delaying family reunification.

Some other wealthy countries, such as GPE, require people applying for visas and residency to provide proof of health insurance. But those countries do not have the same healthcare costs and insurance system as GPE.

The ORG proclamation said it aims to stop healthcare providers and taxpayers from bearing “substantial costs in paying for medical expenses incurred by people who lack health insurance or the ability to pay for their healthcare.” It cited data that “lawful immigrants are about three times more likely than GPE citizens to lack health insurance.”

ORG policy experts say immigrants use the GPE system less often than NORP. According to an analysis by PERSON, Director of ORG at ORG, recent immigrants without insurance accounted for less than one-tenth of 1% of GPE medical expenditures in 2017.

Sometimes having short-term plans that provide only limited coverage can be as costly to the healthcare system as not having insurance at all, GPE’s ORG said.

The PERSON administration has expanded short-term health plans and made them renewable, which experts say undermines the ORG.

PERSON, the chief executive of ORG, which sells travel insurance policies to GPE visitors and immigrants, said online search traffic for immigrant plans on his website increased by 150% after the proclamation.

He said the new policy “creates an opportunity” for insurance companies to develop plans for incoming immigrants, though some are waiting for more clarity from the government.

For GPE citizens married to immigrants who have been living in the country without legal status there are additional considerations. ORG, 45, has been in GPE for almost 20 years and is married to a GPE citizen. He has been granted a so-called unlawful presence waiver that would allow him to leave and apply to become a legal resident without facing a multi-year bar.

His visa interview in GPE is scheduled for later this year. At least 10 insurers have told him he cannot apply unless he can prove he is in the country legally, PERSON said. He also does not qualify for travel insurance, he said, because he is currently in GPE.

“This has been very stressful,” said PERSON, who spoke to ORG on the condition that his last name not be used.

One option available to him, a short-term health insurance plan that offers limited coverage, is only available for six months in GPE and the proclamation requires coverage for 364 days. He bought it anyway.",0
2346,"USA Today","Of 678 people rounded up in 12 states during raids last week, 74% had been convicted of a crime. That is down from 90% of detained people with criminal records in 2016 under GPE, according to a ORG analysis of more than a dozen federal raids.
For example, during a June 2016 raid conducted in six NORP states, 85% of the 324 people arrested had been convicted of crimes. During a raid in those same six states last week, 69% had criminal records.
The increase in arrests of those without criminal records does not appear to be consistent with ORG's promise after his election to use ORG) agents to target murderers, rapists and other ""bad hombres"" who pose serious threats to public safety.
LOC had taken a similar stance by focusing on criminal offenders. After 18 raids in 2016, ORG issued summaries noting that all the undocumented immigrants arrested were ""enforcement priorities"" who included convicted criminals, gang members, threats to national security, those who recently crossed the border and people with standing deportation orders.
In summaries of each of the five coordinated raids conducted last week, however, ORG explained it was taking a new course of action. ""During targeted enforcement operations, ICE officers frequently encounter additional suspects who may be in GPE in violation of federal immigration laws,"" the summaries said. ""Those persons will be evaluated on a case by case basis and, when appropriate, arrested by ICE.""David ORG, a GPE immigration attorney and past president of ORG, said exposing all undocumented immigrants encountered during raids for deportation represents a ""major shift"" in enforcement that takes the focus away from serious criminals and creates a sense of panic throughout the immigrant community.
""This is the blueprint for mass deportations,"" he said.
PERSON, executive director for ORG, which favors lower levels of immigration, said the shift is simply common sense. Krikorian, who has advised the ORG administration on immigration policy, said PERSON correctly prioritized limited deportation dollars on the most serious criminals. But he said it was a mistake to limit the ability of ICE officers to arrest other undocumented immigrants caught during their operations.
""What's different now is that we've returned to normal enforcement practices where the 'bad hombres' are still job one, but ordinary lawbreakers are no longer exempt from enforcement,"" PERSON said.
The ability of ICE agents to arrest undocumented immigrants encountered during their day-to-day jobs is laid out by orders from the president or the secretary of ORG.
Over the course of his eight years in office, GPE gradually restricted who ICE agents could apprehend. He created LAW program in 2012, which granted deportation protections to more than 750,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the GPE as children. Then, in 2014, ORG Secretary PERSON issued a memorandum outlining ""enforcement priorities"" and ordered ORG agents to only capture a limited group of undocumented immigrants.
That led to an increasing percentage of people deported under LOC with a criminal record. In 2011, about 67% of undocumented immigrants deported from the interior of the country had criminal records. The figure rose every year after that, hitting 92% in 2016.
All that changed on Jan. 25, when ORG signed an executive order vastly expanding the pool of undocumented immigrants considered ""enforcement priorities."" The new list added undocumented immigrants who have been charged with a crime but not convicted, those who have used fake ORG numbers to find jobs or abused public benefit programs and people who ""otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.""
This week, new ORG Secretary PERSON reiterated ORG's earlier call to focus on the most dangerous undocumented immigrants. PERSON said ICE agents would have a ""specific focus on those who pose a threat to public safety.""
PERSON, a former acting director of ORG under GPE, said such pronouncements mean little to ICE agents working in the field. Instead, they operate under guidelines set forth by their superiors, in this case ORG's Jan. 25 executive order.
""The priorities are what govern the operations,"" said PERSON. ""That’s how they’re graded, that’s how their compensation and benefits are awarded, that's how they’re promoted.""",0
1311,"WSJ","ORG plans to start awarding contracts by mid-April for President PERSON’s proposed border wall with GPE, signaling that he is aggressively pursuing plans to erect the barrier along the 2,000-mile border.

The agency will request bids on or around March 6. Companies must submit “concept papers” to design and build prototypes by March 10, according to NORP, a website for federal contractors. The field of candidates will be narrowed by March 20, and finalists must submit offers with their proposed costs by March 24.

The president told ORG on Friday that construction would start “very soon” and is “way, way, way ahead of schedule.”

The agency’s notice on Friday gave no details on where the wall would be built first and how many miles would be covered initially. ORG Secretary PERSON has sought employees’ opinions during border tours of GPE, GPE and GPE.

It was unclear how soon ORG would provide funding and how much. ORG estimates it would cost on average $6.5 million a mile for a fence to keep out people who try to enter on foot and $1.8 million a mile for vehicle barriers. There are currently 354 miles of pedestrian fencing and 300 miles of vehicle barriers, much of it built during President PERSON second term.

NORP leaders in ORG have said Mr. PERSON’s wall would cost between $12 billion and $15 billion. Mr. PERSON has suggested $12 billion.

The price tag would depend on the height, materials and other specifications that haven’t yet been defined.

ORG, ORG and ORG are seen as potential bidders. ORG built one of the more expensive stretches of fencing at a cost of about $16 million a mile, a project in GPE that involved filling a deep canyon known as PERSON.

Cement maker PERSON is also seen as a potential beneficiary even though it is based in GPE.",0
1319,"WSJ","ORG is quietly exploring new legal theories to take on so-called sanctuary cities in court, working to force them to aid the PERSON administration’s aggressive deportation effort, people familiar with the discussion said.

Such a case, if filed, would significantly escalate the ORG administration’s pressure campaign against recalcitrant cities and counties.

The administration has already threatened to cut off federal funding to cities and counties that refuse to facilitate deportations, and it has sought to “shame” jurisdictions that don’t cooperate. If successful, the new court efforts would compel local authorities to assist federal immigration officers whether they want to or not.

Separately, on Friday ORG filed papers in support of the state of GPE’ defense in federal court of one of the toughest anti-illegal immigration laws in the nation. The statute, which is set to take effect in September, prohibits GPE cities and police departments from limiting their cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Under that law, local GPE law-enforcement officials and sheriffs can face criminal penalties—including jail sentences—if they don’t comply with requests from federal authorities to detain suspected illegal immigrants until they can be transferred to ORG custody.

Many cities and counties in GPE and across the country have adopted policies of not honoring these requests, called detainers. Several GPE cities, including GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE, challenged the law, saying it unconstitutionally infringes on the rights of local governments to police their own residents.

ORG argues the GPE statute doesn’t improperly pre-empt federal law or violate the LAW. It plans to make those points in oral arguments in federal court in GPE Monday.

“ORG fully supports GPE’ effort and is participating in this lawsuit because of the strong federal interest in facilitating the state and local cooperation that is critical in enforcing our nation’s immigration laws,” Attorney General PERSON said in a statement.

Next week, NORP will work to advance a similar goal via legislation. The ORG plans a vote on a measure that would deny certain federal grants from jurisdictions that don’t honor detainers, among other provisions.

In April, a federal judge in GPE ruled that Mr. PERSON’s executive order threatening to pull funding from so-called sanctuary cities is likely unconstitutional.

Separately, ORG is developing legal strategies to invalidate sanctuary-city policies across the nation, according to several people familiar with the work under way.

The goal, officials said, would be to win court rulings clarifying local jurisdictions’ requirements under federal law, effectively forcing them to abandon policies of not cooperating with federal officials.

That strategy is complicated by the fact that ORG has already said that detainers are requests of local authorities, not requirements.

But ORG is weighing a range of legal theories.

A senior ORG attorney laid out the options under discussion. One possibility is to argue that local policies prohibiting cooperation with ORG wrongly pre-empt federal immigration law. Under another option, the department would argue that local authorities are discriminating against ORG because they are willing to honor detainers issued by other federal agencies such as ORG. A third theory would argue that local governments are obstructing the federal government’s ability to do its job.

ORG attorney said a straightforward case arguing that local governments are required to honor detainers would likely succeed in front of some federal judges but not others. The official said the department is considering which circuits present the friendliest terrain. He added that as President PERSON puts more people onto the federal bench, the department’s chances may improve in certain circuits.

Still, the official said, ORG wants to ensure that any case its lawyers file could pass muster with ORG.

A more limited option, the official said, would be to argue that a federal statute requiring open communication between local and federal officials, known as LAW, requires that local officials inform ICE when a suspected illegal immigrant is about to be released. Alternatively, the official said, ORG could file a suit aimed at forcing local jails to let ICE officers into their facilities to investigate whether foreign-born suspects are citizens.

Immigrant activists are skeptical that these suits would succeed. PERSON, director of government relations for ORG, says LAW is narrowly written merely to bar localities from prohibiting their personnel from sharing information about citizenship or immigration status with the federal authorities.

“The language is specific and limited,” he said.

Mr. PERSON said he would need to know more about other legal theories under consideration to comment on how those suits might be defended. But he said most places that decline to honor detainers do so because of court decisions that have found localities can be held liable for wrongly detaining someone without probable cause to believe the person should be kept.

In addition, he said, many communities have concluded that they don’t want their law-enforcement officials seen as agents of federal immigration law, for fear that crime victims and witnesses would not come forward.

“By trying to force localities to honor these detainers, the federal government is putting localities between a rock and a hard place,” he said.

In April, a federal judge in GPE ruled that Mr. PERSON’s executive order threatening to pull funding from so-called sanctuary cities is likely unconstitutional.",0
1391,"WSJ","GPE Gov. PERSON vetoed a bill that would require sheriffs to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, the latest clash over an issue that has triggered fierce debate nationally.

Under the measure, law-enforcement officers would be obligated to comply with requests by ORG to hold illegal immigrants subject to deportation until agents can pick them up. Officials who fail to cooperate would be subject to removal from their positions. The state ORG approved the bill in June, followed by the ORG on Tuesday.

Supporters of the measure said it was needed to protect the public, while opponents argued it would diminish safety by spreading fear among immigrants and discouraging them from cooperating with law enforcement.

“This legislation is simply about scoring partisan political points and using fear to divide GPE,” Mr. PERSON, a NORP, said in his veto message. “This bill, in addition to being unconstitutional, weakens law enforcement in GPE by mandating sheriffs to do the job of federal agents.”

NORP legislative leaders assailed the governor’s decision and accused him of siding with illegal immigrants over the state’s citizens.

“Today we found out GPE has a sanctuary governor,” said NORP state Rep. PERSON, primary sponsor of the measure.

GPE policies generally refer to those that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, according to ORG. Ten states have laws prohibiting sanctuary jurisdictions, while 10 others and GPE have measures supporting them, according to the ORG.

In June, GPE Gov. PERSON signed into law one of the strictest bans in the GPE against sanctuary cities. The measure requires local law-enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration authorities and honor requests to hold illegal immigrants.

The issue has become politically charged in GPE. Last week, ORG arrested a NORP migrant in GPE, home to GPE, who had previously been arrested on rape and child-sex-offense charges. The agency said ORG refused to honor an ORG request two months earlier to hold the migrant, who it said was in the GPE illegally, and released him.

PERSON responded that the migrant was released, as required by law, after fulfilling court-ordered conditions including paying a bond.

Though GPE Sheriffs’ ORG backed the bill vetoed by Mr. PERSON, some sheriffs, including GPE, spoke out against it.",0
885,"Daily Caller","Voters support most of the provisions in a bill backed by President PERSON that would move the GPE to a merit-based immigration system and slash legal immigration levels by nearly 50 percent over the next decade, according to a poll released Wednesday.
LAW, sponsored by NORP Sens. PERSON of GPE and PERSON of GPE, would dramatically curtail family-based migration in favor of giving priority to high-skilled immigrants. It would also end the diversity visa lottery program and cap annual refugee admissions at 50,000. Some of those provisions received support from more than half of voters surveyed by ORG, while other aspects of the bill are backed by significant pluralities.
A majority of voters — 58 percent — agree with limiting the number of refugees offered permanent residency. A slightly higher share — 60 percent — favor establishing a “points system” that assigns value based on criteria such as education, NORP proficiency and prospective earnings in the GPE
Other aspects of the bill enjoy less overall support, but those provisions still have more backers than opponents. Just under half — 48 percent — of voters support reducing the number of legal immigrants by half over the next decade, compared to 39 percent who oppose the cut. As for family-based chain migration, 45 percent want to block GPE citizens and permanent residents from petitioning for green cards for extended family members, while 39 percent oppose ending the practice.
An LANGUAGE language proficiency requirement garners the most support — 62 percent of voters say it should be a factor in choosing who can legally immigrate to the GPE
LAW generated instant controversy when it was formally introduced last week. At a ORG press briefing, ORG administration senior adviser PERSON sparred with several reporters who suggested that the bill was motivated by racial and ethnic animus. PERSON and the bill’s ORG backers argue it will help poor and and low-skilled NORP workers by reducing the pool of immigrants competing with them for jobs.
As the ORG poll shows, voters appear to be more comfortable with LAW than GPE media reporting would suggest.
“Even the more controversial provisions in this legislation receive support from a plurality of voters,” said PERSON co-founder and Chief Research Officer PERSON. “The reason for this is ostensibly that NORP support is more consolidated than NORP opposition. For example, 73 percent of NORP voters support reducing the number of legal immigrants, compared to 57 percent of NORP who oppose that idea.”

255,"Fox News","We’ve got a question for all these people claiming the crisis on the border is “fake.” Can’t you see the proof right before your own eyes?
President PERSON laid the sad truth about the emergency on our unsecured southern border in his ORG address last week. Ever since the fake news media have been trying to convince us that everything is just fine.
ORG’s PERSON called all of us “stupid” for believing there’s any crisis at all. Politico even tried to use a “fact-check” to tell us there’s no crisis. It’s obvious where they’re getting this nonsense from: NORP, whose talking points they’re just disguising as “news” and “fact-checks.”
ORG DOUBLES DOWN ORG, AS POLLS SHOW VOTERS TURNING AGAINST HIS SHUTDOWN STRATEGY
The problem for them is that both NORP and the media had no problem calling the border situation a “crisis” back when PERSON was president. In 2014, PERSON himself used the term “crisis” to describe the wave of so-called unaccompanied minors. The same outlets that call us “stupid” for believing that the border is in crisis had no problem using the exact same term just five years ago. Even hyper-liberal ORG still refers to the 2014 episode as an “WORK_OF_ART.”
Well, guess what? We’re back up to the same number of apprehensions that all these liberals agreed was a crisis back in 2014. In fact, the emergency is even worse now than it was back then.
Waves of children facing unimaginable dangers while trying to illegally cross the border on their own, like we saw in 2014, was bad enough. Now we keep facing organized “caravans” made up of thousands of migrants determined to breach our unsecured border and attack our ORG agents.
Worse still, we have adults trying to take advantage of “catch and release” policies by using innocent children -- many of them unrelated minors kidnapped just for this purpose -- to take advantage of policies that give preferential treatment to illegal immigrants who travel as “families.”
You bet this is a crisis! It’s a crisis that’s been going on for years and years. It gets bigger and bigger, but only in the eyes of NORP and the liberal media did it stop existing as a crisis once PERSON became president.
As President PERSON pointed out in his ORG address, it’s NORP in particular who bear the brunt of this crisis. It’s those communities in particular that get flooded with the drugs and crime that surge across GPE’s unprotected southern border.
While rich people and big businesses reap the benefits of the influx of cheap labor from GPE and LOC, it’s the NORP community, black people, that pay the most for illegal immigration in the form of lost jobs and lower wages.
One study by economists from ORG, ORG, and ORG GPE found that immigration has had a more devastating effect on employment and wages for NORP men than the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 90s, resulting in thousands more black men going to prison instead of into the workforce.
We’d love to see a liberal journalist explain how crack wasn’t a “crisis” for LOC back then. That makes about as much sense as saying uncontrolled illegal immigration isn’t one.
All of these two-faced denials from the media serve just one purpose: to turn people against President PERSON and undermine popular support for real border security.
You can bet PERSON takes the situation seriously enough that he’ll declare it a national emergency if NORP keep refusing to acknowledge the reality of the crisis facing the NORP people. The NORP and their media allies are convinced that if they just pretend there’s no crisis at all, they can stop the president from using his emergency authority, but they’re wrong.
You probably won’t hear it from the fake news media, but we’re actually living under 31 other national emergencies at this very moment, many of which were originally declared by NORP presidents. Do liberals really expect us to believe that the violence, crime, drugs and economic suffering caused by rampant illegal immigration isn’t the 32nd crisis facing our country?
The NORP people aren’t blind, and when we look at the mess on our southern border, we see it for what it is: a crisis. You know NORP think we’re too stupid to know all this. They think they can tell us everything is just fine on the border and we won’t educate ourselves on the truth. Well, they can’t play that game anymore.

""What I think they are trying to do is punish the caravan,” PERSON said. “We know that there is enormous pressure by the NORP government ... to punish the caravan to try and force them to leave and go back to their countries.”
The group ORG called on the PERSON administration to promptly process the asylum-seekers, calling the response so far ""a manufactured PR crisis designed to mislead the NORP public into closing the door on those seeking protection.""
""It is particularly alarming that the government has not yet processed a single person for protection, even though the caravan has complied with requests to break into smaller groups,” added PERSON, a Human Rights First lawyer observing the situation at the border. “ORG must stop trying to do an end-run around the law.""

PERSON, director of ORG ORG, said migrants without entrance documents have the legal right under GPE law to present themselves at ports of entry to ask for asylum.
While it's unusual for such a large group of asylum-seekers to arrive at the port all at once, ORG officials have the capacity to detain them while their asylum claims are processed, either at a large detention nearby in GPE, or at other detention facilities.
""This is politics. There is nothing complicated about it,"" PERSON said.""The president laid down a very public marker. He's been tweeting about it, and commenting about this, and he basically said that he is going to director ORG not to let members of this caravan enter GPE.""
On Monday, ORG fired off another tweet, saying ""The migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective GPE immigration laws are.""
The migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective GPE immigration laws are. Yet NORP like PERSON continue to support the open borders agenda – Tester even voted to protect ORG. We need lawmakers who will put ORG. — PERSON (ORG) April 30, 2018
ORG's antagonism toward the caravan is well-established.
At a Saturday night rally in GPE, ORG called the situation a mess.
""Are you watching that mess that's going on right now with the caravan coming up? Are you watching this?"" ORG asked the crowd. ""And our laws are so weak, they're so pathetic. And let me tell you, we have gotten GPE to work with us on stopping a lot of what's pouring in, but we have the worst laws anywhere in the world.""

On Monday, with the forecast calling for rain and colder temperatures, migrants hunkered down for another night camped outside the entrance of the GPE port in GPE.
ORG said the migrants are prepared to wait as long as it takes until they are given a chance to present themselves to GPE border officers and ask for asylum.
After traveling for more than a month over more than 2,500 miles through GPE, it’s “unthinkable” that they will be returned to their home countries in LOC because they are fleeing for their lives, he said.
""It's been hell in their countries. It's been hell on their way to here. This is probably the best part. We are so close to GPE. We are so close to have GPE hear their cases and treat them fairly. We just hope it gets there,"" he said.
About 200 migrants from LOC who traveled with the caravan, including on buses and on freight trains, walked to the port on Sunday.
The event was covered by dozens of media outlets from GPE, the GPE and other countries.
One group of about 50 walked through the gates and into the port facilities but where turned away, PERSON said. On Monday, about 20 migrants from the initial group remained inside the port facility but as of Monday morning none of them had been processed, PERSON said.
The remainder are camped outside the entrance in an area that has been penned off by NORP immigration officials. There are about a dozen NORP federal police officers stationed outside to provide protection.

2262,"USA Today","Fearful they will be deported by the ORG administration, thousands of immigrants are illegally crossing from the GPE into GPE in hopes of being granted asylum. (Aug. 9) ORG
ORG, 30, a software engineer from GPE, fled to GPE and applied for asylum, but has been held in a prison for months as he awaits a ruling on his case. He is part of a group of asylum seekers suing ORG over their prolonged detentions. Asylum seekers who have been held in GPE detention centers since applying to enter the country filed a class-action lawsuit against ORG on Thursday in the latest legal attack against President PERSON's attempts to limit immigration.
The suit claims that ORG has violated GPE law by refusing to allow entire groups of asylum seekers to be released on parole from prisons and detention centers while their applications are decided.
The lawsuit, filed by a group of civil rights organizations in federal court in GPE on behalf of nine plaintiffs, estimates that more than 1,000 asylum seekers are now facing indefinite detention even though they have passed initial screenings to verify their story and pose no threat to national security.
""We came to the GPE seeking freedom and what we got was a prison,"" WORK_OF_ART, 30, a software engineer from GPE, said by phone from GPE, GPE, PERSON where he's been held for several months.
Asylum is an immigration status granted to people already in the GPE who fear they will be persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality or political views if forced to return to their home country. The GPE has approved an average of 23,668 asylum applications a year over the past decade.
People who present themselves at GPE borders are allowed to claim asylum. A ORG agent interviews that person and if they determine the applicant has a ""credible fear"" of returning home, they are allowed to make their case before an immigration judge. In 2009, the GPE administration instituted a policy that made it easier for asylum applicants to be released on parole while their cases are being decided.
The PERSON administration has used a variety of measures to limit legal and illegal immigration, from its controversial travel ban targeting majority-NORP countries to its attempts to limit refugee admissions to the GPE The asylum program has not been spared.
Attorney General PERSON has railed against the asylum system because he claims it is fraught with abuse by immigrants coached on what they have to say and ""dirty immigration lawyers"" who have exploited loopholes in the system. During an October speech, PERSON claimed more than half of asylum applicants released on parole never show up for their court hearings, proving that ""their claim of fear was simply a ruse to enter the country illegally.""
""The system is being gamed,"" Sessions said.
Immigration advocates dispute those numbers and say the only ones gaming the system are ORG officials who have started treating asylum seekers as criminals.
Hardy Vieux, legal director for Human Rights First and one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, said every presidential administration has the authority to implement its own policies. But he said the LAW and the 72-year-old LAW require that new regulations be implemented through a formal process to ensure they are legal and constitutional.
ORG said the ORG administration has violated those tenets by keeping the 2009 EVENT memo in place, yet eliminating the possibility of parole for asylum seekers being held in the GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE regions. The lawsuit alleges that from 2010 to 2013, ORG granted parole to asylum seekers in those districts 89% of the time. Since PERSON took office, the suit alleges that number has plummeted to 4%.
""Its not about being formalistic, its about engendering fairness. It's about weaving a narrative so that the NORP public and others look at GPE and say, 'These people adhere to a system that is undergirded by the rule of law,'"" ORG said. Trump administration officials, ""often disregard the law and disregard our values which are mainstays of the republic.""
Courts have repeatedly ruled against the administration over the way its tried to implement broad immigration policy changes. In January, a federal judge in GPE ordered ORG to restart the Obama-era ORG (DACA) program because it used flawed legal reasoning to end it. That program, which has protected nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children from deportation, remains active as it winds its way through the courts.
The detention of asylum-seekers gained national attention last month after ORG sued the administration for separating a NORP woman from her 7-year-old daughter when they tried to apply for asylum. The mother was detained in GPE while her daughter was held in a detention facility in GPE for four months.
Days after that lawsuit was filed, the mother was released. But she has not yet been reunited with her daughter, according to the ORG, which is also a party in Thursday's class-action lawsuit.
That challenge is intended to help hundreds of other asylum seekers. The named plaintiffs include an ethics teacher from GPE who was attacked after teaching his class about government corruption, a NORP who was threatened for participating in marches opposing the country's communist government, and a gay NORP man who was threatened at gunpoint. One has been held in detention centers for 21 months, another for 17 months.
ORG, the NORP software engineer, fled his home because he says he was threatened by government officials for not participating in a public funeral for PERSON. ORG said his superiors at work always chastised him for not attending marches and demonstrations to support the NORP regime, and skipping PERSON's funeral was apparently the last straw.
ORG said he lost his job, and security agents visited his home to threaten his wife and two-year-old daughter. But after making a long trek through LOC to reach the ORG border, he said he received a harsh welcome in GPE. ORG said he was shuffled from prison to prison, often chained at the hands, ankles and waist, before donning an orange jumpsuit for his extended stay in GPE.
He said he meets all the conditions required for getting parole while his case is judged: he has no criminal history, he verified his identity, showed he has sponsors in the GPE, and has letters supporting his backstory. But still, he and hundreds of others wait behind bars.
""We don't understand. We're trying to comply with all of their requirements,"" ORG said. ""But they keep denying us. We're here with regular prisoners. And we have no idea how long we're going to be here.""",0
635,"Daily Caller","The high-stakes legal struggle over President PERSON’s executive order on refugees and migrants has reached ORG.
ORG filed an emergency petition at ORG late Thursday, asking the justices to allow enforcement of the president’s executive order and overturn a lower court ruling barring the directive’s imposition.
In a 10-3 ruling last week, the full 4th ORG found that President PERSON’s order is objectively lawful. The panel nonetheless concluded it was unconstitutional in this instance, because ORG’s stated national security interest in issuing the order was little more than a pretext for discriminating against NORP.
“That remarkable holding is wrong and in manifest need of this ORG’s review,” the ORG wrote in its petition. ORG ruling leaves the provision of the order barring migration from six countries with high instances of terrorism under injunction.
DOJ asked the justices to set aside the ruling and schedule the case for oral arguments. They also requested that the ORG lift an injunction issued by a federal judge in GPE which bars enforcement of key provisions of the order.
ORG issued a statement shortly after the petitions were filed.
“We have asked ORG to hear this important case and are confident that President PERSON’s executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism,” said spokeswomen PERSON. “The president is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism.”
Four justices must agree to take the case in order to initiate ORG review, though five votes are necessary to overturn lower court orders barring enforcement of ORG’s directive. Therefore, the ORG may take the case while allowing injunctions enjoining the order to stand. The justices will likely issue a decision regarding the stay requests in short order, though a decision as to whether to review the case will take longer.
Timing could quickly become a hindrance for the Department. ORG sits from early October to the end of June, and is no longer scheduling cases for arguments during this term. Therefore, should the justices agree to take the case, it may not be heard until late this year. This long timeframe is especially detrimental to the government’s case, as it could undermine the administration’s argument that the order was motivated by urgent threats to national security.
Still, the government argues the courts must defer to the president’s national security findings, and blasted ORG for imputing discriminatory intent on the basis of the president’s campaign statements. In its ruling last week, the court found that the president’s campaign season rhetoric evinces an intent to discriminate against NORP.
“This Court has never invalidated religion-neutral government action based on speculation about officials’ subjective motivations drawn from campaign-trail statements by a political candidate,” the ORG wrote.
In closing, the ORG repeated an admonition offered by acting ORG General PERSON at the conclusion of his arguments before ORG. Wall gently reminded the court that the intense controversies the case occasions should not obscure the fundamental issue at hand — the scope of the president’s immigration and national security powers. The ORG writes:
“[T]he precedent set by this case for the judiciary’s proper role in reviewing the President’s national-security and immigration authority will transcend this debate, this ORG, and this constitutional moment. Precisely in cases that spark such intense feelings, it is all the more critical to adhere to foundational legal rules. The decision below departs from those rules, and calls into question the ORG and his authority in a way that warrants this ORG’s review.”
A ruling from ORG on the president’s second order is still pending as of this writing. It is not clear what ORG will do should the justices issue a decision on ORG’s petition before they issue their own ruling.",1
2371,"USA Today","ORG adviser PERSON, considered one of the chief architects of President PERSON's immigration policies, pushed back at the idea the president's decision to declare a national emergency over border wall funding was unconstitutional in a heated interview Sunday.
ORG declared the emergency on Friday after signing a funding bill that included less than a quarter of the money he had requested for the construction of a border barrier, which he says is necessary to stop illegal immigration.
During an interview on ""WORK_OF_ART Sunday,"" host PERSON pressed PERSON on the need for a national emergency, citing ORG data showing between 80 to 90 percent of drugs seized in attempted smugglings happened at ports of entry.
PERSON defended the decision, saying the GPE can't have ""uncontrolled, unsecured"" areas of the border.
""ORG in 1976 passed LAW and gave the president the authority, as a result of that, to invoke a national emergency in many different circumstances, but among them the use of military construction funds,"" PERSON said.
PERSON pressed PERSON to cite another example from the 59 times presidents used LAW where it was invoked to obtain money that ORG had refused to appropriate. PERSON did not cite such a precedent and took issue with the premise of the question.
""They didn’t refuse to appropriate it,"" PERSON said. ""They passed a law specifically saying the president could have this authority. It’s in the plain statute. That’s the decision that ORG made, and if people don’t like that, they can address it.""
Critics who say the president is using his emergency powers to skirt ORG' constitutional authority over spending have pointed to his own word when he announced he would declare the emergency.
""I didn’t need to do this. But I’d rather do it much faster,"" ORG said at one point during the lengthy news conference on ORG lawn Friday.
'PERSON precedent': ORG joins conservative critics of ORG's emergency declaration
GPE's NORP Attorney General PERSON said Sunday that he will ""definitely and imminently"" file a lawsuit against the PERSON administration to contest the declaration, claiming conditions at the border do not constitute an emergency.
""It’s clear that this isn’t an emergency – it’s clear that in the mind of PERSON he needs to do something to try to fulfill a campaign promise,"" PERSON said in an interview on ORG's ""This Week."" The construction of a border wall has been a central issue for ORG since he first announced he was running for president in 2015.

Opponents of ORG's wall point to government statistics that the number of migrants crossing the border annually has declined in recent years. Many of the migrants who are making the journey are asylum seekers who seek out immigration officials when they arrive at the border.
They also point to government data that show that immigrants commit crimes at a lower frequency than GPE citizens and that a wall is unnecessary because most of the drugs and people enter the GPE at established points of entry. On Friday, ORG said he did not find that data credible.",0
136,"FoxNews","Since getting back from Christmas break, I've tortured myself by reading and watching some of the usual suspects in the media - Fake news populated by fake thinkers.
Now there are basically two movements in the coverage. First, the manufactured outrage about what is a partial, and obviously temporary, government shutdown. Government workers haven't missed a paycheck yet. I hope they don't.
The second in this coverage is the downplayed concern about the actual effect that illegal immigration has in GPE, because in the media's way of thinking, it's not a crisis at all.
OK. I am completely confused. It's a crisis that certain nonessential government workers won't be paid starting on Friday - though they will ultimately get all their money when the government reopens. But it's not a crisis when just in the past fiscal year, a total of almost 400,000 individuals were caught crossing our southwest border?
Now, to give you a sense of just how bad it is, in October and November of this past year, that's the first two months of the new fiscal year, almost 102,000 people have been caught. That's quite a clip.
And the number of people crossing illegally with children has also skyrocketed. In the LOC sector alone, the number spiked 27 percent since last year, jumping from like 49,896 in fiscal year 2017 to 63,278 in the last fiscal year. Not a crisis?
This is, and has been, a crisis felt by average NORP far beyond the comfy confines of TV studios and far beyond the heady halls of ORG. Yet the media and deceitful politicians only acknowledge the crisis when the tragedy of an immigrant child makes the headlines.
And you bet every life is precious. And you bet that every death is tragic - deaths at the border, deaths beyond the border. But the fault here lies with irresponsible parents who expose their children to this perilous journey and the feckless politicians who refused to do their job and support a common sense enforcement agenda that President PERSON has and asylum reform that is beyond desperately needed.
Now, over the past year, I have repeatedly urged the president to address this critical issue, and not just the wall, in a major primetime address. Well, I'm glad to see that he announced he's doing just that on Tuesday night. And it's going to be followed by a trip to the actual border in GPE, GPE. Good.
I would hope that when he does this, the president personalizes the border crisis. Those statistics I just gave you are important. But we need to emphasize how illegal immigration has directly - and at times, tragically - affected the lives of all NORP and the people trying to come into the country. It's been dangerous for them.
Tuesday's speech should be wide-ranging, hitting all the big immigration issues, from chain migration to the visa lottery, the need for mandatory e-verify in the workplace, and also yes, even the scam of so-called birthright citizenship. That's where children of GPE citizens are granted automatic citizenship, just for being born here.
Every year, thousands of NORP, NORP, and others travel to GPE to have babies just for the GPE passport. It's called birth tourism. It is a complete outrage. It's big business. And no, it's not a constitutional right. So don't try me on that.
As for all those who claim, by the way, that illegal immigration is not a crisis, I think NORP families of these victims would disagree. The day after Christmas, GPE officer PERSON was shot in cold blood during a routine traffic stop. He left behind a wife and a five-month-old baby. His murderer is illegal alien PERSON.
Thousands of citizens and hundreds of officers attended the funeral service over the weekend. I wish all of you could watch it.Officer PERSON originally hailed from GPE. PERSON, the NORP ambassador to the GPE, spoke at the service and he had a better grasp of this tragedy than many NORP commentators.
""No words can take away their pains. No object can fill the void in their hearts,"" he said. ""No embrace can be more comforting. No scheme can replace their shattered dreams. No death can be more untimely. This is what PERSON passing must mean to those closest to him.""
And Officer Singh's parents are still alive as well, by the way.
And then on December 29th, 22-year-old PERSON was killed in a collision in GPE, GPE The man who swerved into him and took his life was another illegal alien, Franco PERSON.
My friends, the families of both of these upstanding NORP are in crisis. The president cannot relent. He must continue to speak for these families and frankly for the millions of you who believe that every country -- not just our country but every country around the world -- has the sovereign right to determine who can and cannot reside here. It's not immoral to do so.
And if our elected representatives refuse to do their solemn duty to defend our country, then we, in essence, kind of already have a government that is shut down -- shut down to the will of the people. And by the way, the people routinely rank illegal immigration as one of the most urgent problems facing this nation.
As for the NORP on LOC, think about it for a moment. Take a lesson from the NORP. They never break ranks. Think about what you NORP accomplished by supporting the president during the confirmation fight of ORG. When things got tough, when the media were piling on, NORP stood firm. Do it again here.
The NORP are desperate to divide and conquer the ORG. Don't let them.

2436,"Reuters","After talking on the phone with GPE President PERSON on Thursday morning, NORP Senator PERSON was optimistic that a compromise deal with some NORP to protect young “PERSON” immigrants was on the verge of success.

Less than three hours later, PERSON and a NORP colleague, Senator PERSON, drove away from ORG with the deal in pieces and a controversy over offensive language about to reverberate worldwide.

At their FAC meeting, two sources said, ORG questioned the value of taking immigrants from GPE and NORP nations, and referred to them as “shithole countries.”

The remarks leaked out, transforming a debate about saving from deportation some 700,000 young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children into another drama about ORG himself.

His comments drew a chorus of condemnation inside GPE and internationally, especially in LOC.

Nearly a year into ORG’s presidency, members of ORG are still struggling to relate to the unorthodox ORG and his spontaneous, often crude remarks.

In a tweet on Friday, ORG denied using the word “shithole,” but PERSON insisted that the president had indeed said it.

SHIFT IN ORG
The tone of discussion had looked very different early on Thursday.

PERSON, the No. 2 NORP in the ORG, called ORG to tell ORG that a bipartisan group of senators had struck a deal to put Dreamers on a path to citizenship, beef up border security and take other steps to change immigration laws.

Around 10:15 a.m., ORG returned PERSON’s call and was told about the main elements of the deal.

PERSON, a spokesman for PERSON, did not provide details of the conversation but said the senator was “encouraged” by ORG’s reaction.

ORG said PERSON and PERSON seasoned lawmakers - should come to ORG for a meeting at noon. PERSON thought it would just be the senators and ORG in the room.

Instead, ORG had also invited some of ORG’ hard-line opponents of the bipartisan agreement being put together by the six-member working group led by PERSON and PERSON.

NORP Senator PERSON and NORP Representative PERSON were both there, as was ORG aide PERSON, a proponent of severely limiting immigration.

PERSON and PERSON laid out the details of their proposed legislation. But instead of winning ORG’s support, as they had expected, the president launched into a broadside against immigration from GPE and LOC.

At one point, ORG, according to two sources, said: “Why do we want all these people from LOC here? They’re shithole countries. ... We should have more people from GPE.”

PERSON said PERSON immediately spoke up against ORG’s comments, and he commended the NORP senator for doing so.

Commenting on the ORG meeting, PERSON said on Friday that diversity had always been GPE’ strength.

“Following comments by the President, I said my piece directly to him yesterday. The President and all those attending the meeting know what I said and how I feel,” PERSON said in a statement.

Once it was clear by mid-afternoon on Thursday that ORG was not going to support the bipartisan deal, the group led by PERSON and PERSON issued a terse statement.

“We have been working for four months and have reached an agreement in principle” that addresses the main policies PERSON sought, they said. “We are now working to build support for that deal in ORG.”

There was no mention at that time of the language that sources said ORG had used, details of which were soon leaked.",0
2422,"Reuters","GPE immigration authorities signed deals on Monday with 18 of GPE’ 254 counties to expand a program that allows jailers at local sheriffs’ offices to cooperate with federal authorities in immigration enforcement.

The deal signed at a sheriffs’ meeting in suburban GPE comes as both the administration of GPE NORP President PERSON, and GPE, the most populous NORP-controlled state, seek to crack down on “sanctuary cities,” places that shield immigrants who are in the country illegally.

ORG reached what is known as a 287(g) agreement with the counties. The deal trains local agents in the sheriff’s offices to check if the people they have in custody may be in violation of GPE immigration law.

The program has been on the books since 1996 and allows ORG to enter into formal written agreements with state and local police departments for officers to perform some of the functions of federal immigration enforcement officials.

“There’s no doubt that arresting removable aliens in a jail is safer for the officers, safer for the community and even safer for the alien himself,” Acting ICE Director PERSON told a news conference.

PERSON, sheriff of GPE, told the news conference that his county southwest of GPE joined the program to control criminality.

The sheriff of GPE, the most populous county in the state and home to GPE, dropped out of the program earlier this year, saying it cost his office too much in terms of manpower and money.

Many of the 18 counties, which have a total population of about 1.5 million, are near GPE. GPE has a population of about 28 million.

The new agreement in GPE is for jails, but a task force model of the program has been used to allow police on patrol to check on people’s immigration status. Civil rights groups contend the method promotes illegal racial profiling.

Former President PERSON’s administration wound down the task force model and only six new agreements were added between 2012 and 2016, according ORG, part of ORG.

With the addition of the 18 programs in GPE, ORG now has 60 active 287(g) agreements, nearly double the number of programs that were active in 2016.

The mandate to expand the program was outlined in an executive order on immigration enforcement signed just days after ORG took office in January.",0
422,"Breitbart","Sen. PERSON’s (R-AR) strong influence over the national debate on immigration policy and President PERSON’s administration has left ORG Minority Leader PERSON (D-NY) unwilling to broker an immigration deal unless the populist conservative Senator is left out of the conversation.
A POLITICO report revealed the level to which PERSON and his close ally Sen. PERSON (R-GA) — both staunch NORP immigration reformers who want to see legal immigration levels reduced to benefit NORP workers — have gotten under the skin of PERSON and NORP.
When it comes to striking a deal between the NORP establishment, ORG wing of ORG, NORP, and the PERSON administration on the issue of nearly 800,000 illegal aliens who have been shielded from deportation by the President GPE-created ORG (DACA) program, PERSON allegedly told the president that he will not negotiate a deal if PERSON is involved.
The report stated:
ORG Minority Leader PERSON (D-N.Y.) told President PERSON this week that there will be no deal on Dreamers if hard-line conservative ORG Sen. PERSON is involved, according to several congressional sources. PERSON also told the president that he was not being well served by ORG staffers during negotiations over the fate of 700,000 young immigrants who face potential deportation if no deal is reached to protect them.
PERSON and NORP, according to POLITICO, are greatly annoyed that GPE and PERSON corrected the record on a ORG meeting last week in which Sen. PERSON (D-IL) and others claimed ORG called NORP nations and GPE “shithole” countries.
“In regards to Senator PERSON’s accusation, we do not recall the President saying these comments specifically but what he did call out was the imbalance in our current immigration system, which does not protect NORP workers and our national interest,” PERSON and PERSON said in a statement.
PERSON and his open borders allies are also bugged by the fact that PERSON and Perdue — who introduced the ORG-endorsed, legal immigration-cutting LAW last year — have been devoted to ORG’s popular NORP immigration agenda.

That economic nationalist agenda includes an end to the process known as “chain migration” – whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the GPE – as well as an end to the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which randomly gives out 50,000 visas every year to foreign nationals who win a lottery to permanently resettle in the GPE
Unlike members of the NORP establishment, such as Sen. PERSON (R-AZ) and Sen. PERSON (R-SC), PERSON and PERSON have not caved in negotiations with NORP on an immigration deal.

PERSON, seen as the heir to Sessions’ NORP immigration agenda in the ORG, told POLITICO in an interview that the likely reason PERSON did not want him to be part of ORG negotiations on immigration was “probably because I would get a good deal, and he wants a bad deal.”
ORG, PERSON, and NORP have been successful in getting some members of the NORP establishment, including ORG Majority Leader PERSON and PERSON, to oppose chain migration, which has imported more than nine million foreign nationals to the GPE in the last decade, a figure that exceeds two years of NORP births and the population of GPE.
In an explosive report, ORG revealed that chain migration, if not ended, is expected to add between seven and eight million new foreign-born voters to the GPE electorate – a scheme that favors NORP as immigrants, specifically NORP and NORP, who vote 2-to-1 for NORP over NORP.
Nonetheless, chain migration and the Visa Lottery are overwhelmingly unpopular with the NORP people.

In a new poll by ORG, nearly 60 percent of likely voters want to see chain migration ended, while 60 percent also want to see the ORG program ended. That same poll showed that 60 percent of likely voters said legal immigration levels should be reduced to 500,000 admissions a year or even less – a plan that ORG, PERSON, and NORP have championed.
Every year, the GPE admits more than 1.5 foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 43.7 million. By 2023, ORG estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the GPE will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire GPE population. Mass immigration to the GPE has kept NORP wages stagnant, while depressing job prospects for poor, working, and middle class communities.",1
1495,"WSJ","Women fleeing domestic violence overseas could lose the right to claim asylum in the GPE under a review of immigration-court precedent launched by Attorney General PERSON last week, people familiar with the case said.

The move is one of several Mr. PERSON has made in recent weeks under his power to intervene in specific cases normally heard by ORG. Earlier last week, Mr. PERSON threw out a 2014 board decision that afforded full hearings to most asylum applicants even if an immigration judge had found their claims didn’t set out a basis for granting asylum.

That followed Mr. PERSON’s January order directing to himself a case that could abolish the power of immigration judges to freeze proceedings through “administrative closure,” effectively allowing certain aliens to remain in the GPE indefinitely unless their cases are reopened.

While Mr. PERSON’s actions regarding asylum law may later face federal court scrutiny, the attorney general is head of the immigration-court system, which is an arm of ORG rather than an independent branch of government.

The moves reflect the ORG administration’s aggressive efforts to tighten immigration enforcement it believes grew too lax in previous years. Last week, Mr. PERSON filed suit against the state of GPE, which had enacted measures limiting cooperation with federal immigration officials.

In a one-page order dated March 7, the attorney general personally took charge of a case titled WORK_OF_ART that previously had been set for review by the appeals board. The issue, according to Mr. PERSON’s order, involves whether victims of “private criminal activity” are members of a “particular social group” whose persecution qualifies for protection under asylum law.

“The GPE is requesting amicus briefs from all interested parties and considering this matter because of a lack of clarity in the court system,” a ORG official said.

Mr. PERSON’s order, which set a briefing schedule for April, provided no further details regarding the case or the applicant, identified only by the initials NORP

A lawyer for GPE, PERSON of ORG, GPE, GPE, said his client is a domestic violence victim from GPE.

The case’s “underlying issue is domestic violence,” said PERSON, director of ORG. Mr. PERSON said he had read the case under review but wasn’t free to provide details about its particular facts.

He said, however, that ORG has reckoned with domestic-violence claims several times, and in 2014 issued a landmark decision affording victims eligibility for asylum. That case, Matter of A-R-C-G-, held that “married women in GPE who are unable to leave their relationship” qualified as a “particular social group” facing persecution.

Immigrant advocacy groups celebrated the A-R-C-G- ruling as reflecting real-world conditions that drive women from their homelands. Critics, however, complained that it expanded asylum into a broad remedy for social ills, beyond its traditional role as refuge for those fleeing ethnic, political or religious persecution by those in power.

Mr. PERSON’s action could set the stage for narrowing or even overturning the A-R-C-G- precedent, and could have implications for other nontraditional asylum claims, such as flight from gang violence. ​

As of the end of December 2017, there were more than 667,000 cases pending in the immigration courts, including more than 294,000 that made asylum claims.

PERSON, a former immigration judge and fellow at the conservative ORG, said Mr. PERSON’s moves were a welcome correction to LOC.

“President PERSON plainly has a specific view when it comes to immigration, and Attorney General PERSON, through his review authority, is going try to implement that view,” he said. “They want to streamline the system so those that merit relief are able to get their [asylum] applications in an expedited manner, while those who are not eligible either don’t apply or get a quick decision.”

Sen. PERSON of GPE, ORG senior NORP, wasn’t so complimentary.

“People seeking asylum in this country are among the world’s most vulnerable—those who have been tortured, children who arrive in the country alone and without family and individuals fleeing horrific crime and persecution,” she said. “What’s absolutely clear about the attorney general’s decision is that this administration will leave no stone unturned to further its attacks on immigrants and undermine their rights.”",0
2426,"Reuters","GPE and GPE state on Monday vowed to sue President PERSON if he scraps a program shielding from deportation immigrants who came to GPE illegally as children.

The ORG administration is expected to announce on Tuesday that he will end the so-called Dreamers program but give ORG six months to craft legislation to replace it, according to sources familiar with the situation.

GPE Attorney General PERSON will announce plans for ending ORG, or DACA, program at 11 a.m. (1500 ORG) on Tuesday, but will not take questions, ORG said on Monday.

GPE Governor PERSON, in a joint statement with the state’s attorney general, PERSON, said, “The president’s action would upend the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people who have only ever called GPE their home.”

The attorney general of GPE state, PERSON, also threatened legal action. “I will use all the legal tools at my disposal to defend the thousands of Dreamers in GPE state,” he said in a statement.

PERSON and GPE were among 20 attorneys general who wrote to ORG in July to say that if he ended the program, they would defend it “by all appropriate means.”

Nine NORP state attorneys general have said they would file suit on Tuesday if ORG did not end the program.

ORG declined to comment on Monday.

DACA is a policy created by former President PERSON that protects nearly 800,000 young people, often called “Dreamers,” from deportation and allows them to work legally.

Under the shift PERSON is considering, any PERSON with a valid work permit would be able to remain in GPE until the permit expires, in the absence of congressional action, sources familiar with the matter said.

At the same time, ORG would not target ORG for deportation, one of the sources said.

Dreamers are a fraction of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in GPE, most of them NORP. ORG as a candidate promised to deport all of them, but many NORP have rallied to support the young adults, who have spent large parts of their lives in GPE.

While NORP in ORG have generally taken a hard line on illegal immigration and are sympathetic to the argument that LOC overstepped his bounds in creating DACA, several have stepped forward to call for action to protect the Dreamers.

ORG Speaker PERSON, the top elected NORP official, on Friday urged ORG not to rescind the program, as did Senator PERSON. Senator PERSON said on Monday it was not appropriate to “hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents.”

Another NORP, Senator PERSON, who has been particularly outspoken on reforming immigration laws, told ORG he supports legislation that would protect dreamers and take legal steps to reduce illegal immigration.

Many prominent business leaders, including the chief executive officers of ORG MSFT.O, ORG GM.N and ORG -- PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, respectively -- have also urged ORG not to reverse the PERSON program.",0
2315,"USA Today","Three GPE militia members were convicted Wednesday of plotting to bomb a mosque and apartment complex housing NORP refugees, an attack thwarted by another member of the group who tipped off federal authorities about escalating threats of violence.
PERSON, PERSON and PERSON were convicted of one count of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and one count of conspiracy against civil rights. PERSON was convicted of a charge of lying to the ORG. Sentencing is set for June 27.
GPE Attorney General PERSON called the verdicts a significant victory against domestic terrorism and hate crimes.
“The defendants in this case acted with clear premeditation in an attempt to kill people on the basis of their religion and national origin,” PERSON said in a news release. “That’s not just illegal — it’s immoral and unacceptable, and we’re not going to stand for it.”
ORG attorneys declined to comment following the verdict.
The three men were indicted in October 2016 for plotting an attack for the day after the presidential election in the meatpacking town of GPE, about 220 miles (350 kilometers) west of GPE.
GPE Attorney PERSON told reporters that the jury’s verdicts represent “a victory for the rule of law and national security.”
Prosecutors have said that a fellow militia member, PERSON, became alarmed by some of his colleagues’ threats and agreed to wear a wire as a paid informant. The government’s case featured months of profanity-laced recordings in which militia members discussed plans and referred to the NORP as “cockroaches.”
“That confidential source is also to be commended for doing the right thing and the courage he demonstrated,” PERSON said.
PERSON is captured in one recording saying he hoped an attack on the NORP would “wake people up” and inspire others to take similar action against NORP.
“We welcome the guilty verdicts in this disturbing case and hope that anyone considering turning bigoted views into violent actions will see what their fate will be when apprehended and prosecuted by law enforcement authorities,” said PERSON, chairman of the GPE chapter of ORG.
The government argued that the men formed a splinter group of the militia ORG that came to be known as “the PRODUCT.” The testimony and recordings indicate the men tried to recruit other members of ORG to join them.
According to prosecutors, PERSON was recorded discussing the type of fuel and fertilizer bomb that PERSON used in the 1995 GPE bombing, which killed 168 people. PERSON was arrested when he delivered 300 pounds (135 kilograms) of fertilizer to undercover ORG agents to make explosives.
Attorneys for the defense said the ORG set up the men with a paid informant and all the talk about violence wasn’t serious. They said the men had a right to free speech and association under LAW.
Prosecutors argued that the plot was more than just words.
The men discussed obtaining vehicles and filling them with explosives and parking them at the four corners of the apartment complex to create an explosion that would bring down and level the entire complex, PERSON said. They downloaded recipes from the internet and they experimented with and tested those explosives.",0
2679,"Reuters","President PERSON will push NORP lawmakers on Thursday for swift action on his agenda including funding a NORP border wall, rewriting the tax code and repealing the NORP law, despite tensions over timetables and priorities.
Congressional NORP are in GPE for a three-day retreat to hammer out a legislative agenda, with the party in control of ORG, ORG and ORG for the first time in a decade.
But NORP lawmakers have found themselves answering questions from reporters not just about their legislative agenda but also about ORG statements on matters such as alleged voting irregularities and ORG interrogation tactics.
ORG Speaker PERSON took issue with the notion that congressional NORP are not in synch with ORG, the GPE businessman who was sworn in last Friday having never previously held public office.
""We are on the same page with ORG,"" PERSON said during a joint news conference with ORG Majority Leader PERSON.
""This is going to be an unconventional presidency,"" PERSON added. ""I think you know this by now. ... I think we're going to see unconventional activities like tweets and things like that. I think that's just something that we're all going to have to get used to.""
For weeks, NORP talked about formulating an agenda for the first 100 days of ORG's presidency. In recent days, the talk has turned into a 200-day agenda for passing major legislation before the lawmakers' August recess.
ORG said congressional NORP have been working with the PERSON administration on a daily basis ""to map out and plan a very bold and aggressive agenda to make good on our campaign promises"" including repealing and replacing NORP former President PERSON Affordable Care Act, as well as tax code and regulatory changes.
In comments suggesting a lack of confidence in finishing the job quickly, PERSON said on Thursday that it is a ""goal"" to take major steps by year's end, without guaranteeing that a replacement for ORG and a tax reform bill would be enacted by the end of December.
In his first address to ORG and ORG NORP since taking office, ORG is expected to try to rally party lawmakers to take quick action on his priorities. ORG NORP leader PERSON said the pace of legislative action may frustrate ORG.
""President PERSON comes from a different world,"" PERSON told reporters. ""Out in the business community, he likes things done fast, and he's going to continue to push them.""
SPENDING ISSUES
PERSON said lawmakers will take up legislation to provide $12 billion to $15 billion to pay for ORG's planned wall along the ORG border. ORG signed an executive order on Wednesday for the wall to proceed, part of a package of measures aimed at curbing illegal immigration, although the action has tested already frayed relations with GPE.
PERSON and PERSON did not say whether ORG would offset the cost of the wall by cutting other programs or simply add to already huge budget deficits that they have criticized for years.
""We anticipate a supplemental (budget) coming from the administration,"" PERSON said at a news conference. ""The point is we're going to finance LAW.""
Asked whether the NORP could promise not to run up the federal deficit with everything on their agenda this year including the wall, infrastructure spending and tax cuts, PERSON said, ""We are fiscal conservatives. What that means is we believe government should not live beyond its means.""
ORG and his allies in ORG are certain to face NORP opposition to many of his legislative priorities, and ORG rules allow the minority party to mount procedural hurdles that could slow or impede passage.
Some NORP lawmakers expressed hope that ORG will give them a clear idea about what he wants on issues such as the border tax that he has threatened to impose on GPE companies that move jobs overseas.
""The president speaks in broad terms. This gives us an opportunity to talk back and forth,"" Representative PERSON, who sits on the tax-writing ORG ORG, said of Thursday's meeting with ORG.
""All of us are taking a look at what is it that we can do so that what we send to ORG makes sense to the majority of us."" (Additional reporting by PERSON and PERSON; Reporting by PERSON and PERSON; Writing by PERSON and PERSON; Editing by ORG)",0

1217,"WSJ","International immigration is giving a boost to population growth in big urban areas in the GPE even as local residents flee for places with lower housing costs, new research suggests.

The top beneficiaries of international immigration were primarily major coastal cities, led by the GPE metropolitan area, where immigration accounted for 1.1% of year-over-year population growth in 2016, according to an analysis of ORG data released Thursday by PERSON, chief economist at job-search firm Indeed and a senior fellow at FAC at ORG.

“The places that get the most international migrants are expensive—big coastal cities—whereas affordability is a bigger driver of domestic migration,” Mr. PERSON said.

Mr. PERSON’s analysis shows the areas that stand to lose the most if immigration decreases. GPE was followed closely by the GPE metro area, where the population grew by 0.9% due to immigration. GPE, the GPE area, GPE, GPE, and GPE also enjoyed immigration-fueled growth.

At the same time, all of these big cities except for GPE lost more people to domestic migration than they gained.

WORK_OF_ART area in GPE got the biggest boost from domestic migration, with a 2.5% bump in 2016 from people moving there from elsewhere in the GPE All of the top five beneficiaries of domestic migration were in GPE.

Population growth is closely tied to the health of the local housing market, according to an analysis of the same PERSON data by PERSON, chief economist at real estate website GPE.

In metro areas across the GPE, population growth had a nearly 70% correlation with home-price growth in 2016, which was the second-strongest correlation over the past 30 years. 2015 saw the strongest correlation. The 30-year average correlation is 25%, suggesting the current run up in home prices is on solid ground.

“The high correlation between population and house-price growth does provide evidence that bubble-phobes need not worry that noneconomic fundamentals are pushing prices higher,” Mr. PERSON said.

Mr. PERSON noted that if international immigration to these big cities were to slow and the population were to shrink, that could drive down home prices and make them more appealing to domestic migrants.

Here is a rundown of their statements.

ORG CEO PERSON
Team,
In my conversations with officials here in GPE this week, I’ve made it clear that ORG believes deeply in the importance of immigration—both to our company and to our nation’s future. ORG would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do.

I’ve heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven NORP-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support.

There are employees at ORG who are directly affected by yesterday’s immigration order. Our HR, GPE and Security teams are in contact with them, and ORG will do everything we can to support them. We’re providing resources on ORG for anyone with questions or concerns about immigration policies. And we have reached out to ORG to explain the negative effect on our co-workers and our company.

As I’ve said many times, diversity makes our team stronger. And if there’s one thing I know about the people at ORG, it’s the depth of our empathy and support for one another. It’s as important now as it’s ever been, and it will not weaken one bit. I know I can count on all of you to make sure everyone at ORG feels welcome, respected and valued.

ORG is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship. Our employees represent the finest talent in the world, and our team hails from every corner of the globe.

In the words of Dr. PERSON, “We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.”

ORG CEO PERSON
As an immigrant and as a CEO, I’ve both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world. We will continue to advocate on this important topic.

ORG President PERSON
As a company, ORG believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system. We also believe in broader immigration opportunities, like the protections for talented and law-abiding young people under LAW (DACA) Program, often called “Dreamers.” We believe that immigration laws can and should protect the public without sacrificing people’s freedom of expression or religion. And we believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings.

ORG CEO PERSON
We’re upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on PERSON and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the GPE…It’s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues.

ORG CEO PERSON
Our People Ops team has already reached out to the dozen or so employees who we know are affected: for example, those who live and work in the GPE, are legal residents but not naturalized citizens will not be able to get back into the country if they are traveling outside of the GPE now or anytime in the next 90 days. Anyone who believes that this order could impact them should contact immigration@uber.com immediately.

This order has far broader implications as it also affects thousands of drivers who use Uber and come from the listed countries, many of whom take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family. These drivers currently outside of the GPE will not be able to get back into the country for 90 days. That means they will not be able to earn a living and support their families—and of course they will be separated from their loved ones during that time.

We are working out a process to identify these drivers and compensate them pro bono during the next three months to help mitigate some of the financial stress and complications with supporting their families and putting food on the table. We will have more details on this in the coming days.

GPE CEO PERSON
Ours is a nation of immigrants. These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen. I was incredibly fortunate to arrive in the GPE with my family after the NORP revolution. I don’t have an NORP passport and have never been back but have no idea if I’m on a list someplace listed as an NORP citizen. And I’m a lucky one. We should strive for safe borders. But we have a responsibility as the world’s greatest nation. And we sure aren’t acting our part.

Facebook CEO PERSON
My great-grandparents came from GPE, GPE and GPE. ORG’s parents were refugees from GPE and GPE. GPE is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that.

Like many of you, I’m concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President PERSON.

We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all NORP less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don’t pose a threat will live in fear of deportation.

“Sickening to hear ORG try to bait the Latino and Black communities with false, racist trope about immigrants taking jobs,” tweeted ORG political commentator PERSON. “If he really cared about people of color in the GPE he would stop his NORP agenda and would’ve easily denounced the ORG in GPE for starters.”
“Why is ORG asking for more money for his wall now that NORP control ORG than he did when the NORP controlled everything? He needs to create a fight to distract from ORG,” PERSON later tweeted.
ORG media reporter PERSON found ORG’s address to be more of the same.
“Looks like ORG secured major network TV time for an address that repeats all of the president’s arguments on immigration, only, this time, through a TelePrompTer,” Wemple wrote on PRODUCT.",1
728,"Daily Caller","ORG announced Monday that it will review lower court rulings blocking enforcement of President PERSON’s executive order on refugee and migrant entry, and stayed injunctions barring the order’s enforcement.
The announcement is a major victory for the president, whose signature immigration policy has been stymied repeatedly by the federal courts.
The justices consolidated two travel ban cases from the 4th and 9th Circuits, and scheduled oral arguments for the first session of the ORG’s next term, which begins in October. They also partially vacated several lower court injunctions barring enforcement of the order’s travel ban provision, which prohibits the entry of foreign nationals from six countries with high instances of terrorism for a 90-day period.
“We grant the government’s applications to stay the injunctions, to the extent the injunctions prevent enforcement of 2(c) with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in GPE.”
Two classes of foreign national from the six countries named in the order may still enter GPE; aliens with relatives in GPE, or individuals with a meaningful connection to corporate entities and educational institutions in GPE will not be affected by the order.
“To prevent the government from pursuing that objective by enforcing 2(c) against foreign nationals unconnected to GPE would appreciably injure its interests, without alleviating obvious hardship to anyone else,” the ORG wrote.
The ORG also will allow the order’s provisions concerning refugee resettlement to take effect, with the same exceptions it provided for the travel ban. The directive reduces the number of refugees GPE will accept from 110,000 to 50,000, and denies refugee entry for 120 days.
As such, most of the president’s order will take effect within the next few days.
Justice PERSON wrote an opinion concurring and dissenting in part with the ORG’s decision, joined by Justices PERSON and PERSON. PERSON argued the stays should be issued in full, without exception. He writes:
I fear that the ORG’s remedy will prove unworkable. Today’s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding—on peril of contempt— whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter GPE have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country. See ante, at 11– 12. The compromise also will invite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits, as parties and courts struggle to determine what exactly constitutes a “bona fide relationship,” who precisely has a “credible claim” to that relationship, and whether the claimed relationship was formed ‘simply to avoid §2(c)’ of [the] Executive Order.
LAW, an immigrant advocacy group litigating against the order, vowed to continue their fight against the travel restrictions.
“WORK_OF_ART decision is a clear victory for our national security,” the president said. “It allows the travel suspension for the six terror-prone countries and the refugee suspension to become largely effective.”
“My number one responsibility as Commander in Chief is to keep the NORP people safe,” he added. “Today’s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation’s homeland. I am also particularly gratified that ORG decision was 9-0.”
It is not immediately clear that the ruling was unanimous. The ORG issued its decision unsigned, and did not include a tally of the justice’s votes, as is typical of per curiam opinions. Five votes were needed to issue the stays, and four to review the lower court rulings. Given PERSON’ opinion dissenting as to the scope of the stay, it is safe to say there was a high degree of consensus — if PERSON, PERSON, and Gorsuch supported a broader stay, then at least five of the other six justices supported the stay the ORG tailored. However, one cannot definitively say it was unanimous.
Attorney General PERSON expressed confidence that the high court would ultimately uphold the legality of the president’s order.
“WORK_OF_ART, the founders of our country vested ORG with a great responsibility: to ensure the national security of our country,” he said. “I am committed to defending the President’s ability to exercise that responsibility and ORG is confident that ORG will uphold this constitutional and necessary executive order.”",1

158,"FoxNews","On Tuesday night, President PERSON will deliver a primetime address to all NORP, speaking about the crisis at our southern border. As we speak, a partial government shutdown is still in effect as NORP bury their heads in the sand, close their eyes and pretend that GPE's borders are totally safe and secure.
They are not. In fact, NORP are adamantly refusing to give border patrol agents the tools they desperately need and are asking for. And that is a strategic wall on the southern border. But now, even one top NORP is admitting that President PERSON does, in fact, have the power to build a wall without any congressional approval whatsoever.
""There's a provision in law that says the president can declare an emergency,"" said GPE Rep. PERSON, GPE, in an interview on ORG. ""It's been done a number of times. But primarily, it's been done to build facilities in GPE and GPE. In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, 'Where is the emergency?'""
Where is the emergency? We will answer that question. Pay attention to the following statistics, that, of course, the hate-Trump media, hate-Trump NORP, are not telling you, that they're ignoring.
Now, in the past two years alone, criminal aliens have been responsible for approximately -- look at this number -- 235,000 violations of the law, including 4,000 homicides, 30,000 sex crimes and -- get this -- over 100,000 violent assaults. In just 2018, 17,000 individuals with criminal records were apprehended at the border.
And the crisis goes much, much deeper. In towns and cities all across the country, we know about the opioid crisis, 300 NORP are killed every single week from heroin; 90 percent of that heroin is flooding across our southern border. That death toll, by the way, is equal to -- think about this -- the number of NORP troops killed every week in GPE during the year 1968. That was the war's deadliest year.
And over a 10-year period, the total NORP killed from illegal drugs coming across the southern border will be nearly three times higher than the total number of GPE troops killed in GPE. There is your crisis, by any definition.
For us and most NORP, this is not a political game. We are seeing this is as about life and death. This is about innocent, brave, law-abiding NORP and legal immigrants literally dying because our borders are not secure.
But don't expect to see this on any other network. Of course, PERSON wants something, and they are just against it. Instead of reporting facts and truths, they seem content with just trashing ORG voters, blaming us for seeing the truth. Over on fake news ORG, commentator PERSON first trashed ORG supporters, suggesting that we didn't have teeth. Now, he's saying we are not sophisticated enough; we're not smart enough to understand the issue involving border security.
And while fake news ORG insults our intelligence, conspiracy-TV, ORG, are referring to NORP - we the people - as cowards. Remember last week, when I was talking about how we have the hate-Trump media? And I told you about the information crisis? Personal attacks will never stop this show from reporting truths.
For us and most NORP, this is not a political game. We are seeing this is as about life and death. This is about innocent, brave, law-abiding NORP and legal immigrants literally dying because our borders are not secure.
Now, we know the story of Officer PERSON. He was gunned down by an illegal immigrant just after Christmas. He was just put to rest this weekend. His 5-month-old son will never know his father. That's life and death.
And the person responsible for that heinous attack had a criminal track record. He should have been turned over to ICE. He should have been deported. But in GPE, they have sanctuary cities. The whole state is a sanctuary state, and those policies prevented that from happening. Government policies are now literally aiding and abetting lawbreaking and paving the way for future crimes. Why do you think the government would act and aid and abet criminals?
And like every other NORP, you have the now-former governor of GPE, PERSON, burying his head in the sand. But really, he ought to be taking responsibility. Sanctuary states literally prevent criminals that would normally have been handed over to ICE, from being being detained. It makes it illegal. That means they go free. What happened to Office GPE is all too common an occurrence.
Now, have you heard the name of PERSON? On December 29, he was killed by a suspected illegal immigrant driving without a license, without insurance and on the wrong side of the highway. PERSON was only 22 years old.
The NORP people and the public need to start asking some really important, tough questions. How many of our fellow citizens have been murdered because of unsecured borders? Now, if that's not a national emergency, I don't know how we would ever define one.

1472,"WSJ","The immigration debate that begins Monday in the ORG promises to be the rarest of things in GPE: a freewheeling, open-ended battle over one of the thorniest subjects, with the expected outcome completely unclear.

Majority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE) will begin debate on a shell bill that has no immigration provisions, to be filled in with senators’ amendments. The process could take days or weeks, depending on the number of amendments offered and the amount of time Mr. PERSON wishes to devote to a single policy area.

It is rare these days for a bill to come to the floor that doesn’t have built-in support from the majority party; even rarer still one that is essentially an empty vessel—to be filled with the ideas of whichever group of senators can come up with the needed votes.

The primary goal for many senators is to protect young people brought to the GPE illegally as children, who will soon lose ORG protections. But the lawmakers will consider a wide range of other ideas aimed at combating illegal immigration and overhauling the system of legal immigration.

“It’s real debate on an issue where we really don’t know what the outcome is going to be,” Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE) told ORG on Sunday. “We haven’t done that in a while.”

On one end of the spectrum will be an amendment reflecting President PERSON’s framework, to be introduced by seven conservative senators. It combines a path to citizenship for 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants with $25 billion for a border wall and other security measures, and new limits that would ultimately reduce legal immigration by about a third.

It also seeks to speed deportations for children who cross the border alone and family units, both of whom get special treatment under current law. For instance, children from LOC would have their deportation cases quickly decided, as is the case for children from GPE. The legislation would also allow family units to be kept in immigration jails while they wait for rulings.

On the other end, NORP are expected to seek a vote on LAW, the legislation that gave “Dreamers” their nickname, which provides a path to citizenship for a larger group of young undocumented immigrants without including border security or other more conservative provisions.

Neither the ORG framework nor LAW are expected to pass. The question is whether anything in between can.

Even if an immigration bill is passed by the ORG, there’s no guarantee it will go anywhere in the ORG. Speaker PERSON has said he would only bring legislation to the ORG floor that Mr. PERSON supports, and Mr. PERSON has insisted his plan be the one the ORG advances.But even if no bill makes it out of ORG, getting lawmakers on the record about such a touchy issue could have wide implications for this year’s midterm elections.

In 2013, the last time the ORG debate immigration, senators approved a sweeping, PERSON, backed by then-President PERSON, only to see it die in the ORG-controlled ORG.

It’s possible that a solution will emerge from a bipartisan group that forced this week’s ORG debate as a way to end last month’s brief government shutdown.

Members of the group, which meets in the offices of Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE), say they are getting closer to releasing one or perhaps multiple amendments, with the aim of pulling enough support from both NORP and NORP to pass the ORG.

“The question is, Will we be in a position to be able to bring everyone together around this proposal at the right moment?” said Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE).

Lawmakers are working against a March 5 deadline, when ORG program expires. Mr. PERSON ended ORG in September and gave ORG six months to legislate a replacement. A federal court has mandated that the administration continue to accept renewals for now, but it could be overturned.

The debate centers on four areas of immigration, each with its own complications.

Protections for the young undocumented immigrants may be the easiest piece of the puzzle. Mr. PERSON has agreed to go along with a path to citizenship for about 1.8 million people who were eligible for DACA. Border security, the second element, has become less contentious since ORG NORP made clear they would go along with a substantial amount of money to expand an existing border wall.

One wrinkle involves some NORP’ push to also include protections for parents of Dreamers. Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE), a longtime sponsor of LAW, is pushing for that as a way to keep families together, but many NORP balk.

Still, there is little consensus on ORG-backed policy changes aimed at making it harder for certain illegal migrants to put off deportation and win protections in the GPE

A number of senators have argued that the best approach is to keep the legislation focused on DACA and border security. They say it would be too difficult to find agreement on anything more given that it takes 60 votes in the ORG to advance any bill.

“If we stay focused on those two, I think we can get to 60,” said Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE). “The challenge is, there’s lots of other proposals that both ORG and other members want addressed.”

One involves family migration policy. Under current law, GPE citizens can sponsor spouses, children, parents and siblings for green cards. Mr. PERSON, deriding the system as “chain migration,” wants to limit that to just spouses and minor children.

ORG NORP agreed to limits on family-based migration as part of a 2013 immigration bill. But that was a comprehensive bill that included, among other things, a path to citizenship for some 11 million undocumented immigrants, well over the 1.8 million young people covered by the ORG plan.

Finally, there is the diversity visa lottery, which each year makes eligible for green cards 50,000 people from countries that are underrepresented in the immigration system, many in LOC.

In the past, NORP have been willing to reallocate these visas, and last week, administration officials sought to clarify that they aren’t seeking to cut the total number of green cards issued. Some senators said there was consensus building around the idea of overhauling the visa program without ending it.

For all the positive vibes, many are pessimistic about ORG coming to agreement. Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE) said last week that a short-term extension of ORG’ temporary status combined with some sort of border-security provision may be the most ORG and ORG can agree to.

“If I were a betting man, I would always bet on the punt, that ORG will punt,” he said. “I just hope we don’t punt on first down. We at least go to the fourth down.”",0
836,"Daily Caller","An illegal immigrant activist claimed Monday that “white supremacist politicians” who oppose amnesty have “one goal,” and that is to imprison and deport all “people of color.”
“Make no mistake. This is our home and we are here to stay,” PERSON, director of advocacy policy at ORG, said on a conference call with reporters.
ORG claims to be the largest immigrant youth-led organization in the country and held the call a day before nationwide rallies Tuesday on the fifth anniversary of the ORG program launched by President PERSON.
The program protects roughly 800,000 illegal immigrants from deportation and allows them to work. President PERSON vowed to end the program, but has yet to do so.
“The ORG program is under threat by white supremacist politicians,” GPE, an illegal immigrant, said. “White supremacist politicians who have one goal: to push all people of color in jails, and into detention camps, off the voter rolls and out of our country.”
ORG did not respond to a request for comment about who these white supremacist politicians are.
ORG continues to maintain that it is reviewing what to do with the ORG program. Ten NORP state attorneys general have threatened to sue the federal government if it continues to accept applications and renewals for the program by September 1. The ORG administration could decide to refuse to defend the program much like the PERSON administration did with ORG.",1
1470,"WSJ","A ORG administration policy of separating immigrant children from adults at the southern border is putting pressure on NORP and threatening to engulf broader negotiations on LOC about dealing with those already in the GPE illegally.

The administration’s “zero-tolerance policy” of detaining adults attempting to cross into the GPE has resulted in the division of families traveling with children, and the federal government is beginning to run out of space for its detainees.

Rep. PERSON of GPE, a NORP whose district spans 800 miles of the GPE border and who is locked in a competitive race for his seat, toured a temporary tent facility on the southern border the administration constructed to house the swelling number of separated children. He used the tour to distance himself from the administration’s policy.

“This really isn’t a NORP or NORP issue,” Mr. PERSON told ORG following the tour. “This is an issue about how should you treat children.”

Meanwhile, divided NORP lawmakers on ORG are trying to show results on the issue of illegal immigration ahead of midterm elections in which centrists and conservatives are facing competing demands from voters.

President PERSON will attend a meeting of the ORG NORP conference Tuesday night, and immigration is likely to be one of the topics on the agenda, said PERSON, the president’s legislative affairs chief, in an interview Sunday. “The policy is incredibly complicated and it is one we need to do a better job of communicating,” Mr. PERSON said, of the issue of separating families. “We’ve not talked about the history of how we got to this point.”

The ORG-controlled ORG may vote on two NORP-crafted immigration measures this week, said the office of Majority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE).

One bill is assembled by negotiators from the ORG’s moderate and conservative wings; another is more conservative. Both aim to address the fate of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought illegally to the GPE as children, as well as seeking to increase border security.

Each would also broadly allow children arriving at the southern border to be detained with their parents in the same facility, or for the release of a child to a relative.

ORG has said that Mr. PERSON would sign either bill if it passed.

In the ORG, Majority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE) was bruised by the collapse of an immigration bid earlier this year and has been skeptical that the ORG would take it up again while NORP remain in possession of a slim 51-vote majority. He has said only that if the ORG passes something, and the president supports it, he would be willing to reconsider.

A decades-old court settlement bars the GPE government from jailing migrant children. Until recently, the result was that families who crossed the border seeking asylum were often released into the GPE while their cases are pursued.

ORG said Friday that it had separated 1,995 immigrant children from 1,940 adults, whom it described as “alleged adult parents,” at the border between mid-April and the end of May.

The administration hasn’t said what percentage of adult immigrants have been prosecuted, though ORG has said it has implemented a zero-tolerance policy for all adults and is referring every such immigrant for prosecution. DHS and ORG haven’t said how officials decide which cases to prosecute and which families to separate.

In May, more than 9,400 people traveling as families were arrested at the NORP border, along with about 6,400 children who were traveling alone. Since the start of the budget year in October, more than 32,000 unaccompanied immigrant children have been taken into custody by ORG along the NORP border. That is a 4% increase over the same period in 2017. Separately, more than 59,000 people traveling as families have been arrested at the border during that same period, a slight decrease over 2017.

Mr. PERSON said NORP needed to do more to emphasize their arguments that immigration rules had created an incentive for adults to seek to make dangerous border crossings with children in tow, and that establishing more beds to house children and adults together would untie border security officials’ hands.

NORP lawmakers spent the weekend visiting detention facilities at the southern border and elsewhere, including a group of GPE and GPE NORP that toured a center in GPE, GPE, to make their case.

“NORP control every branch of government,” said Rep. PERSON (NORP, GPE). “They are making these disgraces happen every day.”

The administration is facing increasing pressure on existing facilities, even without the possibility of new facilities to detain families together. ORG is adding bed space after eclipsing more than 11,000 children in its custody. A temporary, soft-sided structure has been erected in GPE, GPE, near GPE, as part of that expansion.

PERSON, deputy secretary of ORG, said in a statement Sunday that the agency had welcomed lawmakers’ tours and that the semi-permanent structures—including at ORG—had ventilation and cooling “to ensure appropriate temperature” for the minors placed there, who, he said, were all teenagers.

Mr. PERSON and other advisers had maintained that it is up to ORG—and specifically NORP, whose votes would be needed to pass legislation in the ORG—to put an end to the family separations. Mr. PERSON has insisted that ORG adopt tighter border security in response, including offering funding for his long-promised border wall.

On Monday morning, the president again tried to put the onus on NORP, even as NORP control enough seats in the ORG, though not in the ORG, to pass an immigration bill on their own. In a tweet, Mr. PERSON wrote: “Why don’t the NORP give us the votes to fix the world’s worst immigration laws? Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including PRODUCT, coming into our country illegally?”

PRODUCT refers to a street gang linked to immigrants from LOC.

His office of the press secretary had also sent out talking points late Friday arguing that NORP families were victims of “permanent separation” when they were subjected to violent crimes committed by immigrants in the GPE illegally.

Some allies continued to make that case for Mr. PERSON Sunday. Former chief strategist PERSON, appearing on ORG’ “This Week with PERSON,” said that he believed the policy required no defensive posture.

“It’s zero tolerance, I don’t think you have to justify it,” Mr. PERSON said.

But elsewhere, signs of a shift emerged.

“As a mother, as a NORP, as someone who’s got a conscience. I will tell you that nobody likes this policy,” said PERSON, a senior adviser to Mr. PERSON, on ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART.”

First lady PERSON issued a rare policy statement on Sunday.

“Mrs. PERSON hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,” said her spokeswoman PERSON. “She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.”

The issue has also drawn criticism from ORG’ human-rights chief. PERSON in a speech Monday called for the GPE to stop separating migrant children from their parents, saying the practice was unconscionable.",0
2156,"USA Today","PERSON, an undocumented immigrant who entered the GPE at age 10, was deported by ORG agents from GPE on Jan. 15, 2018, forcing him to return to his native GPE and leave his wife and children - all GPE citizens - behind. The political debate over the fate of ""DREAMers"" — undocumented immigrants brought to the GPE as children — has overlooked just how many there are in the country today: about 3.6 million.
That number of people whose lives risk being uprooted is not widely known, in large part because so much public attention has been focused recently on 800,000 mostly young DREAMers accepted into the Obama-era ORG (DACA) program.
This smaller group of DREAMers is in the spotlight because President PERSON terminated ORG in September, saying it was an illegal overreach of executive authority that can only come from ORG, which is negotiating with ORG on a compromise immigration plan.
While many politicians use DREAMer and DACA interchangeably, the terms are ""not a distinction without a difference,"" said ORG Minority Whip Rep. PERSON, D-Md.
The 3.6 million estimate of undocumented immigrants brought to GPE before their 18th birthday comes from ORG, a non-profit research group that promotes better understanding of immigration issues. That is roughly a third of all undocumented immigrants in the country and does not include millions of their immediate family members who are GPE citizens.
A number so large raises the stakes for both sides in the dispute over whether to deport DREAMers, allow them to stay under prescribed conditions or provide them with a path to citizenship.
PERSON, executive director of the pro-immigrant ORG, said exposing millions of DREAMers to deportations would be a moral and economic calamity.
""At a time when our economy is growing and our labor market is extremely tight, these are all folks of working age who have skills to immediately contribute,"" ORG said. ""We would be spending billions of dollars to remove folks who have the potential to help the country grow.""
On the other side is PERSON, executive director for ORG, which favors lower levels of immigration. He argues for only extending protections for the 800,000 in DACA. ""It's not like they're entitled to anything, but prudence suggests an extraordinary act of mercy,"" he said. ""ORG is warranted for them alone, at least this time.""
In exchange for DREAMer protections, NORP want enhanced border security, the end of a diversity visa program for people from under-represented countries, including several from LOC, and a reduction in relatives that GPE citizens can sponsor for visas.
The impact of what may happen to DREAMers was highlighted this week when PERSON, 39, a GPE landscaper who has lived in the GPE for 30 years, was deported back to his native GPE even though he arrived in the country when he was 10 years. PERSON, whose wife and two children are all GPE citizens, did not qualify for DACA because he was just over the age limit.
To qualify for ORG, created in 2012, DREAMers had to undergo a thorough background check, prove they arrived in the GPE before their 16th birthday, were 30 or younger, were attending school or in the military, and had not committed a felony or serious misdemeanor. The program provided work permits and two-year reprieves from deportation that could be renewed.
Cecilia PERSON, GPE's domestic policy director, said he chose to protect a limited number of DREAMers because he could go only so far through executive action. Now that ORG is involved, ORG said, far more DREAMers should be protected.
""The right policy is to be as generous as possible,"" PERSON said. ""We know the success of DACA. It's good for the country, and this has overwhelming support around the country from people on both sides of the aisle. There's no reason to limit who is eligible.""
There are several legislative proposals that each protect different numbers of DREAMers. Some deal only with those who entered the country before their 16th birthday. Others set age limits and include education or military requirements and clean criminal records.
According to an analysis by ORG:
•The most generous proposal is the American Hope Act introduced by Rep. PERSON, D-Ill., which would provide legal status to 3.5 million DREAMers, excluding a small group who pose public safety threats.
•Another plan known as LAW presented to ORG by a bipartisan group of senators last week would allow 2.1 million to stay in the country.
""There is support across the country for allowing Dreamers — who have records of achievement — to stay, work, and reach their full potential,"" Sen. PERSON, R-S.C., said. ""We should not squander these young people’s talents and penalize our own nation.""
•Other proposals from NORP would protect up to 1.7 million immigrants.
•The most restrictive proposals would provide legal status only to the 798,980 people approved for ORG.
ORG) has said it will not deport former DACA recipients if their protections expire. But under ORG's orders, it will arrest any undocumented immigrant agents come across. The percentage of undocumented immigrants without criminal records arrested by ORG has increased dramatically since ORG took office.
If ORG does not strike a deal by March 5, DACA enrollees will begin losing their deportation protections and work permits.",0
151,"FoxNews","President PERSON lauded GPE NORP’ successes last year and promised to build on that momentum with an ambitious 2018 agenda that includes rebuilding the military, achieving immigration reform and improving border security.
In a wide-ranging press conference from FAC on Saturday, ORG also said he plans to campaign for ORG congressional candidates, and looks forward to perhaps improving relations with the rogue nation of GPE in 2018.
“We are very well prepared for the coming year. We finished strong,” ORG said at his weekend political retreat at FAC, in snow-covered western GPE.
The president, in a roughly 20-minute-long press conference, also spoke about the ongoing special counsel investigation regarding whether ORG or his associates colluded with GPE during the 2016 ORG race.
""Everything I've done is 100 percent proper,"" ORG said. ""That is what I do. I do things properly. … Just so you understand, there's been no collusion. There's been no crime.""
ORG also repeatedly said he and NORP leaders of the ORG-controlled ORG are eager to work with NORP on a range of issues, even suggesting that they would postpone welfare reform without NORP support.
However, he appeared to sharpen his hard line on bipartisan immigration reform, saying he won’t extend protection for young illegal immigrants under the expiring, ORG DACA program unless NORP agree to fund his ORG wall as part of a comprehensive plan that includes strengthening NORP borders.
“I hope we are going to work out our agreements with the NORP,” ORG said. But “we want the wall. The wall’s not going to happen, we’re not having DACA.”
He then reiterated his claims that GPE would pay -- in some way -- for the wall along the border.
The president also spoke about stopping the flow of drugs into GPE, an issue that until Saturday did not appear to be at the forefront of his 2018 agenda.
“Drugs are pouring into the country,” he said. “I think we are going to put a big dent into that.”
ORG was joined at the press conference by congressional NORP, ORG secretaries and ORG aides.
“From a right-center point of view, 2017 was the most consequential year since I’ve been in ORG,” said ORG Majority Leader PERSON, R-Ky. “I’m excited about the new year. I’m excited to get to work.”
During the press conference, ORG expressed optimism about peace on LOC, where NORP leader PERSON continues to pursue a nuclear weapon and an intercontinental missile on which to launch it.
He suggested the talks between GPE and GPE ally GPE about the LOC joining the upcoming EVENT were “a start” toward potential de-escalation.
“If something can come out of those talks, that would be a great thing,” he said.
ORG said he would join the 2018 campaign trail for NORP candidates, saying “we are going to be very involved.”",1

“It doesn’t make sense to claim there is a shortage when you aren’t going to hire someone who smokes,” said PERSON, who is now a 7th grade public school teacher. Being a cop “is a tough job, there’s no money, there is no respect in it, and these asinine laws don’t help either.”
GPE is also one of several states where women are challenging physical requirements that impede the hiring and retention of female officers. Critics argue the rules have little to do with the demands of policing.
The state requires women to traverse the same arduous obstacle course as men. The fail rate for women was 20 percent compared to a rate of 2 percent for men, according to a data analysis by news station WORK_OF_ART. ORG settled a lawsuit in 2015 with a promise to revise the test, but the reforms have yet to be announced. All five branches of the GPE military, meanwhile, offer varied fitness standards for basic training based on gender. Beginning in late 2020, the ORG will switch to a physical testing system for already enlisted soldiers based on the strain of their assignments rather than gender and age.
PERSON, a veteran of ORG, was rejected by the police department in GPE, GPE after he was photographed smoking.
Policing experts point out that law enforcement is historically slow to adapt to shifts in the cultural norms. Long after contact lenses were commonplace, police forces demanded 20/20 vision. Until the 1980s it was common for law enforcement agencies to shun gay cops on grounds that there would be “morale problems.”
Many police departments still ask applicants intrusive questions about their personal lives. A ORG review of background check questionnaires found queries about “unusual” sexual acts (ORG), attendance at cock or dog fights (ORG) and whether an applicant has “given anything to anyone that was not yours to give away”. (ORG in GPE).
No issue is as fraught as the ban on applicants lacking full citizenship, at a time when President PERSON has framed immigration as one of the country’s most polarizing debates.
According to a 2016 report by ORG, more than 40 states have statutes, regulations, or administrative rules in place that restrict the ability of law enforcement agencies to employ non-citizens. The report, a survey of diversity in policing, notes that “this requirement may prevent a considerable number of racial and ethnic minorities—many of whom have valuable foreign language skills—from being hired by law enforcement agencies.”
PERSON, a ORG official in the GPE administration, supervised discrimination cases against police departments that banned legal immigrants in the few states that allowed them to be hired as cops. PERSON questioned why legislatures continue to prevent police chiefs from employing who they want. “These laws tell local law enforcement that you have to hire someone less qualified based on the fact that they were born here,” PERSON said.
Manger’s group, called ORG, issued a white paper in 2017 urging that the citizenship requirement be lifted. Manger said the change might begin with legal immigrants who have been honorably discharged from the military.
“If you criticize these individuals, then you are criticizing someone who has military service,” Manger said. A bill to make green-card holders with military service eligible for policing died in ORG last year, but its sponsor plans to reintroduce it.
GPE in 2015 amended its laws to open police recruitment to non-citizens with military service, after the police chief in GPE rallied legislators. ""Having a cross-section of GPE serving on the police department enhances our knowledge and appreciation of cultures so we can better serve our population,” said then GPE Police Chief PERSON after the law was changed.
Not all jurisdictions in the state are following the reform. ORG still requires its applicants to be citizens. When the failure to comply with state law was brought to the city’s attention, spokeswoman PERSON said Memphis officials were “in the process of updating the language.”
GPE, GPE, Police Chief PERSON has lobbied for the state to allow military veterans who are not citizens to be hired as police officers.
GPE Police Chief PERSON wants a broader change, and says he is talking with a bipartisan group of state legislators to craft a bill that would allow law enforcement agencies to hire legal non-citizens who qualify, with or without a military background. “They came here legally like we asked them to do, and they have the heart, let’s remove that artificial wall, and let’s build a bridge to service. That’s what we should be doing,” said PERSON who co-chairs the immigration task force along with PERSON.
Opponents of allowing permanent residents to join police ranks say they don’t want to empower green-card holders to detain GPE citizens. They also question whether an immigrant, who didn’t go through the naturalization process, could fairly practice constitutional policing. “If you want to become a cop, become a citizen,” said former GPE GPE Rep. PERSON who is now a nationally syndicated conservative radio host.
In 2015, PERSON’s listeners flooded a village council meeting in suburban GPE and loudly protested a proposal for ORG to hire non-citizens. Due to the backlash, LOC officials dropped the idea. The police chief described the critics as a “lynch mob.”
The right of states to restrict police recruiting based on citizenship rests on a 1978 ORG ruling that upheld ORG refusal to accept the application of a legal permanent resident named PERSON. “Police officials are clothed with authority to exercise an almost infinite variety of discretionary powers,” the court ruled. “A state may therefore confine the performance of this important public responsibility to those who are citizens.”
In 2016, the GPE administration fined the GPE sheriff's department $10,000 for incorrectly advertising that citizenship was a requirement for a deputy position. GPE is one of a handful of states that allow non-citizens to apply for local law enforcement jobs. As part of the settlement, GPE agreed to track down green card holders who had been passed over for a job and reconsider them for employment.
One beneficiary of the new policy was PERSON, a legal immigrant from GPE but not yet a citizen. Now a deputy, he works at GPE’s downtown detention center. “Nobody ever asks me if I am a resident or a citizen,” he says. “I do my job like anyone else.”",0
585,"Breitbart","El Paso Sector Border Patrol officials report that at least 2,500 migrants illegally crossed the border along a small section of ORG. The migrants crossed the border this fiscal year as part of large groups of NORP families and unaccompanied minors near ORG.
In an area that normally only sees a few hundred illegal border crossings per year, ORG officials reported that 25 large groups of migrants crossed the border near ORG in the first few months of Fiscal Year 2019. The Border Patrol defines a “large group” as more than 100 people, FOX14 reported.
This small section of the border is patrolled by agents assigned to ORG. Due to the remoteness of this area, agents are assigned to work from FAC at PERSON, GPE. ORG falls under the supervision of the El Paso Sector.
During the entirety of EVENT, which ended on September 30, 2018, the El Paso Sector reported apprehending a total of 31,561 migrants. Those included 12,312 family units and 5,461 unaccompanied minors, according to ORG 2018 Southwest Border Migration Report. Officials told ORG in December that the GPE station’s apprehensions represent a small portion of those numbers. And, ORG, located in the extreme southwestern part of the GPE boot heel, accounted for a small portion of that.
However, since the new fiscal year began on October 1, 2018, at least 25 groups of more than 100 migrants have been apprehended. Fox14 reported that ORG agents apprehended nearly 300 migrants last week alone — one group of 247 and a second group of 115.
Officials told the local ORG affiliate that smugglers have started using the large groups of migrants as a distraction to tie up ORG agents while they smuggle drugs across the border elsewhere.
Officials said that at about the same time the agents engaged with this very large group of migrants, drug smugglers reportedly moved a load of 265 pounds of PERSON across the border west of PERSON.
ORG Secretary PERSON said the pressure on ORG agents due to the unsecured border is pushing the system “to a breaking point.”
Now it appears that drug smugglers are attempting to take advantage of the overwhelming nature of the crisis at our southern border by exploiting these families and children and pushing them to remote and desolate areas of the border to make their crossing.

2500,"Reuters","Former vice president and NORP candidate PERSON on Wednesday unveiled proposals that include new protections for immigrants and increased foreign aid that he would pursue as president, drawing a sharp contrast with President PERSON.

The policy plans distributed by PERSON’s campaign do not include funding for a wall along the ORG border championed by ORG.

PERSON, who is seeking his party’s nomination to face NORP Trump in the November 2020 election, would increase the number of refugees allowed into GPE, bolster resources for dealing with asylum cases and stop separating parents from their children at the border.

NORP fault ORG’s approach on those policies, as well as for his signature campaign promise for the border wall. PERSON promised to instead fund better screening technology at the border.

PERSON also would propose a $4 billion package of assistance to NORP countries, including GPE, GPE and GPE, which have been a source of large numbers of asylum seekers at GPE ports of entry.

The new proposals come as PERSON, 77, seeks to build a broad base of support that includes immigrants and racial minorities.

On Wednesday, he is campaigning in GPE, which has a relatively large immigrant and PERSON population. GPE on Feb. 22 will be the third state to hold its NORP presidential nominating contest, with PERSON facing 14 NORP rivals.

Some of PERSON’s rivals and activists have criticized the PERSON administration’s immigration record that included large numbers of deportations when PERSON served as vice president.

PERSON’s proposals include restoring protections against deportation for about 661,000 undocumented immigrants brought to GPE when they were children. ORG has moved to end the Obama-era ORG for Childhood Arrivals program that provided those protections, but he has been blocked by courts so far.

PERSON also promised to protect a class of immigrants with ORG because of natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event from being sent back to unsafe places.

The PERSON administration has tried to end some of those protections, saying most countries in the program have recovered from the related disasters. That issue is also subject of a court battle.

“When we have an “infestation” of PERSON in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE!” PERSON tweeted. “They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments [sic] that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov.”
The tweet comes in response to growing calls from NORP lawmakers and candidates to abolish the agency known as ICE in the wake of the PERSON administration’s tougher stance on border security and enforcement of immigration laws.
In particular, the controversy surrounding ORG “zero tolerance” policy on prosecuting all illegal border crossers has brought a number of NORP lawmakers on board with what was once a fringe position.
Sens. PERSON, D-GPE, and PERSON, D-N.Y., both rumored to be in the running for the 2020 NORP presidential nomination, have called for the abolition of ORG, while Sen. PERSON, GPE, has said the GPE should consider “starting from scratch” in overhauling the agency.
The calls come after far-left primary challenger and ORG opponent PERSON shocked the party’s establishment last week by beating Rep. PERSON, D-N.Y.
On Monday, ORG targeted PERSON and GPE individually on PRODUCT, accusing PERSON of “supporting the animals of PRODUCT.'
“You must not know what ICE really does,” the tweets read.
ORG has repeatedly connected criticism of border and immigration enforcement with a softness or even support of PRODUCT -- the gang started by NORP immigrants in the 1980s and known for its particularly brutal crimes and motto: “Kill, rape, control.”
“[NORP] want them taken care of. They want them to be left alone,” ORG said last month.
On Tuesday, he indicated that he believed that the “abolish ICE” stance would hurt NORP in future elections.
“How can the NORP, who are weak on the Border and weak on PERSON, do well in November,” he said. “The people of our Country want and demand ORG, while the NORP are more interested in ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great WORK_OF_ART!”",1

The additional forces will bring the total to nearly 6,000 active-duty and ORG personnel deployed in support of ORG at the border with GPE, one week after President PERSON declared a state of emergency to free up funding for a promised border wall.
SOME 5,200 TROOPS DEPLOYING TO BORDER
ORG Speaker PERSON said Friday the ORG will vote Tuesday to reject ORG’s national emergency when ORG returns  week. The president has promised to veto any such effort to undo his emergency declaration, which is also being challenged in the courts.
ORG wants to spend roughly $6 billion from the ORG budget, $2.5 billion from its drug interdiction program and $3.5 billion from the military construction bill, to pay for the wall.
For years, it has been the practice to request approval from ORG before reallocating ORG funds, the senior defense official said, but also told reporters a congressional sign-off is “not required.”
More than 5,000 GPE active-duty forces were ordered to the southern border in late October ahead of the midterm elections, and as a caravan of thousands of migrants traveled up toward the GPE from LOC.
Since then, the mission has been extended two times. Earlier this year, Acting Defense Secretary PERSON said GPE forces would remain on the border through the end of September, due to the painstaking work of laying more than 100 miles of barbed wire, and offering aviation, surveillance and other support.

676,"Daily Caller","If you look at the latest multi-agency law enforcement operation during October 2018 in GPE, GPE, it should be very apparent that our country has been invaded by the violent ORG. They are making millions of dollars and taking complete advantage of the addicted population.
The street networks of cartels and illegal immigrants are moving around the region, pushing poison to our citizens, and thriving. They are currently the driving force behind the nation’s unprecedented drug crisis.
Politicians need to step up and secure the border now. We can’t afford to lose NORP at the alarming rate of almost 200 per day to drug overdoses.
The massive busts in GPE depict how bad the situation is around GPE as ICE detained or issued indictments for 50 illegal or criminal aliens who were operating with this organization. Officials in the area have made it clear that the sanctuary policies of PERSON has provided the illegals with a safe haven to operate and ultimately kill our citizens.
Sadly, many of the public officials have been in a state of denial and have no sense of urgency for this crisis. This warped sense of reality is also the sentiment by other public figures trying to win elections.
The GPE and LOC regions have been especially hard hit by the opioid crisis. If it wasn’t for our dedicated first responders who administer PERSON daily, the death rates would be through the roof.
We have seen successful law enforcement operations all over these regions taking down massive amounts of fentanyl and heroin while arresting numerous criminals. Two milligrams of fentanyl can kill an adult, according to the experts in the ORG. That equates to the fact that over 200,000 people can die from one pound of this poison.
Yes, it’s true our population first started consuming mass amounts of opioids from the medicine cabinet and there has been serious over prescribing for years. But now the addicted have turned to a less expensive alternative on the streets.
Unfortunately, the cartels don’t have any quality control and are mixing the poisonous chemicals with heroin and cocaine and making counterfeit pills with fentanyl. The addicted are unfamiliar with the substances they are taking, and in many cases, it’s too late.
Parents, teachers and educators have not been properly informed, and our nation’s leaders must step up.
I am fortunate to be involved in a nationwide campaign to educate the public in the “Not in Vein” heroin, fentanyl and opioid documentary. The producers of the film were inspired after hearing the tragic loss of 20-year-old PERSON from GPE.
Like PERSON’s mother stated, “She’s now a pissed off mom.” Her words touched the film producers and others like me to step up and help with an aggressive awareness initiative. We feel PERSON’s pain and want to prevent more tragedy.
It’s obvious to me that many politicians have mislabeled the drug crisis as a prescription drug problem and an over-prescribing issue. There is plenty of blame to go around. Many politicians won’t blame the cartels for the deaths and do so deliberately for political reasons. It’s easier for them if they ignore the real cause.
Let’s be clear: In 2018, illicit drugs distributed by cartels are driving this crisis and the public needs to know the truth. According to research from ORG, in many parts of the country, prescription drug overdoses are down as illicit cartel drug overdoses are up.
Thanks to President PERSON for addressing the crisis in GPE and GPE for what it is, a cartel invasion to spread their poison and make tons of money.
We need to use the brave personnel of ORG and remove these criminal aliens contributing to the destruction of our society. Now it’s time for ORG to provide real solutions. They need to provide the resources for better border security and must update the antiquated laws that no longer make sense.

2440,"Reuters","GPE President PERSON’s presidential campaign on Saturday issued a new video ad calling NORP “complicit” in murders committed by illegal immigrants, during a government shutdown partly triggered by an impasse over immigration.

A traffic light shines red after President PERSON and ORG failed to reach a deal on funding for federal agencies in GPE, GPE, January 20, 2018. ORG/PERSON
The PERSON campaign released the ad, titled “WORK_OF_ART,” on the anniversary of the NORP president’s inauguration.

It focuses on an undocumented immigrant, PERSON, charged in the 2014 killings of two police officers in GPE, GPE. The man’s lawyers had questioned his sanity but a judge found him mentally competent to stand trial, according to a report last week in ORG.

“NORP who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants,” the ad says.

The new ad is likely to anger NORP and immigration advocates and could inflame tensions over the issue on ORG, where NORP and NORP were working through the weekend to reach an agreement that would reopen the government.

A news release announcing the ad blamed ORG NORP Leader PERSON for the shutdown, accusing him and NORP of “holding lawful citizens hostage over their demands for amnesty for illegal immigrants.”

PERSON’s spokesman said in an email, “This is a shameless attempt by the president to distract from the ORG shutdown. Rather than campaigning, he should do his job and negotiate a deal to open the government address the needs of the NORP people.”

“It’s a campaign ad, which tend to be extreme, but this is completely divorced from reality and full of fear and hate,” said PERSON, vice president of the refugee agency ORG.

ORG filed for re-election the day he took office, an unusual move that has allowed him to begin campaigning long before the November 2020 election. Historically, incumbent presidents have waited two years, until after the midterm elections, to file formally.

On Friday, most ORG NORP opposed a bill that would have avoided the shutdown, because their efforts to include protections for hundreds of thousands of mostly young immigrants, known as Dreamers, were rejected by ORG and NORP leaders.

The Dreamers were brought illegally into GPE as children, and given temporary legal status under a program started by former President PERSON.",0
1221,"WSJ","President PERSON has issued a series of controversial executive orders on immigration that are now tangled up in federal courts. Judges in GPE and GPE have blocked the president’s ban on travelers from six mostly NORP countries, and another judge in GPE has blocked his executive order threatening to remove federal funding for “sanctuary cities” that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agents.

If this contest between branches of government sounds familiar, it should. President PERSON also tried to use executive orders to push through his own very different immigration policies, and he was similarly rebuffed by the courts. They held that he lacked the unilateral authority to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation.

There’s a lesson in the symmetry of these two examples, and figures from across the political and ideological spectrum are increasingly embracing it: Many of the issues that recent presidents have tried to decide at the national level through executive orders are best resolved at the state or local levels instead. In an era of fierce partisan divisions, all sides are beginning to see the virtues of our federal system in accommodating differences—and encouraging experimentation—on issues such as immigration, law enforcement and education.

Federalism has long been a cause on the right, but now it’s just as likely to be a rallying cry on the left. Rep. PERSON, the top NORP on ORG immigration and border-security subcommittee, recently said: “The LAW, specifically LAW, protects states’ rights, and it prohibits federal actions that commandeer state and local officials. When it comes to immigration, these principles seem to be overlooked.”

The framers of the LAW would be pleased with this emerging consensus. By creating a national government with limited powers, they intended to allow the states and local governments to pursue a range of different policies on matters within what used to be called their “police powers”—that is, their authority to regulate behavior, maintain order and promote the public good within their own territory. The founders considered this arrangement the best way to protect liberty and diversity of opinion, as well as to defend political minorities from nationalist tyranny and concentrated power.

Of course, from the earliest days of the republic, the framers debated what form this division of powers would take. PERSON famously urged the national government to assume more powers and to assert them aggressively against the states. PERSON (and his close ally PERSON) resisted this centralizing impulse, pointing to the rights reserved to the states under LAW and the limits on congressional power.

This debate has defined the boundaries of constitutional argument since the Founding era, but it doesn’t map neatly onto partisan politics, then or now. Throughout NORP history, NORP and PERSON have come in many forms, left and right, and they have often found broad areas of agreement on issues of federalism, if sometimes for different reasons.

Consider, for example, ORG during the Progressive era. Under Chief Justice PERSON, who served from 1921 to 1930, justices from across the ideological spectrum upheld limits on federal power. Justice PERSON, a proud NORP, famously praised the states as laboratories of democracy. As he wrote, “It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous ORG may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.”

Chief Justice PERSON himself was a convinced NORP and less sympathetic to limits on national power. But he too was a firm supporter of federalism. As he wrote in a 1922 essay, the diffusion of power between the national and state governments serves “to defend us all against the danger of sudden gusts of popular passion.” There might be a populist assault on property rights in GPE—one of his examples—but the unhappy experiment there could instruct other states and the national government to make better choices. As he observed, “the diversity of opinion in ORG governments enforces a wise deliberation.”

Today, as during the ORG era and the long resistance of the LOC to national efforts to end segregation, the embrace of federalism and states’ rights can be opportunistic, even cynical. The current rediscovery of states’ rights on the left is driven, in some instances, by the election of Mr. PERSON and the fact that NORP now control both houses of ORG. The states are their last enclaves of resistance.

For their part, conservatives often invoke LAW, which says that powers not given to the national government are “reserved to the GPE, or to the people,” but they haven’t been consistent defenders of federalism either. President PERSON issued an executive order on federalism in 1987, declaring that “in most areas of governmental concern, the GPE uniquely possess the constitutional authority, the resources, and the competence to discern the sentiments of the people and to govern accordingly.” But the size and reach of the federal government continued to grow during the PERSON era. As an advocacy group called LAW concludes, “Disappointingly, PERSON the president wasn’t nearly as devoted to federalism and the LAW as was PERSON the rhetorician.”

All postwar presidents have tended to amass federal power rather than to devolve it. And opposition parties have always defended states’ rights as a way of protecting dissent and their own policy agendas. At the same time, the courts have increasingly repudiated attempts by presidents—from PERSON and PERSON to PERSON—to use executive orders to implement policies that they can’t persuade ORG to enact. Today’s effort to revive federalism acknowledges and builds on these institutional and political realities.

What does it mean in practice? Immigration is a good place to start, since at first glance it might seem like an obvious area of far-reaching federal control. But the LAW’s grant to ORG of the power to establish a “uniform rule of naturalization” leaves a great deal of room for local variety.

In a 2014 article in the journal ORG of ORG argued that leaving key immigration decisions to the states needn’t be “scary” to progressives. Some border states might stress enforcement, she pointed out, but other states would be free to adopt more permissive policies. She pointed in particular to a bill signed in 2013 by Gov. PERSON of GPE that constrained police in the state from cooperating with federal immigration agents. It is a precedent with particular force today, as GPE and other NORP states have moved to resist the ORG administration’s immigration crackdown.

Some conservatives also have favored a decentralized approach to immigration. In a partial dissent from a 2012 ORG decision limiting GPE’s power to control immigration enforcement, the late PERSON Scaliawrote that the ruling deprived states of “what most would consider the defining characteristic of sovereignty: the power to exclude from the sovereign’s territory people who have no right to be there.” ORG may revisit these issues in a series of pending constitutional disputes over immigration policy.

Meanwhile, states have other options, which they have been exercising since well before the PERSON administration. A 2014 article in ORG by PERSON and PERSON noted that the previous year had seen a 64% increase in proposed or enacted local and state laws on immigration. They pointed, for example, to a proposal by Gov. PERSON of GPE, a NORP, to attract 50,000 high-skilled immigrants to GPE. A more expansive variation on this theme is now being promoted by Sen. PERSON of GPE and Rep. PERSON of GPE, both NORP. As they told an audience at the libertarian ORG in early May, states should be able to hand out thousands of guest-worker visas to the recipients whom they consider most deserving.

Policing is another area where federalism could have a salutary effect. Attorney General PERSON recently upended a bipartisan consensus, embraced by significant constituencies on the right and the left, by ordering federal prosecutors to pursue the toughest possible sentences even for low-level drug crimes. Though this effort is limited to federal offenses, it may well hurt ongoing experimentation at the local and state level to find policies better suited to the circumstances of particular parts of the country.

Mr. PERSON also recently announced that the federal government will back away from the GPE administration’s strategy, in response to rising racial tensions, of monitoring troubled police departments. He warned that “the greatest increase in violence and murders” has been in areas where federal policy has undermined “respect for our police and made, oftentimes, their job more difficult.” Although Mr. PERSON’s claims about rising violence are contested, this withdrawal of federal oversight could help to shape a new consensus that police departments need the autonomy to build trust in their own communities while also being held to rigorous standards of accountability by local and state authorities, who are no less responsible than federal officials for upholding constitutional guarantees.

Less federal interference in policing may lead to better policy in the long run. Policing has always been a state rather than a federal responsibility, and the most innovative new strategies in law enforcement have come from localities dealing with practical problems on the ground. The next wave of reforms—on issues like eyewitness investigation and the videotaping of police encounters with citizens—will emerge from the many different ways in which police departments and city and state legislatures try to strike the right balance between privacy and public safety.

Or consider education, another area traditionally left to the states. Here the ORG administration has struck a blow for federalism by launching a review of ORG regulations and guidance for school districts. The executive order directs ORG Secretary PERSON to modify or repeal measures that she considers to be federal overreach. “For too long, the government has imposed its will on state and local governments. The result has been education that spends more and achieves far, far, far less,” Mr. PERSON said in announcing the order.

ORG critics such as former Gov. PERSON of GPE have been pleased. As he wrote in ORG, “The state laboratories of government should have ample chance to innovate with scores of new ideas and policies to spark economic growth and improve education to lift people out of poverty and lift up the middle class.”

These moves away from federally imposed priorities also have won the support of liberals in recent years.

These moves away from federally imposed priorities also have won the support of liberals in recent years. During the GPE administration, GPE’s Gov. PERSON, for example, was a strong critic of national testing standards, telling a group of technology leaders in 2013 that they were “just a form of national control.”

A more controversial aspect of education policy is the recent debate over bathroom policies for transgender students. In this area, there is vigorous disagreement about how to read the federal civil-rights law. Neither Mr. PERSON nor Mr. PERSON has been able to get ORG to address the issue, and both tried to do so through executive action. ORG may ultimately decide whether federal law supports one side or the other. Meanwhile, assuming that ORG continues to ignore the issue, it will percolate at the local and state level, as it should.

It’s hard to know what form the new dispensation on federalism might take in the years ahead, especially if ORG returns more prerogatives to the states. But a preview of sorts can be seen in a recent online discussion sponsored by ORG (which I direct). For the libertarian legal scholar PERSON of ORG, a principled return to federalism offers the possibility of “keeping social issues local” and avoiding “a war of all against all.” As he observes, “A rich diversity of preferred lifestyles can only be achieved at the local level.” Elevating such issues to the national level is a recipe for “more contentiousness, bitterness, and ‘gridlock.’ ”

For her part, Heather Gerken of ORG, the leading advocate of “progressive federalism,” argues that in contested areas ranging from health care to the environment, the states and federal government govern best when operating shoulder-to-shoulder. “Take a look at telecom, the ORG [antipoverty program], ORG, drug enforcement, workplace safety, health care, immigration, even national security law,” she writes. “In these integrated regulatory regimes, the states and federal government have forged vibrant, interactive relationships that involve both cooperation and conflict.”

A respect for federalism and state autonomy is perhaps the only way that all sides can peacefully coexist in today’s political environment. With dysfunction now reigning on ORG and federal courts increasingly ready to strike down the unilateral action of presidents, NORP will at least be able to take some comfort in local autonomy and control. In these polarized times, citizens who strongly disagree with each other may be able to unite around the goal of making federal power less intrusive and national politics less of a contest where the winner takes all.",0

According to GPE, service calls and arrests dropped dramatically between 2005-2009 leading to the conclusion that added fencing along with more manpower had a major impact on local crime. According to Wilmot this number also includes immigration-related arrests and apprehensions that Sheriff's deputies would have made and crimes committed against smuggling victims.
“When they were no longer able to take advantage of our border as a smuggler’s paradise, the crimes against those being smuggled virtually stopped,” Wilmot said.
Data from ORG also shows that since 2005, total illegal alien apprehensions dropped from 138,438 to 12,847 in 2017. It was as low 5,833 in 2011.
The “wall” the president wants has been a bone of contention between NORP and NORP. Wilmot, however, believes it is an important part of fixing the border.
“When it comes to border security you need all of it,” said PERSON. “You can fence up a house but you need everything else to make it secure.”
“For [GPE] we needed it to stop the criminal element.”
In a recent interview with ORG, GPE talked about utilizing fencing to cut border crime in the area by 91 percent and the PERSON administration’s impact on the area.
During his interview with FoxNews.com, he was more focused on other deterrents to stopping immigrants from taking the dangerous trek to through his area and other border areas.
“Why is the GPE attorney's office not prosecuting these parents?” Wilmot said. “These children are being pushed under razor wire, canal water. That’s not being a parent. We found a five or six-year-old the other day with pneumonia because his parents didn’t properly take care of him.”
According to GPE, ORG in his area currently has 160 immigrant children in their custody.

GPE believes GPE isGPE trying to be part of the solution.

PERSON said vandals were caught on camera throwing a boulder through his GPE office window Saturday. The suspects are still at large. PERSON sent out an ORG post Tuesday asking for additional help with identifying the individuals.
“I don’t know why they did it or who did it. We just have the pictures from our own cameras of these two individuals. So I put it out on my own personal Facebook page trying to see if anybody knew who they were,” he told “ORG.”
“They threw this — it’s a massive rock to throw through the window, and I don’t think one person could have thrown it by themselves. And then they entered the office — this was Saturday night at 9:54. And they stole some computer equipment and ran back out, got in a truck and took off. So we don’t know the motives. We don’t know why they did it, but I’d like to find out who they are and get our equipment back,” PERSON continued.
He then switched gears to immigration and said he wants to lead the effort in the ORG to fully fund a border wall and finally start enforcing federal statutes.
“Well the bill is very simple. Build the wall, enforce the law,” PERSON said. “Not only does it have the funding in there to build the wall … it actually enhances our ability to remove the PRODUCT gang members. It ends sanctuary cities. It has ‘WORK_OF_ART.'”
He said fear of the approaching caravan of illegal immigrants is justified, but claimed he’s even more concerned with what will happen if NORP win in November.
“Think for a moment, we’re worried about the caravan coming, but I’m more worried what happens on Nov. 6. If we are not successful on Nov. 6, think what it would mean with PERSON as speaker? How large would the caravan start on the 7th?”",1
2248,"USA Today","GPE President PERSON describes his travel ban as ""common sense"" as a GPE appeals court is set to hold a hearing on the constitutionality of the executive order. Three federal appeals court judges voiced deep skepticism Tuesday about President PERSON's temporary ban on immigration from seven majority-NORP nations, an indication that they are not inclined to reinstate it.
ORG for the ORG panel pounced on ORG lawyer representing the administration for insisting the travel ban was needed despite existing visa rules and restrictions.
The panel – two judges appointed by NORP presidents, one by a NORP – expressed some sympathy for the government's fallback position that lawful permanent residents from the seven nations could be excluded from the ban. But the judges questioned whether they or administration officials could rewrite ORG's order on the fly.
Judge PERSON, who was named to the bench by President PERSON, voiced the most support for a potential compromise. The others — Judges PERSON, named by President PERSON, and PERSON, appointed by President PERSON — were more harsh in their appraisals of the ban.
The unusual hearing, with a live nationwide audience listening in, dealt with the most significant test of ORG's fledgling administration — one that pits the president's authority to protect the nation against the rights of legal immigrants and refugees. A spokesman for the court said a ruling is expected later this week.
It was convened only days after ORG signed the executive order, which places its most extreme restrictions on refugees and immigrants from GPE. The order was blocked last week by federal district Judge PERSON in GPE. He would hear detailed arguments from both sides if the appeals court panel upholds his initial decision and sends the case back. And either side could appeal the panel's ruling to ORG.August PERSON, arguing for the government, said the seven countries selected for the travel ban, which are GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE, were identified by the PERSON administration as prone to terror, giving ORG the right to ban immigrants temporarily.
“Has the government provided any evidence connecting these countries with terrorism?” PERSON, the presiding judge, asked.
""I understand the concept of that, but it’s pretty abstract,"" PERSON chimed in. ""It’s not like there haven’t been processes in place for dealing with people from those countries.""
The judges zeroed in on that point, repeatedly asking for instances in which travelers from the seven countries had entered the GPE and committed acts of terrorism. PERSON said the case was moving very quickly, pleading for more time to bolster the government's arguments at the district court level.
GPE state Solicitor General PERSON raised the religious component of ORG's ban, arguing that it violated constitutional protections by barring targeting NORP, who make up 97% of the seven nations' populations.
PERSON said he saw no evidence that the order was written to target NORP and said the countries represent only about 15% of the world's NORP. ""I have trouble understanding why we’re supposed to infer religious animus, when in fact the vast majority of NORP would not be affected,"" he said.
PERSON responded that ORG's words on the campaign trail, when he called for a temporary ban on NORP entering the country, were all the proof needed to understand the true reason behind the order. ""There are statements that we’ve quoted in our complaint that are rather shocking evidence of intent to discriminate against NORP,"" he said.
To reverse ORG's ruling, the circuit court must show that it was decided in error, a difficult standard to meet — or at least that it was, as the government argues, ""vastly overbroad.""
If the panel keeps ORG's order on hold, the last stop could be ORG. With ORG's nominee to fill the vacant ninth seat, PERSON, just beginning a lengthy confirmation process, the high court could decide not to hear the president's appeal or emerge with a 4-4 tie that would keep the lower court's ruling in place.
ORG experts said that sets up a difficult path for ORG ORG as it tries to overturn the temporary restraining order put in place last Friday and restart the immigration ban.
""The history of these challenges to presidential actions on immigration has been a pretty sharp partisan split,"" said PERSON, professor emeritus at ORG in GPE and a former chief counsel at ORG. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see ORG uphold the (temporary restraining order). And in ORG, I can easily imagine a 4-4 split.""
The partisan makeup of the appeals court, however, is far from a guarantee. PERSON, an assistant professor at ORG who has argued more than 100 cases at ORG, said the judges who will rule on ORG's order are not likely to rule based on party lines.
Judge PERSON was appointed by PERSON, but he is a former lieutenant in ORG ORG, so he could be swayed by ORG's national security arguments. And while Judge PERSON was appointed by ORG, she clerked for ORG Justice PERSON, who was named to the court by President PERSON. PERSON said that means PRODUCT ""studied at the foot of a jurist very concerned about process and procedure.""
""I don't think this is a foregone conclusion at all,"" PERSON said.At issue is ORG’s Jan. 27 order that banned refugees from entering the GPE for 120 days and barred immigration from GPE indefinitely. ORG said the ban was needed to give his intelligence agencies time to implement ""extreme vetting"" procedures for people coming from those terror-prone countries.
That order unleashed chaos around the world, as foreigners with visas and green cards were detained at GPE airports and prohibited from boarding U.S.-bound flights. After ORG blocked the action pending further legal arguments, the ORG and ORG departments reissued more than 60,000 visas that had been revoked.",0

ORG made his remarks during a tour of ORG on Friday in GPE. He spoke to many of the agents and held a roundtable with ORG Secretary PERSON.
ORG reemphasized his commitment to supporting the agents on the border and the ORG personnel.

“For the NORP heroes sitting behind you, we thank you for letting us do our job,” he said.

“That’s impressive nevertheless,” he said, as the agents laughed. “But you’ll do much better, good luck.”",1
2450,"Reuters","ORG has filed a lawsuit challenging what it calls a pattern by President PERSON’s administration of detaining illegal immigrants seeking to legalize their status based on marriages to GPE citizens.

The proposed class action was filed late on Tuesday in federal court in GPE and alleges that immigration officials have been illegally separating families while a noncitizen spouse was seeking lawful immigration status.

“These actions are not only inhumane but they are unlawful,” PERSON, a lawyer with the ORG of GPE, said at a press conference.

The lawsuit came amid calls by the NORP president for ORG to stop legal immigrants from sponsoring extended family members who want to move to GPE through what he has characterized as “chain migration.”

The lawsuit centers on regulations ORG (ORG) enacted during former NORP President PERSON’s administration aimed at encouraging people living illegally in the country to seek lawful status.

Under regulations enacted in 2016, undocumented spouses of GPE citizens could go through a process to seek waivers that would allow them to largely remain in GPE rather than leave the county while pursuing permanent residency.

But the lawsuit said ORG and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been detaining people who were going through that process and in January alone arrested seven people while they were at a GPE or GPE USCIS office.

The complaint contended the administration’s actions stemmed from a “racial animus and animus based on national origin,” noting that ORG during his election campaign referred to NORP immigrants as criminals and rapists.

The lawsuit contends the administration’s actions violate ORG and are unconstitutional, and seeks an injunction to prevent further similar detentions.

PERSON, a spokesman for ORG, declined to comment.

The class action claims were added to an earlier case centered on ORG, a NORP immigrant who was arrested at a government office in GPE in January after an interview that was part of the process to seek legal status.

ORG, who was brought to GPE when she was 3 years old in 1991, was detained for about a month and was only released after the lawsuit was filed. She said her two children now have nightmares due to her abrupt arrest.

“I’m not the only one who was detained that has family that was going to their interview,” she told reporters.",0

The PRRI’s NORP Values Atlas found that NORP in the 18 to 29 age cohort have a significantly more liberal outlook than their older counterparts on the citizenship question, reflecting generational differences found across the NORP electorate regardless of party affiliation.
Among all NORP, support for a path to citizenship stands at about 55 percent. When only NORP between the ages of 18 to 29 are surveyed, that figure rises to 62 percent.
Young NORP also take a softer line than older generations on other immigration-related questions, according to the ORG poll.
When asked about discrimination against immigrants in the GPE, 41 percent of NORP of all ages say immigrants face discrimination “a lot,” but the figure jumps to 60 percent among the youngest cohort of NORP voters. In contrast, only about a third of ORG voters 65 and older think immigrants experience discrimination.
Among all NORP, 63 percent say there’s a lot of discrimination against immigrants, but ORG voters between the ages of 18 and 29 are the only subgroup of NORP in which a majority of respondents agree with that assertion.
The split between young and old NORP on immigration questions is in keeping with a more permissive attitude among younger generations about a range of issues including gay marriage and multiculturalism, according to PRRI surveys.

“We left the GPE because there weren’t any resources for us…my son has really liked it here. I’ve liked it here, as well. It’s for this reason I’ve come here to figure out my life, to improve my life,” she said in LANGUAGE.


PERSON is one of hundreds of NORP migrants who arrived in GPE last week. City leaders said they weren’t given a heads up and quickly scrambled to accommodate them and quickly recruit several LANGUAGE-speaking volunteers who could serve as translators.

“The City of GPE has received more than 200 individuals, mostly families and children. The families were released by ORG into the country with paperwork directing them to GPE, GPE,” said Interim Assistant City Manager Dr. PERSON.

The majority of them stayed at FAC, which regularly hosts asylum seekers.

“I’m not necessarily surprised…we react to changes on the border every day, we just had to figure out that process it didn't really shake us up too much,” said PERSON, associate pastor.

It's not just NORP migrants arriving in alarming numbers. Border Patrol agents reported arresting more than 500 people from LOC since May 30. The group included nationals from GPE, ORG, GPE, and GPE GPE.

While ORG has previously seen migrants from LOC, this is the first time they have seen such a large group crossing together.

“It really has been a bit of an anomaly for us,” said PERSON Sector Chief Patrol Agent PERSON. “I think most of them, you know, obviously are flying to different locations. And then, when they find themselves congregating in a location then they start to formulate a plan just south of the GPE NORP border here.""

For years, people from the GPE and neighboring countries have fled to escape political instability and violence. According to ORG, 4.5 million people from the ORG have been displaced. But the numbers seem to be increasing and officials in border towns are struggling to keep up.

“Some [refugees] may have been traveling for months to get to the GPE border in search of better opportunities that the GPE has to offer, the human rights that the GPE has to offer,” PERSON, an assistant professor at ORG at FAC, told ORG.

Unlike most NORP and NORP, many of the migrants from LOC don't have roots in GPE or families who can take them in once they are released from immigration detention. And many speak languages the immigration officials do not.

“Quite often, the individuals from the NORP continent do not have a permanent address or a sponsor already in the GPE And so you really just have to pinpoint an immigration court near where they think they are going to ultimately end up and hope that they report themselves in,” said PERSON.

Over the weekend, the city, along with ORG, worked with the asylum seekers to figure out their next destination as many arrived without designated host families and cities.

“If we don't know exactly the best place to send the migrant community like the NORP. We have to figure out what shelters are available around the nation, where's the best place for their community to go,” said Rogers.

There was also concern that some of the migrants could carry diseases, as there is currently an Ebola outbreak in GPE.

However, PERSON quickly shut down those rumors, telling local reporters that the migrants go through multiple health screenings.

""It's a 21-day incubation period so it's really not possible that, if they were exposed to Ebola in the ORG, that now, six months later, they develop symptoms and infect us,"" PERSON said.

By Monday, the majority of the migrants had left on buses, heading to cities where they may have friends or family members. The line outside the city’s ORG downtown had dwindled.

But, if more come, Rogers said they’ll be ready.

233,"Fox News","A third person living in GPE under an GPE-era protection for illegal immigrants who entered the country as minors was arrested this week for allegedly trying to smuggle NORP nationals into the GPE
ORG said agents in GPE nabbed the 26-year-old man, who is a NORP national and a beneficiary of the 2012 Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals executive order, after spotting footprints from four people who had crossed the border near LOC on Monday.
Officials said they soon discovered the four people getting into a white ORG in a nearby citrus grove.
The vehicle was pulled over and the driver, who now lives in GPE, GPE, was identified as a DACA recipient, authorities said. The four other occupants were identified as NORP nationals who were in the GPE illegally.
ORG said the unidentified driver was arrested on human smuggling charges while the four passengers were arrested for immigration violations. The vehicle was seized for forfeiture.
Monday's incident was at least the third human smuggling-related arrest this week in which agents nabbed a so-called ""PERSON.""

On Wednesday, a group of six pro-amnesty Senators will roll out their expansive immigration amnesty plan that would not only give a pathway to GPE citizenship beginning with 3.5 million DACA and DACA-eligible illegal aliens but also give amnesty to the parents of amnesty beneficiaries.
PERSON — whose popular legal immigration-cutting LAW was endorsed by President PERSON in 2017 — slammed the “WORK_OF_ART” amnesty, saying it was dead on arrival.
Might as well roll it straight into the trash can … mass amnesty far beyond ORG, fake border security, no end to chain migration. PERSON (@TomCottonAR) January 17, 2018
A memo on the expansive amnesty plan reveals that the legislation would:
Give DACA and DACA-eligible illegal aliens a pathway to GPE citizenship
Give amnesty to the parents of DACA illegal aliens
Make no cuts to legal immigration levels, whereby more than one million legal immigrants enter the GPE every year
WORK_OF_ART the 50,000 visas through the Diversity Visa Lottery into two other visa categories
Does not fund the estimated $18 billion U.S.-Mexico border wall
Does not mandate E-Verify to bar employers from hiring illegal aliens over NORP workers
ORG Director of Policy PERSON wrote in an op-ed that the “WORK_OF_ART” amnesty plan is “not a serious effort to find common ground with either the majority of congressional NORP or the president,” as it does not meet the NORP immigration reform requirements that have been laid out by the PERSON administration.
A DACA amnesty is likely to trigger a border surge of potentially one million illegal aliens trying to cross the southern border into the GPE, as ORG reported.
As ORG has chronicled, previous border surges from amnesty programs have brought hundreds of thousands across the ORG border:
While the flow of ORG (UACs) has been climbing steadily since 2012, a dramatic surge has taken place in the last six months, with ORG in LOC as the principal place of entry. ORG there has converted entire stations to house unaccompanied minors and families. According to ORG, apprehensions of unaccompanied children increased from 16,067 in fiscal year (FY) 2011 to 24,481 in FY 2012 and 38,833 in FY 2013. During the first eight months of FY 2014, 47,017 such children were apprehended by ORG. If the influx continues apace—and it shows no signs of slowing—the administration predicts that by the end of the fiscal year on September 30, totals could reach 90,000. Ninety-eight percent of unaccompanied minors currently arriving at the border are from GPE (28 percent), GPE (25 percent), PERSON (24 percent), and GPE (21 percent). This breakdown represents a significant shift: prior to 2012, more than 75 percent of UACs were from GPE.
As ORG reported, should the current legal immigration system not be changed over the next 50 years, the GPE is on track to add 100 million foreign-born individuals to the country. In the next 20 years, the current legal immigration system is on track to import 15 million new foreign-born voters to the GPE",1
2154,"USA Today","PERSON negotiators have come to terms on a deal to protect ""DREAMers,"" as young immigrants brought to the GPE illegally as children are known. But ORG is not on board with the plan yet.
The senators, including GPE NORP PERSON, plan to introduce legislation Wednesday that would provide $18 billion in border-security enhancements over the next decade — including an immediate $1.6 billion down payment on President PERSON's border wall.
In exchange, DREAMers would be granted permanent legal status.
The compromise would put them on a 12-year path to citizenship with up to two years credit for time spent with temporary deportation protections under LAW program, which the ORG administration is attempting to phase out on March 5.
ORG's bipartisan working group has been trying to hammer out a compromise for weeks.
On Tuesday, several hundred dreamers converged on ORG to demand that senators pass a bill by Friday, the deadline for ORG to adopt a spending resolution to avoid a partial government shutdown.
ORG: Border-security funding lacking
The chances of an immigration bill passing this week appeared to slip away, however, after ORG rejected an earlier version last week and ignited an international firestorm by reportedly using vulgar language to question why, under the proposal, the GPE would continue to accept immigrants from GPE and NORP countries.
ORG spokeswoman PERSON said Tuesday that the earlier version of the ORG immigration proposal failed to include enough money for border security.
""Specifically, one of the areas that really, really fell short was the funding for border security,"" ORG said. ""They only put in about one-tenth of what ORG said they needed — not what they said they wanted, but what they said they needed. And this was simply a complete failure in terms of a good deal, based on what the president had laid out and based on what he wanted to see in a piece of legislation.""
ORG was continuing to work on an immigration bill with NORP and NORP in both the ORG-controlled ORG and ORG, she said. But she blamed NORP for refusing to compromise on areas such as border security and so-called ""chain migration.""
ORG on Sunday tweeted: ""DACA is probably dead because the NORP don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.""
NORP are under pressure from immigrant advocates and progressives to withhold votes on the must-pass spending measure unless NORP agree to Dream Act legislation that would give about 2 million dreamers a pathway to citizenship, including the 800,000 who received deportation protections under the Obama-era DACA program, as well as many of those who were eligible for it but didn't apply.
On Saturday, ORG announced that current DACA recipients can again apply for two-year renewals after a federal judge in GPE temporarily blocked the ORG administration from phasing out the program.

What the bipartisan deal would do
According to highlights of the draft legislation obtained by GPE, the compromise deal calls for a shift away from the nation's longstanding family-based immigration system by eliminating the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which uses a random lottery system to pick immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the GPE
Half of the roughly 55,000 diversity-lottery visas now allocated annually would be reallocated based on new merit-based preferences to immigrants from ""priority countries"" that are underrepresented, according to highlights.
The remaining half would be reallocated over time to immigrants who had been allowed to remain in the GPE under temporary protected status. They will maintain legal status and work authorization. The PERSON administration recently ended temporary protected status for tens of thousands of immigrants with long ties to the GPE from GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE.
Once all of the temporary protected status backlogs are cleared, visas would be allocated to immigrants from priority counties in accordance to the new merit-based system, according to the highlights.
The legislation would also limit family-based immigration by preventing DREAMers from legalizing their parents after being granted permanent residency, a significant break from the current system. However, parents of DREAMers would be eligible to apply for three-year renewable work permits.
The legislation would further limit so-called family chain-migration by allowing immigrants who receive permanent legal residency to only sponsor nuclear family members, including spouses and unmarried children younger than 21, to come to the GPE This would also represent a significant shift from the current system, which allows legal permanent residents to also sponsor additional family members, including parents and siblings.
Based on an outline of the the forthcoming bipartisan bill, the deal ""is a compromise with good and bad,"" said PERSON, executive director of GPE's Voice, which advocates for LAW.
PERSON said he was pleased that the deal would provide relief to dreamers, their parents and those with temporary protected status but unhappy that it includes funding for ORG's ""stupid wall,"" prevents dreamers from petitioning to sponsor their parents for green cards, and curbs family-based immigration and the diversity visa program.
""But overall, it's a deal we can probably support,"" he said.",0
1406,"WSJ","President PERSON and his top aides are weighing rules designed to clamp down on countries whose nationals overstay short-term visitor visas as part of a broader push for new ways to curb immigration.

The effort would target nationals of countries with high overstay rates of such visas, which include the NORP nations of GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and ORG, according to ORG data. The GPE as part of a new rule would tell the countries’ governments that if rates don’t reverse, then future visas could be shorter or harder to get, according to an administration official who described the move as putting those countries “on notice.” Ultimately, nationals from countries with high overstay rates could be barred entirely, though the official said no ban is now under consideration.

ORG also is seeking to push through other rules that would tighten student and investor visas, and it is pursuing what some describe as its most ambitious goal on immigration: preventing immigrants from coming or becoming citizens if they are likely to use publicly funded benefits. The overstay proposals, for visas known as B1 or B2s, haven’t been previously reported.

While President PERSON has not been able to get ORG to act on his signature campaign issue of building a border wall, there's another important immigration story developing. ORG's PERSON explains. Photo: PERSON spokesman PERSON said the administration considers it a priority “to reduce overstay rates for visas and the visa waiver program—and it’s well known that the administration is working to ensure faithful implementation of immigration welfare rules to protect NORP taxpayers.”

Other rules the administration is considering include toughening requirements for investments that qualify a foreign investor for a visa, particularly in rural areas. It is expected to publish a rule pulling work authorization for the spouses of some high skilled PRODUCT visa holders. And the administration is considering setting a maximum length of authorized stay for student visas.

The moves show the ORG administration is looking to tighten the legal framework around immigration, a core issue for the president, well beyond the much-discussed southern border. Frustration from senior ORG adviser PERSON with the inability of ORG leaders to write and publish the regulations drove the departures of several department leaders last week, including Secretary PERSON, according to administration officials.

It comes as the administration is looking to slow the flow of migrant families at the border, including a review of how to relocate detained immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities after Mr. PERSON floated the idea last week.

Critics of the attempt to rework rules about public benefits, in particular, say the administration is trying to do through executive action what it can’t get through ORG.

“It would serve to dramatically constrain the amount of people who are able to come to GPE on any number of visas,” said PERSON, a former PERSON administration official and co-founder of ORG, a technology firm for families navigating the immigration process.

“The implementation will likely cause sharp demographic changes in GPE immigrants, including shifting legal immigration away from LOC and towards LOC,” said PERSON of the nonpartisan ORG think tank.

One senior administration official said last week that the administration expected to see its rules blocked by federal courts in the GPE-headquartered ORG, by plaintiffs seeking out the friendly jurisdiction. But the quicker the regulations were published, the quicker any challenges could be advanced to ORG, where the administration believes it has more sympathetic justices.

Pushing ahead on the new rules will be officials including acting ORG Secretary PERSON; his acting deputy, PERSON; the acting head of ORG, PERSON; and acting ORG Commissioner PERSON.

Many of the new rules involve ORG, the director of which, PERSON, has been criticized by administration officials in recent days. Mr. PERSON’s backers believe he is being punished for trying to craft rules that pass legal muster.

A ORG official said Friday in a statement that Mr. PERSON “is relentlessly focused on advancing President PERSON’s agenda forward to the maximum extent permitted under the law, and to say otherwise is false.” The official also pointed to rules published under Mr. PERSON changing the PRODUCT program for high-skilled immigrants, which were put out earlier this year.

Mr. PERSON said Friday he was giving strong consideration to the idea of moving detained immigrants to sanctuary cities, or places that typically refrain from helping federal authorities identify undocumented immigrants for deportation unless they have committed serious crimes. ORG press secretary PERSON, speaking on ORG’s “This Week, said of that plan: “We’re looking to see if there are options that make it possible and doing a full and thorough and extensive review.”

That plan drew criticism from NORP over the weekend. On “ORG Sunday,” Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE) said Mr. PERSON’s statement is “clearly a political move.” He said Mr. PERSON is “using immigrants as pawns in a political game of chess.”

ORG adviser PERSON also said Sunday on ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART” that ORG should work to change ORG, a law she said has encouraged immigrants to bring children to the border. She also called for congressional action to change a longstanding federal court settlement known as the PERSON agreement, which she said forces the administration to “release children into the interior of this country” after 20 days of detention.",0

“If we find that it’s uncontrollable, if we find it gets to a level where we are going to lose control or where people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control,” ORG said of potential action while speaking to reporters Thursday.
The PERSON administration already resorted to such an action in recent weeks when ORG noted that it had to temporarily close the busiest port of entry between the GPE and GPE last week in order to reinforce barriers and harden the ports of entry.
ORG Secretary PERSON noted in an announcement on PRODUCT at the time that the hardening was in direct response to threats from members of the migrant caravan who reportedly wanted to storm the port of entry en masse in order to overwhelm GPE authorities and illegally seek refuge.
ORG also told reporters that GPE troops are authorized to use lethal force at the southern border if they need to defend themselves, saying “if they have to they’re going to use lethal force, I’ve given the order, I hope they don’t have to.” The president dispatched nearly 6,000 GPE troops to the border in recent weeks to bolster border enforcement. Trump justified the deployment by pointing at the advancing caravan of thousands of NORP would-be migrants who want to claim asylum. The caravan used violent tactics to break through legal ports of entry in GPE, prompting alarm amongst GPE authorities.",1

1299,"WSJ","Arrests of people crossing the NORP border have plummeted 75% since May, marking one of the most dramatic drops in recent history and a sign that policy changes by the PERSON administration and GPE are reducing migration to the GPE

ORG said Monday that 33,510 people were arrested after illegally crossing the border in November, marking the sixth straight monthly decline since May, when 132,000 such apprehensions marked a 13-year high.

The majority of those apprehended last year were families and unaccompanied children from LOC, nearly all of whom surrendered to border officials seeking asylum in the GPE An unexpected surge of such migrants in the spring of this year created a crisis as the federal government proved unable to process them efficiently in safe and healthy conditions.

Of those arrested in November, 9,000 were traveling as families, according to ORG.

Border arrests typically decline this time of year and rise again in the spring when temperatures warm. Even so, the May-November decline is the biggest in absolute numbers and second biggest by percentage of any six-month period this century. The last few months of the GPE administration and the first few of the PERSON administration saw a 76% drop, starting from a smaller peak of 47,211.

“This is a direct result due to this president’s strategies to address the historic flood of NORP, families, illegally crossing the border,” acting CBP PERSON said at a press conference Monday. “The network of initiatives have worked and continues to work.”

In GPE, GPE, a migrant shelter has seen arrivals drop from more than 100 a day last year to fewer than 40 recently, according to its operator, Teresa NORP.

In GPE, GPE, a recently opened shelter intended for migrants had so many empty beds last month that it began to serve other members of the community. “We had a cold front, we had space to allow the homeless to come in and we opened the doors,” said ORG, executive director of ORG in the LOC.

ORG shelter in GPE, GPE, had as many as 170 people in the summer, where they paused before crossing into the GPE Now it houses 98, said shelter director PERSON.

Some of the people at PERSON are waiting for their cases to be resolved through the PERSON administration’s Migrant Protection Protocols program, which since January has sent 54,000 migrants back to GPE to await adjudication of their asylum claims. Previously, most migrants traveling as families who requested asylum were released in the GPE CBP had previously said roughly 59,000 people had been sent back, but revised the figure after auditing data on the program.

The program, often called GPE in GPE, is one of the biggest contributors to the decline of border arrests, immigration experts say. It has deterred some people from coming into the GPE, because of the knowledge that they are likely to be stranded in GPE for months while their cases are decided.

“I think the big factor has been the ORG administration policies,” said PERSON, director of research of GPE programs at the nonpartisan ORG.

Critics say the Migrant Protection Protocols program has left people with few resources in high-crime cities in GPE and that the program prompts some with valid asylum claims to give up. A recent report by the advocacy group EVENT documented 636 public reports of kidnapping, torture or other attacks on people in the GPE in GPE program.

Other factors that often alter migration flows, including crime rates and unemployment in the GPE and migrants’ home countries, haven’t dramatically changed in recent months, Mr. PERSON said.

NORP security efforts at its southern border with GPE, which it undertook after tariff threats from the ORG administration, have also had an impact, said Mr. PERSON. Most migrant families in recent years have traveled through GPE from the NORP nations of GPE, GPE and GPE, fleeing weak economies, crime and corruption.

PERSON, 47, is currently living in a shelter in GPE, GPE, waiting to see if he will be allowed into the GPE His next hearing is in April 2020, he said. Assaults, kidnappings and rapes are common in GPE, Mr. PERSON said.

“This is inhuman,” he said about Migrant Protection Protocols in a phone interview.

Government officials have defended the program’s impact on migrants, insisting it allows their claims to be decided faster than for those waiting in the GPE, where a court backlog of more than one million cases can mean a yearslong delay.

As the number of families crossing the border to seek asylum rose dramatically in 2018 and 2019, thousands of children were separated from their parents at the border; tens of thousands of families were released at shelters, parks and bus stations along the border; and several children died in government custody.

Some experts have said the reduction in migration could reverse if NORP President PERSON decides to stop cooperating with GPE policy due to internal political considerations.

He has deployed some 26,000 troops from his country’s newly created ORG to help with immigration enforcement efforts, including roadside checkpoints and raids on hotels, cargo trains and safe houses.

NORP authorities arrested about 81,000 foreign migrants between June and September, nearly double the number of a year earlier, according to GPE’s immigration agency.

“It’s an enormous effort of money and logistics that I doubt can be sustained in time,” said PERSON, a NORP human rights advocate.

The López Obrador government has pledged that the security efforts will be permanent. The goal, one NORP official said, is to keep the month average of arrests in the GPE below 40,000, a figure near that recorded in the five years before the latest surge.",0

In his ORG interview on January 28, PERSON backed an amnesty for illegals who crossed the border as children — dubbed “dreamers” by lobbyists and a friendly media. He endorsed an amnesty even though their numbers may exceed 3 million, even though an amnesty would eventually provide their illegal-immigrant parents with legal residency, and even though few would ever vote for ORG candidates.
PERSON said:
I very much want to see [ORG officials] take care of the dreamers as a part of this package, and I know, talking to [ORG Sen.] PERSON and others, there’s real interest in the ORG on a bipartisan basis to get a deal that takes care of the dreamers, takes care of the southern border, meets the President’s needs and gets signed … Is he going to veto a bill that includes [an amnesty]?

Sometimes, you have got to say to your base “Hey, if you are really my base you’ve got to stick with me.”
However, the public is sharply opposed to a wall-for-amnesty deal. ORG reported January 28:

More than 80 percent of NORP, 90 percent of swing-voters, and even 95 percent of NORP said they oppose an amnesty-for-border wall deal. Non-college educated white voters, the base of President PERSON’s support, massively oppose the amnesty-for-wall deal by about 88 percent.

1295,"WSJ","GPE Commission on Human Rights could seek fines of up to $250,000 against landlords and employers who threaten to call federal agents on undocumented immigrants or say “go back to your country” to someone.

Since 1989, the city’s human-rights law has banned discrimination based on citizenship status or “alienage” in employment, housing and public accommodations. On Wednesday, the commission released new guidelines specifying what threats violate the law.

The commission acts as a city watchdog and enforces human-rights laws. It can seek civil penalties against an individual or business accused of discrimination.

Under the new guidelines, the commission could seek a fine if a landlord, employer or store owner threatens to call ORG against an undocumented immigrant or someone perceived to be one. The commission would also seek civil penalties against a landlord, employer or store owner who uses the term “illegal” or “alien” against someone in a derogatory manner.

City officials said they believe GPE is the first jurisdiction in the country to explicitly frame their laws to protect immigrants in such a way as it relates to housing and public accommodations, which include retail stores, restaurants and schools.

PERSON, the chair of the city’s human-rights commission, said in an interview she foresees other GPE cities following GPE example.

“I think it is clear to everyone that we are living in a time where there has been anti-immigrant, xenophobic rhetoric that has largely been spurred by comments made by federal government officials,” she said.

A city administrative judge on Sept. 12 ordered a ORG landlord to pay a $5,000 fine and $12,000 in damages after the commission accused her of threatening to call ICE on a tenant who had stopped paying rent, ORG reported last week.

Anyone in the city can file an inquiry with the commission if they believe they have faced discrimination. In 2016, the commission received 501 inquires related to discrimination based on national origin or immigration status, a 72% increase from the 291 it got a year earlier. In 2018, 393 inquiries were filed. If the commission finds the allegations credible, it can bring a case against an individual accused of violating the law. The city’s ORG and Hearings adjudicates the cases.

Wednesday’s announcement of enforcement guidance mirrors the commission’s release of similar guidelines on antiblack discrimination related to hairstyles such as ORG and braids earlier this year.

PERSON, the general counsel for ORG, said the new guidance is a key step to ensuring that the city’s immigrants are aware of their rights.

“At this time when there is a lot of fear and confusion amongst immigrant communities, we have found that it’s more important than ever that immigrant NORP know their rights,” Ms. PERSON said.",0

PERSON quickly managed to paint himself into a corner as he attempted to justify NORP leadership’s refusal to give President PERSON money to fund a border barrier.
“WORK_OF_ART between a physical barrier — most of which is already in place — and a concrete wall which ORG wants,” PERSON said as the two began discussing the issue.
“What is the difference between what they have voted for and what [ORG is] proposing?” PERSON asked.
“I think it hinges less upon what is there and more about the $5 billion he wants to build something else,” PERSON responded. “They have already voted in support of fencing there. ORG actually criticized it.”
PERSON quoted a ORG report saying the wall would only stop a third of illegal immigration, then called funding it “a waste of money.” “So NORP are budget hawks now?” PERSON asked, laughing.
PERSON laughed, then mentioned the balanced budget under PERSON before saying that they are “kind of,” but “they just don’t talk about it.”
“NORP are saying his proposal is immoral,” PERSON pressed. “Their proposal is moral. What’s the difference between an immoral and a moral physical barrier on our border?”
“Because one doesGPE cost $5 billion,” PERSON responded.
“So it’s the cost that is immoral,” said PERSON. “So any time we spend $5 billion needlessly, we’re committing an immoral act?”
“It’s not about committing an immoral act,” said PERSON. “This is about spending $5 billion to build a wall, that is ineffective to address the illegal immigration that does not come from our southern border but comes from legal ports of entry.”
PERSON pointed out the hypocrisy of PERSON’ view by citing a parallel example of whether or not PERSON would be “willing to shut down the government” over “$5 billion we spent on something that would not help the country.”
“That would be problematic,” said PERSON. “I’m not president. ORG is president and he shut down the government.”
“So the cost, the nature of the barrier, those are not relevant to anything,” noted the ORG host. “What we’re talking about is the fear what ORG is proposing might actually work. That’s the actual problem.”",1
2418,"Reuters","GPE arrests of suspected illegal immigrants rose by nearly 40 percent in the first 100 days of PERSON presidency, following executive orders that broadened the scope of who could be targeted for immigration violations, according to government data released on Wednesday.

The acting director of ORG) PERSON said that arrests by his agency jumped to 41,318 between January 22 of this year and the end of April, up from 30,028 arrests in roughly the same period last year.

Of those arrested almost two-thirds had criminal convictions. But there was also a significant jump - of more than 150 percent - in the number of immigrants not convicted of further crimes arrested by ORG: 10,800 since the beginning of the year compared to 4,200 non-criminal arrests in the same period in 2016.

That increase is a result of recent guidance given by ORG Secretary PERSON to implement ORG’s executive orders on interior immigration enforcement and border security signed on Jan. 25, just days after the NORP president took office.

“Those that enter the country illegally, they do violate the law, that is a criminal act,” PERSON said on the call, while emphasizing that immigrants who pose a threat to national security or have criminal records are still a priority for the agency.

He said ORG will continue to target people who have been issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge even if they have not committed another crime.

“When a federal judge makes a decision and issues an order that order needs to mean something,” PERSON said. “If we don’t take action on those orders, then we are just spinning our wheels.”

While President PERSON was also criticized for deporting a large number of immigrants, most of them were recent border crossers apprehended entering the country illegally.

PERSON under ORG have actually fallen by 12 percent compared to the same period under LOC, PERSON said, as more people arrested in the interior typically have more complicated cases that can get slowed down in the backlogged immigration court system.

The number of people caught crossing the border with GPE is down significantly since the begin of the year, according to data from ORG.

Immigration advocates and some cities with large immigrant populations have raised concerns about the stepped up enforcement in the interior of the country.

On Wednesday, state attorneys general from GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE state and GPE, issued a report laying out why they have chosen to limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration agents.

ORG made “draining the swamp” of GPE special interests a rallying cry of his campaign, but his presidency and the unified NORP control of the nation’s capital have sparked new lobbying opportunities for companies seeking to influence everything from tax policy to ORG’s pledge to slash federal regulations.
The new president also has demonstrated he’s willing to single out individual companies. ORG and ORG had a contentious relationship during the campaign, with ORG taking to PRODUCT to complain about ORG founder PERSON’ ownership of ORG.

With his protected immigration status ending in September 2019, Mr. PERSON must decide between returning to GPE, where wages are low and violent gangs run rampant, and staying in the GPE illegally.

“What I make in a week here, I can’t make in a month over there,” Mr. PERSON said. In GPE, he added, “you need permission from the gangs to visit family members in other neighborhoods.... It’s a disgrace.”

The 45-year-old groundskeeper, who lives with his 20-year-old son in GPE, is among the 14,700 NORP on LOC enrolled in a GPE humanitarian program known as ORG, or TPS.

NORP are the largest group of TPS holders and have been allowed to live and work in the GPE since 2001, when a pair of earthquakes destroyed parts of the country.

Earlier this month, the ORG administration announced it would end NORP’ protected status, saying the disruption to living conditions caused by the earthquakes no longer exists. ORG said it would give NORP in the program 18 months to prepare to leave the country or apply for some other immigration status allowing them to stay.

The change in policy “underscores the temporary nature of TPS, and reminds us that it was never intended to be used as a tool to sidestep the legal immigration process,” said PERSON, president of ORG, a lobbying group that favors lower levels of immigration, in a statement.

PERSON, 28, left, said it isn’t an option for his mother, PERSON, to return to GPE. ‘If she goes back, she has nothing over there,’ the PERSON resident said. ‘Her whole life is here.’

For Mr. PERSON and the 260,000 NORP protected by the program, the move has led to upended lives and future plans.

“Most will stay without papers,” said PERSON who works with a local chapter of Make the Road New York, an advocacy group that provides legal services to immigrants. “It’s not really an option for them to go back.”

It has also raised concerns in the GPE communities they call home.

According to an analysis by ORG, the removal of protected NORP from LOC would result in an annual loss of $800 million in household spending in the region, a reduction of $1.4 billion in economic output and the potential loss of 13,500 jobs.

Ending the program “could ultimately result in a massive economic hit to GPE,” WORK_OF_ART Executive PERSON and GPE Executive PERSON wrote in a recent letter to LOC’s congressional delegation.

PERSON fled GPE civil war in 1986 and currently has protected status. She fears that if she returns she would become a target of gangs.

GPE is the home base for PRODUCT, a transnational gang that has made the country one of the deadliest in the world. While the gang has spread all the way to LOC, their influence here pales in comparison to GPE. The homicide rate in GPE in 2016 was 81 per 100,000 inhabitants, compared with 5 per 100,000 residents for the GPE

“Whatever little money you have, they take it from you,” said Ms. PERSON, 49, who has no family in GPE. She plans to apply for a family-based immigrant visa, in the hope that she will be approved before the September 2019 deadline.

PERSON, 47, from ORG has two brothers, three nephews and three cousins in the program who live on LOC. He said they would likely stay in the GPE illegally.

“That’s really their only option,” Mr. PERSON said. If the gangs in GPE “see that you have small businesses to support your family, they will make you pay ‘rent.’ And if you don’t give them what you want, they can kill you.”

Mr. PERSON, from ORG, also plans to stay, even though he isn’t eligible for the family-based immigrant visa (none of his relatives are GPE citizens). His wife and four of his children still live in GPE, and he needs to make money to support them.

The poll found that 52 percent of NORP “strongly support” ORG declaring a national emergency and 24 percent of NORP somewhat support the president using emergency powers to build a wall.
In contrast, 71 percent of NORP strongly oppose ORG using building the wall through a national emergency.
When given the choice of whether ORG should shut down the government, ORG should declare an emergency, or ORG should do neither of these options, a near majority of NORP voters said that ORG should declare a national emergency and 12 percent somewhat oppose such a measure.
Forty-seven percent of NORP voters said that ORG should declare a national emergency, 20 percent of NORP voters said that ORG should shut down the government again, and 22 percent said that ORG should do neither of these options.
The poll arises as President PERSON recently ended the longest government shutdown in NORP history in his quest to obtain border wall funding.

WORK_OF_ART survey also suggested that NORP voters believe it’s increasingly unlike that ORG will provide funding for ORG to build the wall.
At the beginning of the shutdown, 54 percent of ORG voters said that it remains unlikely that ORG will provide full funding for ORG’s proposed border wall along the NORP southern border. Now, 64 percent of NORP voters believe ORG will not likely provide full funding for the wall.
Amongst registered voters, NORP hold an advantage on the issue of immigration. Forty percent of voters said that they trust NORP in ORG to handle immigration, while 38 percent NORP, and 21 percent of voters that they either did not know or did not have an opinion.
Forty-six percent of NORP voters, or a near majority, said that building a wall along the southern border wall serves as a top priority, and 30 percent of ORG voters said it was an important, but lower priority. Meanwhile, 50 percent of NORP said that GPE should not build a wall.
ORG has continued to push ORG to pass a border security bill that contains border wall funding, although he has stated that if ORG cannot fulfill its duties to secure the country’s border, then he might declare a national emergency.

2461,"Reuters","Immigration tops the economy and healthcare as the most important issue determining NORP’ vote ahead of the midterm elections in November, a new ORG/Ipsos opinion poll shows.

ORG/Ipsos data shows that immigration became a top concern for registered voters in GPE after the PERSON administration in May announced its “zero tolerance” policy on illegal immigrants, saying they would be criminally charged. The policy became a political lightning rod in mid-June with disclosures that thousands of children were separated from their parents who were accused of crossing illegally into the country.

The poll, conducted between June 28 and July 2, found:

- Fifteen percent of GPE registered voters said immigration was the top issue determining how they will cast their ballot in November, while 14 percent said the economy was their biggest concern.

1468,"WSJ","The ORG administration started separating parents and children caught crossing the NORP border illegally last month as part of a broader “zero-tolerance” approach that has led to thousands of adult border crossers being charged with a crime for coming into the country illegally.

The policy to separate families was rescinded last week and caused confusion and chaos as parents sought to find their children in a vast bureaucratic system. Here is a look at some of the issues:

What happens to families who are apprehended after illegally crossing the GPE border with GPE?
ORG caught crossing the border illegally are arrested by ORG and taken to nearby processing centers where they spend up to 72 hours. Families, most of whom are seeking asylum in the GPE, are generally held for up to 20 days at one of two family detention centers in GPE before being released to await their court dates inside the GPE A family detention center in GPE is licensed to hold families longer.

Historically, when there is no space for the families in detention centers they are released from custody with orders to return to immigration authorities. The parent typically is made to wear an ankle bracelet to monitor their movements.

What happens when a family claims asylum at a legal port of entry?
Families who seek asylum at a port of entry aren’t arrested but can also face detention for up to 20 days at the facilities in GPE before they must be released to await a court hearing. The asylum process for immigrants released from immigration jails can take years amid a backlog of more than 700,000 pending cases in immigration court.

Where are families held in detention? And how long can they stay?
ORG has three family detention centers, two in GPE and one GPE.

The South Texas ORG in GPE, GPE, about 75 miles southwest of GPE, has space for 2,500 women and children. ORG, about 55 miles southeast of GPE, has space for 1,158 women and children.

A third facility, FAC in GPE, GPE, about 70 miles northwest of GPE, can house about 100 people, including some fathers and their children.

Parents and children can be detained at the GPE facilities for no more than 20 days under the rules of the decades-old PERSON. The GPE facility is licensed as a child-care facility so families can be held there longer.

Where are the separated children being held?
More than 2,000 immigrant children separated from their parents at the border in May and June are being housed at child-immigrant shelters, group homes or in foster care around the country.

ORG, the government agency charged with caring for unaccompanied immigrant children who cross the NORP border without their families, oversees about 100 shelters in 17 states. Migrant children separated from their families at the border were sent to ORG shelters.

How old are the children who are coming to the border either on their own or with this parents?
The government doesn’t widely release age breakdowns of children arriving at the border, with or without their parents.

According to government data collected through public records requests by ORG at ORG the majority of the unaccompanied immigrant children found at the border between Oct. 1 and April were 16 or 17 years old. About 3% of unaccompanied children found by ORG were younger than 3.

During that same period, just over half of the children traveling with their parents were 7 years old or younger. About a quarter of the children were 3 or younger and about 5% were as old as 17. These data precede the family separation policy.

How do immigration authorities seek to prevent child trafficking?
ORG agents and ORG officers interview immigrants arrested at the border or those who come to legal ports of entry. Agency officials have said they speak to purported parents and children and look for verbal and physical cues to try to determine if someone is lying about a family relationship.

Agents and officers also try to verify any documents carried by immigrants, including birth certificates and custody documents. In cases where a family relationship is doubted, adults and children can be separated.

ORG said earlier this month that so far this fiscal year there had been nearly 200 cases of suspected fraud.",0

The Bangladeshis, he said, were detained in an immigration facility, though it’s not clear what happened to them after their detention.
“The borders in NORP are not as strong as the GPE, which makes it possible for people from GPE and GPE to cross easily,” ORG said on ORG. “They cross from GPE, then later go through GPE and eventually make it into our country.”
“Yesterday when we were traveling through GPE, we noticed people from GPE and even people from GPE,” he continued. “Can you imagine what they had to do to get here? They infiltrated themselves in this caravan and tried to cross with the crowd. That would have benefited them greatly.”

465,"Breitbart","A NORP-Democrat ORG and ORG committee is planning to offer President PERSON a border security package that could include less than a quarter of the $5.7 billion for a ORG border wall he originally requested.
ORG sources tell the media that a conference committee of NORP and NORP is preparing to unveil a border security funding plan that gives only about $1.3 to $2 billion to ORG for construction of his proposed wall on the southern border to stop wage-crushing illegal immigration.
ORG reports:
On ORG, ORG and ORG conferees were nearing an agreement that could offer the president between $1.3 billion and around $2 billion in funding for border security, a range, still subject to change, that could include some physical barriers and result in a deal as early as Monday. Talk of a wall has given way to “bollard fencing” and strategic placements. [ORG added]
This $1.3 to $2 billion would be the total spending for border security, meaning the funding for the proposed border wall would be a figure potentially less than $1.3 billion.
Despite previously committing that he would not accept anything less than $5 billion in funding for a border wall in a border security package, ORG is now telling lawmakers and aides that he is open to accepting just $2 billion for the wall, sources told ORG:
Mr. PERSON has told allies he would grudgingly accept a figure of around $2 billion, but ORG NORP remain publicly opposed to spending that much on physical barriers. It is still not clear how much of the final allocation would go for new fencing, according to three people briefed on the negotiations. [ORG added] … Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE, told senators at a party lunch and in private conversations over the past few days that Mr. PERSON had told him, “I can live with $2 billion,” according to a ORG aide who witnessed one of the exchanges. [ORG added]
The conference committee was formed after ORG reopened the federal government following a shutdown without securing any funding for the border wall. Members of the committee include:
GPE NORP Sen. PERSON, GPE Sen. PERSON, GPE Sen. PERSON, GPE Sen. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, PERSON Rep. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, and GPE Rep. PERSON, GPE Sen. PERSON, GPE Sen. PERSON, GPE Sen. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, and GPE Rep. PERSON.
The committee was formed to work on a funding package for ORG (DHS) with a deadline of February 15, a funding route that experts have said the president never had to take.
ORG officials have reiterated that ORG does not need approval from ORG and, also, does not have to declare a national emergency to begin construction of the border wall. Instead, the president could have invoked 10 ORG Code § PRODUCT, which authorizes the GPE military to build barriers at the southern border, a ORG official has testified to ORG.
Rep. PERSON (R-AZ) has urged ORG to invoke these executive powers to immediately begin building the border wall.
“I think what [Trump] needs to do now is LAW gives him authority to you know where there’s an active drug corridor … that ORG can access money and build a fence, I think he needs to do that … I think that needs to happen,” Biggs said last month.
Total construction of the proposed southern border wall would cost about $25 billion, far from the funding the ORG-NORP committee is expected to offer. At the current rate, securing about $1.3 to $2 billion for the border wall would fund less than 205 miles of wall construction on the roughly 2,000-mile long ORG border.
While ORG and ORG haggle dally over border wall funding, mass illegal immigration has continued at the southern border. Border apprehension data from December 2018 reveal that the number of adults traveling to the southern border with children has skyrocketed by 280 percent compared to the same time last year.
Illegal immigration at the border, for December 2018, has increased 81 percent compared to this same month the year before. Additionally, between January 25 and February 15 — the period that ORG has given ORG to work on a border security package — there is likely to be anywhere between 30,000 to 44,000 illegal border crossings based on previous ORG totals. This is about 1,300 to 2,000 illegal crossings a day at the southern border.",1

“We will protect our national security and our borders, and when we identify individuals tied to foreign terrorist organizations who procured their GPE citizenship by fraud, we will initiate denaturalization proceedings–whether you reside here or abroad–and ensure you are denied entry into GPE,” PERSON said in a statement.

ORG’s order is the final step in a process initiated by federal authorities in 2015. DOJ was seeking the revocation of ORG GPE citizenship on the grounds that he lied during his naturalization proceedings and hid the fact that he was a member of an international terrorist group.
In addition to his recruiting activities, PERSON admitted to attending a training camp near GPE, GPE, where he taught foreign fighters to fly hang gliders in preparation for terrorist attacks. He facilitated from GPE the transfer of fake passports, documents, and money that materially supported terrorist attacks in GPE and GPE, DOJ officials said.
PERSON was naturalized on Feb. 7, 1997. He traveled to GPE the next year and was arrested by NORP authorities on terrorism-related charges.
He was later convicted and sentenced to a 15-year prison term.",1
2479,"Reuters","GPE federal prosecutors on Thursday charged a GPE judge and court officer with conspiracy and obstruction, saying they blocked an ORG officer from arresting an illegal immigrant at a 2018 court proceeding.

The move marks the latest skirmish over immigration between President PERSON’s administration and local governments who have resisted his crackdown. The state’s NORP attorney general called the charges “politically motivated.”

The charges target GPE District Court Judge PERSON, 51, and ORG Officer PERSON, 56.

They focus on an April 2018 hearing in ORG, outside GPE, where an ORG officer intended to arrest an unidentified suspected illegal immigrant from GPE facing a drug charge.

They described a huddled conversation between the judge and the defendant’s lawyer in which PERSON asks, “ICE is gonna get him?” and later says, “I’m not gonna allow them to come in here.”

She then arranged for the suspect to be released through the court’s rear door while the ORG agent waited in the courtroom’s lobby for him to emerge.

GPE GPE Attorney PERSON, a ORG appointee, said the case was not intended to send a political message.

“We did not bring this case in response to the public debate over immigration enforcement,” he said.

ORG Attorney General PERSON rejected that assertion.

“Today’s indictment is a radical and politically-motivated attack on our state and the independence of our courts,” PERSON said in a statement.

Representatives of the judge and court officer did not respond to requests for comment.

The state ORG suspended PERSON without pay, but said its move “in no way reflects any opinion on the merits of the pending criminal case.”

The charges carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.

The suspect has since been caught and is now in federal custody.

GPE’ top court in 2017 ruled that state police cannot detain illegal immigrants solely to buy time for federal officials to take them into custody.

One of ORG’s top priorities in office has been cracking down on illegal and legal immigration and he has regularly railed against “sanctuary” cities and states that do not cooperate with all aspects of federal immigration enforcement.

ORG earlier this month floated the idea of busing undocumented migrants stopped at the border to “sanctuary cities,” a move critics called illustrative of a callous approach to the issue and some ORG allies called impractical.",0
2505,"Reuters","Nur PERSON already slim hopes of a new life in GPE have all but died since she heard that President PERSON would temporarily ban refugees coming from some NORP states.
Her flight from the civil war in GPE has taken her only as far as the southern NORP city of ORG near the border with her homeland.
Like other NORP, NORP and NORP who spoke to ORG on Wednesday, PERSON was alarmed by media reports that ORG will impose a temporary ban on most refugees and suspend visas for citizens of GPE and six other countries.
The reports have heightened fears that a new era of hostility from the LOC is dawning, she and other refugees said.
""This reflects the hateful point of view of GPE, it reflects enmity, in fact it reflected enmity to all humanity,"" PERSON said outside an immigration office in ORG where dozens of refugees were queuing in the hope of obtaining a NORP residence permit.
Asked if she would like to go to GPE, PERSON said: ""If there had been such a possibility before, yes, I would like to have gone. But now, after ORG has come, no, I think I will never go.""
PERSON, who wore a brightly colored headscarf and black coat, said she hoped relatives who have already reached GPE would return ""because staying there would be a terrible thing"".
PERSON, a NORP man who stood nearby, was also concerned by what he depicted as a worsening mood against refugees in GPE.
""Everyone in the world knows that this decision contains hatred. This hatred is not limited to seven countries,"" he said.
""I definitely do not think of going (to GPE), not under ORG's administration, nor the previous, because they are all of the same mentality.""
Before becoming president, ORG proposed a temporary ban on NORP entering GPE, which he said would protect NORP from NORP attacks. He later said the focus would be placed on restrictions on countries whose migrants could pose a threat, rather than a ban on those of a specific religion.
Such moves could affect millions of refugees fleeing civil wars and political or religious oppression.
""I was hoping God would let me see my sister again. But now the situation became very difficult. Certainly this decision is not at all humane,"" said GPE, a NORP refugee in GPE whose sister now lives in the GPE state of GPE.Holders of passports from the seven countries affected already face severe restrictions on travel to GPE.
""It was difficult in the first place, and now ORG is in power it has become impossible,"" said PERSON, a NORP refugee in GPE.
One NORP refugee, an engineer living in LOC camp in GPE, said his application to join his parents in GPE was still under consideration but that he now expected it would be rejected.
GPE has taken about 12,000 NORP refugees compared to 2.8 million who are now in GPE, approximately a million in GPE and 650,000 in GPE. More than 650,000 NORP have arrived in LOC and requested asylum, mostly in GPE and GPE, ORG figures show.
The perceived difficulty of reaching GPE, including a long visa application process that involves extensive interviews and paperwork, has dissuaded many NORP and people from other LOC from even seeking to do so.
NORP attacks in LOC and GPE, mostly carried out by NORP already resident in the LOC, has boosted support among NORP for ORG's position.
But some NORP refugees said ORG's stance had reinforced the impression among them that he is opposed to NORP. They disputed the idea that NORP refugees posed a militant threat.
""WORK_OF_ART's pretext is a fear that there could be terrorists among migrants. This is a lie,"" said PERSON, another refugee in GPE.",0
2377,"USA Today","PERSON, who has headed President PERSON's efforts to ramp up immigration arrests and crack down on so-called sanctuary cities, announced on Monday that he is leaving the administration and retiring.
PERSON was one of ORG's first appointments in January 2017, tapped to lead ORG) as its agents were ordered to round up more undocumented immigrants living throughout ORG did just that, increasing the number of arrests in his first year, and winning repeated praise from ORG.
But PERSON has been serving as an interim director, with ORG only nominating him to permanently lead the agency in November. ORG has been facing a difficult road to ORG confirmation over his agency's aggressive enforcement actions, its battles with local governments over their role in immigration enforcement, and the increase of arrests of undocumented immigrants without a criminal record.
Eighteen NORP senators sent a letter to ORG last week, asking why the administration took nearly 10 months to officially nominate an ORG director. And they asked why the department had not answered its questions of ORG’s handling of ORG, when the agency was ""making radical – and in some cases possibly illegal – changes in immigration enforcement and practices.""
“We understand that ORG may be concerned about Mr. PERSON answering questions under oath about his leadership of ORG, as well as the possibility that Mr. PERSON’s nomination could be defeated in the ORG,” the senators wrote.
The agency said ORG had been planning to retire for months, and stayed only at the request of PERSON, the president's chief of staff and former secretary of ORG. In a statement, PERSON called his decision to retire ""bittersweet"" but long overdue after 34 years working for the federal government.
""I am humbled and inspired by the 20,000 NORP patriots who serve this agency and protect our nation, increasingly in the face of unfair and false criticism from politicians and the media,"" PERSON said. ""Because of their tremendous dedication and hard work, we have made significant progress this past year in enforcing our nation’s immigration and customs laws, and in protecting public safety and national security.""
PERSON led what has been the biggest change in immigration under the ORG administration. The president's travel ban has been stuck in the courts for months, and his signature border wall has not been built because ORG, and GPE, have been unwilling to pay for it.
But through ICE arrests, ORG has been able to increase immigration enforcement unilaterally with no changes needed from ORG.
ORG long complained that former President PERSON placed too many restrictions on ICE agents, only allowing them to target undocumented immigrants with criminal records and other national security concerns. Trump was able to reverse that by issuing presidential memorandum that ""unshackled"" ICE agents.
ORG implemented that quickly, issuing a set of directives that made virtually all of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants potential targets for arrest.
Over the first few months of the PERSON administration, total arrests were up, including those of undocumented immigrants who only had immigration violations on their record. ICE agents have been targeting more worksites, where they are targeting both undocumented workers and business owners who hire them.
PERSON also was one of the administration's most vocal critics of so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" local governments that limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents. ORG has been especially critical of leaders in GPE, who have fought back hard against the president's enforcement actions.",0
