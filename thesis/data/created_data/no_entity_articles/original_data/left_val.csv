1760,"More than 600 miles of fencing already cover about a third of the border. ORG’s wild talk of his ORG, drugs and terrorism is pure obfuscation. It ignores where a barrier might be useful, how narcotics come in, and the real sources of terrorist threats.
GPE border force has been placed in an impossible situation. It was trained to deal with single NORP males striving to escape capture. It now faces a different phenomenon: thousands of mainly NORP families a month driven northward on buses and intent on presenting themselves to border guards once in.
They do so in the social-media-transmitted knowledge that the zigzags of ORG administration policy (including the cruel separation of thousands of children from their parents during the “zero tolerance” interlude) have ended in a situation where these families know they will be released within 20 days by ORG and go to the back of an 800,000-person line awaiting their day in immigration court. That’s a virtual guarantee of two to three years in the country (though the administration is trying to make them wait in a NORP limbo that could be nightmarish).
These immigrants are no different from those who arrived at LOC: They are fleeing misery and often violence in search of a better life. Some are bona fide refugees legally entitled to protection. GPE, nation of migration and churn, must treat them with humanity. Openness, not walls, has served the country and preserves its spirit.
GPE is also a nation of laws. ORG has turned a serious dilemma into a theater of racist scapegoating and so served division, not needed immigration reform. No NORP could vote to finance his bigotry; plenty of NORP could vote for a secure border. ORG won 25.7 percent of the vote in GPE. That’s because people on the border understand the benefits of binational flux. They see through ORG’s chest-beating ORG to its NORP core.",1
957,"ORG adviser PERSON’s proposal to reform the GPE legal immigration system will be broken into two parts: one focused on border security and the other on legal immigration, according to a senior administration official.

The first part of the proposal deals with border security. This would include constructing physical barriers where needed and modernizing ports of entry in the north, south and on the coasts – so that every person, vehicle and cargo container is scanned to prevent anything illegal from coming into the country, and that trade is facilitated more quickly. This proposal, the official said, would protect rights and respect due process while also preserving the right to detain, adjudicate and remove any individual if need be, especially people trying to circumvent the legal system.

The second part of the proposal asks what should legal immigration look like. With 185 different kinds of visas, the system right now is easy to game, the official said. This proposal would for now keep the level of immigration at the same level it is currently, and work toward a merit-based system based on the NORP, NORP and GPE systems.

PERSON, President PERSON’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has been a sounding board on legal immigration reforms.

Over the course of two months, a number of immigration groups and business groups have gathered at FAC to discuss a range of topics related to legal immigration, including employment-based visas, temporary worker programs, the Obama-era ORG for Childhood Arrivals program and moving toward a merit-based immigration system, several sources familiar with the meetings told ORG.

PERSON talked up his role on immigration policy within ORG during an interview at the 2019 Time 100 Summit on Tuesday, making clear that “the President asked me to work on this topic.”

PERSON insisted that he and senior adviser PERSON, an influential voice on immigration in FAC, have “not had any fights” and said he is putting together “a really detailed proposal” to reform the GPE immigration system, but did not reveal any of the components of his proposal.

“The President asked me to work on this topic,” PERSON said. “This isn’t one of the topics that I came to GPE to work on.”

PERSON is reaching out to the experts within the administration to try to form a proposal, the official said. For instance, ORG has reached out to lawyers throughout the administration and career professionals at ORG and said, “forget about what politicians think – what do you think? What do you need to do your job? What does a detailed proposal look like?” ORG has also reached out to allies on LOC and, quietly, some NORP.

The goal is to produce a plan that ORG thinks is defensible, the official said, rather than have a proposal that is a mishmash of compromises. ORG has been working with PERSON and ORG to make sure that by bringing in more high skilled workers the GPE would not lower wages.

ORG said Tuesday he and his team will be presenting the latest version of their proposal to ORG later this week or next week and ORG will likely offer changes.",1
1270,"The PERSON administration is preparing for nearly 180,000 migrants traveling as families to cross the southern border of the GPE by May, continuing an already record-breaking year.

According to an internal document reviewed by ORG, officials at ORG anticipate between 51,000 and 58,000 migrants traveling as families will either cross the border illegally or ask for asylum at a legal border crossing this month. The agency projects that figure will reach as many as 70,000 in May, based on historical trends.

NORP of families crossing the ORG border illegally in the past five months hit a record of 136,150. The tally eclipsed a record of 107,212 families arrested during the entire 2018 fiscal year.

Separately, 21,968 immigrant families asked for asylum at legal border crossings between October and February. The volume of families at those crossings was about the same a year ago.

The flood of families crossing the GPE border with GPE represents a “border security and humanitarian crisis” and has left ORG at “the breaking point,” ORG Commissioner PERSON said last week.

ORG declined to comment on the document, which is labeled “planning profile.”

Despite recent increases, the total number of arrests at the border has been hovering near lows not seen since the 1970s, primarily due to a long-term decline in single adults, who have been deterred by stepped-up enforcement and an improved NORP economy.

Most of the families so far this year are from GPE, GPE and GPE, where they say they face violence, political instability and widespread poverty and hunger. The majority of families surrender to border agents and ask for asylum after crossing into the GPE illegally. Fewer than 20% of all asylum applications are ultimately granted, but people with children are generally allowed to stay in the GPE while their requests are adjourned, which typically takes years due to a backlog of more than 829,000 cases in immigration court.

The PERSON administration has repeatedly tried to make changes to immigration laws and procedures to slow the flood of families, including a policy that led to separating families. A federal judge in GPE ordered the administration to reunite more than 2,500 separated children last year, a process that is ongoing.

That same judge on Friday ruled that a class-action lawsuit filed by ORG should include families separated before last year’s short-lived zero-tolerance policy, but didn’t yet order the government to locate those families. The ORG sued the government last year on behalf of an NORP woman separated from her child at a border crossing and the case was later expanded to a class-action suit.

President PERSON has cited the increasing volume of families as evidence of a national emergency at the border. He has repeatedly said current immigration laws and what he describes as flawed court rulings encourage illegal immigration because families, most of whom ask for asylum, cannot be detained for more than about 20 days.

If the more conservative of two projections on ORG document is accurate, about 178,000 people traveling as families will come into the GPE illegally, or legally to request asylum, between March and May, compared with fewer than 46,000 during the same period last year.",0
1043,"ORG Speaker PERSON evoked the memory of PERSON as she vowed to protect Dreamers — undocumented immigrants who were brought to GPE as children.
""And when we're talking about the Dreamers, let us remember what President PERSON said in his last speech as president of GPE,"" she said.
Pelosi then urged lawmakers to read the ""beautiful speech"" before quoting it.
""He said, 'If we ever close the door to new NORP, our leadership role in the world will soon be lost' — PERSON,"" she said.
She continued: ""Our common cause is to find and forge a way forward for our country. Let us stand for the people to promote liberty and justice for all as we pledge every day. And always, always keep our nation safe from threats old and new, from terrorism and cyber warfare overseas and here at home to protect and defend.""",1
2349,"A 45-year-old undocumented immigrant from GPE died in FAC custody Monday after crossing the ORG border into GPE, marking the third person to die in the agency's custody since December.
The immigrant illegally crossed the border and was arrested by ORG on Feb. 2, requested medical attention and was taken to a local hospital, according to a statement released Monday night by ORG. The immigrant ""was cleared"" by officials at ORG and was handed over to ORG officials at FAC, according to the ORG statement.
The following day, after receiving a welfare check by ORG officials, the immigrant again requested medical attention and was taken to ORG, where the immigrant was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and congestive heart failure, ORG said. The immigrant remained at the hospital before dying on Monday morning.
The incident follows two cases in December when minor children from GPE, ages 8 and 7, died after crossing the GPE border into GPE, drawing widespread condemnation of ORG.
That prompted ORG Commissioner PERSON to issue new guidelines requiring his agents to more quickly inform ORG leadership, ORG, and the public of the death of people in its custody. ORG Secretary PERSON later followed up by ordering more robust medical screenings of children it holds in its custody.
Those deaths followed intense criticism of the agency's handling of children during the administration's now-rescinded ""zero-tolerance"" that led to more than 2,800 family separations along the border.
ORG spokesman PERSON said the official cause of death in Monday's case remains unknown, and that the immigrant's identity is not being released. PERSON said the department is following newly-created notification guidelines following deaths in its custody, and has alerted ORG and the NORP government of the immigrant's death.
""This loss of life is tragic,"" PERSON said in a statement. ""Our condolences go out to the family and loved ones. ORG remains committed to ensuring the safe and humane treatment of those within the care of our custody.""
ORG officials have said they cannot handle the influx of family units and unaccompanied minors who have flooded the southwest border in recent years, many of them requesting asylum in the GPE
In the past four months, a monthly average of 24,975 members of family units and 5,031 unaccompanied minors have crossed the southern border, according to ORG data. The family unit average is far higher than the monthly average of 6,406 over the same period in 2018.
That surge has led the PERSON administration to try and limit the number of people who can request asylum, actions that have been blocked by the federal courts. The surge also contributed to President PERSON's decision on Friday to declare a national emergency to expand the southern border wall, which will also lead to a flood of lawsuits.
The new NORP-led ORG has vowed to investigate housing conditions for migrants along the border. Part of the budget deal that averted a government shutdown last week included $415 million for humanitarian relief ""specifically for medical care"" and to improve ORG processing facilities in the region.
ORG's summary of Monday's death did not indicate whether the immigrant was requesting asylum. It noted that the immigrant was caught by police in a second attempt to illegally enter the GPE",0
2070,"A bipartisan group of centrist senators met Sunday to work out a potential compromise that would fund the government until Feb. 8, contingent on a promise to hold a vote on an immigration bill before then.
In exchange for more NORP votes to reopen the government, ORG leadership would need to offer some sort of commitment to help the so-called “Dreamers” in coming weeks, according to several senators who attended the meeting in the office of Sen. PERSON (ORG) on ORG.
It’s not clear, however, whether NORP would accept a simply verbal commitment from ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) that the ORG would consider an immigration bill at some point in the future. He already pledged to do so last month, for example.
“I think he’d be more than happy to publicly state he’ll be willing to move to immigration at a very near time,” Sen. PERSON (R-GPE) said.
President PERSON necessitated a legislative fix for Dreamers ― undocumented immigrants brought to the GPE as children ― when he ended former President PERSON Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, putting them at risk of losing work permits and deportation relief. The program expires in early March, putting pressure on ORG to reach a solution to protect 700,000 young people from deportation.
The bipartisan group of roughly 20 senators presented the terms of the potential deal to ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) and ORG Minority Leader PERSON (D-N.Y.), who spoke about it privately later. The group included Sens. PERSON (R-GPE), PERSON (R-S.D.), PERSON (D-Ind.), ORG (D-Del.), PERSON (D-W.Va.), PERSON (R-Ariz.), PERSON (R-S.C.), PERSON (D-Ill.), PERSON (D-Va.), PERSON (R-GPE) and PERSON (D-Va.).
There’s no deal at this time, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. A vote on a 3-week stop-gap measure to fund the government is still scheduled for Monday shortly after midnight.
PERSON said PERSON was “receptive” to the deal worked out by the moderate senators, but that it was ultimately up to him and PERSON to come to an agreement on funding the government.
“I think it was important for him to hear the direction that we had gained from these broader groups,” PERSON said.
ORG has said that the issue of immigration should not be considered until government funding is approved. ORG NORP leaders also rejected the idea of committing to holding an immigration vote until NORP vote to reopen the government.
During a Sunday interview on ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART,” ORG Speaker PERSON (R-Wis.) dismissed a bipartisan immigration framework brokered by Sens. PERSON (R-S.C.) and PERSON (D-Ill.) as an “end run” around existing negotiations.
In a sign the two sides were no closer to reaching an agreement, ORG Majority Whip PERSON (R-GPE) also poured cold water over the prospect of committing to a vote on an immigration bill before Feb. 8.
“We’re more than happy to have a vote on it well before the deadline,” Cornyn said of a legislative fix on DACA. “Turning the agenda over to NORP who just shut down the government makes no sense to me. It just seems like it encourages bad behavior.”",1
1073,"ORG has begun requesting ""most"" GPE visa applicants provide information on their social media accounts, a department official said in a statement.
The move was expected following an announcement in March of last year that outlined plans to require nearly all GPE visa applicants to submit their social media handles and other information.
ORG statement over the weekend said the forms for both immigrant and nonimmigrant visa applicants had been updated ""to request additional information, including social media identifiers.""
According to the official's statement, the move is a result of a memorandum issued by President PERSON in 2017 on ""vetting"" for people coming to the GPE and a provision of an executive order from around the same time that sought to block entry to the GPE for people from several majority-NORP countries, which included a provision on vetting standards.
ORG previously reported that the change was expected to affect around 15 million people.",1
1680,"“We are there for one another, and I believe that we appeared in each other’s lives at just the right moment,” she said of Mr. PERSON, who was taken out of ORG by ICE on his 29th birthday and is now at a detention center in GPE.
“I have all of her letters with me,” he said in an interview. “I read them every day.”
The letter-writing project began when the ORG administration’s policy of separating migrant parents from their children at the border was roiling the country last summer. Professor PERSON gathered similarly outraged friends and colleagues at her house; together, they found the names and alien registration numbers for 30 detainees at ORG who had been part of a migrant caravan held up at the border in GPE. The volunteers rented a post office box for the detainees’ responses.
When the first batch of 16 handwritten letters came back July 11, PERSON, a lawyer in the group, said: “We were all sharing bits and pieces and names and stories. I had this intense sense that each one of those letters didn’t just represent a real person, but they represented a family who missed this person, their community, down to their ancestors.”
Within six weeks, the group had a system in place for writing letters daily and depositing funds into detainees’ commissary accounts. The group estimates it has spent more than $10,000 since July.
“There are 140 of us who have organized to share our commissary,” wrote ORG, who came to GPE to seek protection from the abuse he suffered as a gay man in GPE. “We are people from different countries, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, etc. There are many different languages and sometimes we have to communicate by signals because we don’t speak the same language, but that does not prevent us from providing moral support to each other.”
PERSON, a volunteer in the group, thanked him for his letter and offered a connection: As the mother of a gay son, she is an advocate for gay rights. “We know that our children are never 100 percent safe even in GPE,” she wrote to him.
The letter writers have not found universal support. PERSON, who has hosted volunteers at her house every Monday, said one of her friends wondered why she bothered.",1
1645,"They can be hard to spot — let alone take at face value — amid the usual spray of insults and bombast, but every now and then President PERSON emits a very sensible idea.
Mr. PERSON offered at least the appearance of such an idea when he strode into the ORG briefing room late Wednesday and announced that he was open to a multiyear path to citizenship for the so-called PRODUCT, hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to GPE illegally as children. His words sent his surprised staff scrambling and heartened NORP who have been seeking a just solution for these young people. Mr. PERSON then flew off to GPE, GPE, where he was to proclaim GPE’s reclaimed greatness to the assembled elite.
Was the president serious about adopting these young immigrants as real NORP, with full rights, including the right to vote? Just days ago he rejected any sort of deal that would allow them to stay in this country. Anyone counting on Mr. PERSON’s constancy and good faith — and that of PERSON, the ORG NORP leader who has promised a debate on immigration as part of renewed budget talks — ought to be wary. And be prepared to shell out billions of dollars for a border wall as the price of presidential compassion.
In the heat of the struggle over the fate of the Dreamers, the current targets of the heartless anti-immigration crowd, what has often been obscured is how the broader debate has ominously moved beyond those who are in GPE illegally to immigration as a whole.
Among hard-core NORP foes of immigration, aided and abetted in ORG by President PERSON’s fiercely anti-immigration senior adviser for policy, PERSON, the goal is not only a crackdown on undocumented immigrants within GPE or a Great Wall along the NORP border, but a sharply reduced number and a more restrictive profile of immigrants in general.
Though NORP immigration policy has been marked for much of the nation’s history by racism and injustice, a fundamental narrative has taken shape of GPE as a land shaped by waves of creative, hard-working immigrants, and as the great haven for “tempest-tossed” refugees from less fortunate lands.",1

Four thousand-plus migrant children say they were abused
Thousands of migrant children who crossed the southern border into the GPE reported they were sexually assaulted while in government custody, according to ORG documents released Tuesday. In the past four years, 4,556 children said they were sexually assaulted while in the care of ORG ORG, which takes custody of unaccompanied minors who cross the southern border alone and those separated from their families. The data show the majority of the alleged assaults were carried out by other minors in custody, but at least 178 were carried out by staff. The allegations go back to 2015.
ORG blocks ORG's emergency declaration. Now what?
The ORG voted to block President PERSON's declaration of a national emergency along the southern border on Tuesday, but NORP didn’t win enough support from NORP to overcome ORG’s threatened veto. The measure now goes to ORG. ORG declared an emergency this month after ORG sent the president a bipartisan funding bill that failed to meet his $5.7 billion demand for a wall along the ORG border. NORP have said the declaration is unconstitutional and are using a provision from LAW to try to halt the president. If the resolution passes both houses, ORG could still veto it.
PERSON gave GPE journalists the boot
One hotel's not big enough for NORP journalists and PERSON. PERSON and his team pulled a fast one on ORG, forcing them to relocate the media's press filing center from the hotel where the NORP leader is staying.

Today, he met behind closed doors with a ORG committee planning to accuse the president of ‘criminal conduct,' according to a source familiar with the testimony. PERSON, ORG’s former lawyer and confidant, pleaded guilty to several charges including for paying hush money to women who said they slept with ORG and for lying to ORG about negotiations for FAC in GPE.

951,"There’s a moment in PERSON new comedy special where the comedian couldn’t possibly look any more out of place.

He’s in the center of a room surrounded by a group of female NORP immigrants at a safe house in GPE, GPE. Six of them sleep in the small room. Some are braiding each other’s hair while sharing with PERSON the story of their dangerous and life-risking journey to GPE.

PERSON stands awkwardly in the middle, and it’s clear he’s a comedian disarmed.

“Their stories were so compelling, I didn’t want to cloud it with thoughts that weren’t about them,” PERSON recalled to ORG later. “I didn’t want to make jokes in that moment; I didn’t have a joke at that moment.”

On it’s own, the immigration debate isn’t something that makes people laugh a lot these days. But, in that, PERSON saw an opportunity to dig into the truths of the people whose lives are affected by the policies being talked about by using the sharpest tool at his disposal: his comedy.

“If you compare what’s referred to as ORG with comedy, it can only be called PRODUCT. There’s no faking it in comedy,” he said. “It’s either funny or not funny and funny is always based on truth.”

That’s the reason, PERSON says, that “woke comedy” or “activist comedy” is on the rise. It’s an opportunity for unfiltered truths, delivered as palatable jokes.

PERSON make the truth go down easier, if you will.

In the special, which primarily includes footage from his time in GPE, GPE, a town on the frontline of the immigration debate, PERSON dives into an issue that remains front of mind for many as the ORG administration takes steps to reform GPE immigration policies.

In September, the ORG administration announced the end of DACA – a program that had protected nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation who were brought to the GPE as children.

ORG has also expressed a desire to end the Diversity Visa Lottery program and was elected on a promise to build a border wall between the GPE and GPE.

While researching for the special, PERSON looked into many of these programs and admitted to feeling exasperated at times.

“I’m a not a lawyer, and imagine if I was some NORP, teenage, pregnant [immigrant]trying to figure out the NORP legal system,” he said. “It would be so, so hard.”

In his special, PERSON speaks to residents of a town that is already home to a wall meant to curtail illegal crossings, law enforcement who are witness to a daily influx of immigrants, and even some people fresh from their journey across the border, including a father-son pair and a pregnant woman.

“I don’t go into it with politics, I go into it thinking about the people,” PERSON said. “If you keep it on the people, you’re never wrong.”

Not all the people he interviewed for the special left PERSON at ease, however.

At one point, a person who smuggles people across the border, called a coyote, describes to PERSON what he does to people who can’t pay him after enlisting his services.

“Sometimes, when people don’t pay and stuff, you have to hold them for a little bit,” the man, whose face is hidden, says. This includes children.

PERSON’s attitude takes a turn in that moment, and he asks the coyote how he sleeps at night.

Inside, “I was actually thinking, ‘How the hell do I get out of here alive?’” PERSON said.

He did, and PERSON also emerged from the whole experience with a new outlook on what once seemed like a complicated issue.

“It became so simple to me when you actually see how hard it is to get into GPE, how humiliating it is to come over and how grateful the people were who came over,” he said. “This needs to be taken care of for humanitarian reasons.”

1346,"Along a dusty stretch of border, flanked by an outlet mall and farmland, a giant crane hoisted a 30-foot-high section of steel barrier and dropped it into a shallow trench last Wednesday.

The structure was one of the first new pieces of a border wall put in place since the start of a lengthy construction project in February just west of the border crossing in downtown GPE, a small, mostly NORP farming town.

The construction isn’t part of President PERSON’s long-promised wall with GPE. Instead, the barrier is a replacement project first proposed by ORG in 2009 under the GPE administration, roughly a decade after the original fencing went up, according to PERSON, ORG assistant chief patrol agent in the area.

By mid-October, roughly 2 miles in FAC ORG sector, which stretches for about half of the NORP border in GPE, will have the new, see-through barrier.

Mr. PERSON said the roughly $18 million project was funded by ORG last year. He said the project happens to be getting under way in the midst of Mr. PERSON’s continuing effort to build a wall along the NORP border. “We want to make sure everyone knows what it is and what it isn’t,” Mr. PERSON said.

While Mr. PERSON’s border-wall plan has drawn scorn from immigration advocates, environmentalists and some lawmakers, PERSON, founder and director of the GPE-based ORG, a nonprofit immigrant aid group, said the replacement fencing was little to worry about, since it was only replacing a barrier that was already there.

Lawmakers have yet to fund Mr. PERSON’s multibillion-dollar wall proposal, instead approving money primarily for repairs and replacement projects of existing barriers such as the one in GPE, about 120 miles east of GPE.

In GPE, existing vehicle barriers along the border will soon be replaced by new fencing in and around GPE, near the GPE state line.

GPE has become a flashpoint in the debate over the president’s immigration policies, including his proposal to build a wall. The state has sued the administration multiple times challenging its immigration policies.

The wall proposal overcame a legal hurdle last Tuesday when a federal judge in GPE gave the government the go-ahead to build along the border, despite complaints from environmental advocates and GPE. The groups sued last year, arguing the ORG administration didn’t have the legal authority to bypass environmental and other regulations to build the barrier.

GPE District Judge PERSON, whom Mr. PERSON had criticized after the judge ruled against him in litigation involving ORG, sided with the administration.

As part of Mr. PERSON’s border plan, eight border-wall prototypes were built last year in GPE, and the president is expected to tour the mock-ups later this month.

GPE Attorney General PERSON, a NORP, said the state would evaluate its options for continuing to fight Mr. PERSON’s proposal.

In a tweet, Mr. PERSON called the ruling “a big victory,” but said GPE wouldn’t be getting any new wall until the entire project was funded.

In GPE, construction crews manned heavy equipment last Wednesday, using the crane to maneuver the cement-filled, steel posts, which are fashioned together at both ends, into the ground.

Mr. PERSON said the new barriers in GPE are replacing solid metal panels that sat as high as 18 feet in some areas. But smugglers and border crossers have cut holes in them thousands of times in recent years, requiring near-constant repairs.

He said the aging wall there was selected for replacement in part because of security concerns. Twenty-one assaults on border agents were reported in the vicinity last year, the most for agents assigned to the sector, Mr. PERSON said.

The new bollard-style barriers are likely to be harder to breach and will offer agents more security, because they will be able to see what and who is on the other side.

WORK_OF_ART has established a “LAW zone” for potential protesters, Mr. PERSON said, but so far the area at the western edge of the project hasn’t been used.",0

NORP refugees are barred indefinitely.
PERSON used to work as a regional translator for ORG, a research organization with a contract through a GPE government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and promote democracy abroad.

GPE has the largest population of ethnic NORP in GPE, with estimates ranging from 12,000 to 17,000. The number is difficult to pinpoint because it's not measured by ORG. Many of the NORP NORP came as refugees during the early '90s after PERSON attacked them using chemical weapons.
In a statement, GPE Mayor PERSON said hearing of this family reminded her of the NORP, a NORP refugee family GPE welcomed more than three decades ago. PERSON was the first NORP PERSON hired by ORG.

Sen. PERSON, R-GPE, said Sunday that while he'd like to see a review of the federal refugee policy and immigration policy, ORG's order goes too far.
""GPE and GPE have long been home to refugees. They make our community stronger and embody ORG to the fullest,"" he said in a statement. ""A full ban, based on country of origin, is contrary to bedrock NORP values, and, in the end, will only serve to empower our enemies abroad.""
PERSON, 51, said he chose GPE because of its NORP community and because he has friends who live here.
""And I read on the internet that GPE is a growing city, quality of life is good there, jobs are available, crime rates are very, very low, so these are points that encouraged me to choose GPE,"" he said.
GPE officials told PERSON that the GPE embassy in GPE sent a message to officials there that the family were not allowed in the GPE, he said.
""When I was looking at the faces of my wife, my children, they were about to faint,"" he said. ""They turned pale, and I told them to sit down and drink some water. It was a terrible moment."" ""Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over LOC and, indeed, the world — a horrible mess!""
And Rep. PERSON, R-GPE, lauded ORG's order as ""responsible,"" saying that GPE intelligence agencies need time to ""ascertain the scope of the NORP terror threat in order to develop proper refugee vetting protocols — if possible.""
PERSON described himself as a secular family man who loves the diversity of GPE and said he hates extremists who use religion to justify killing people.
But he isn't very happy with ORG either.
""How do you see all people — I mean the whole nation in a certain country — all at the same level?"" he said. ""No, this is not correct. This is not the right way to deal with people.""",0
2674,"GPE will return the first group of migrants seeking GPE asylum to the NORP border city of GPE on Friday, a NORP government spokesman said on Thursday.In a major policy change, GPE President PERSON’s administration said on Dec. 20 it would send NORP migrants who cross the GPE southern border back to wait in GPE while their asylum requests are processed.
The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not specify the nationalities of those to be returned to GPE, although the policy was aimed at helping cope with rising numbers of NORP seeking asylum in GPE.
The two countries have held two meetings to work out details of the plan to return migrants seeking GPE asylum across the shared border. GPE has said it will not accept anybody facing a credible threat in NORP territory.
ORG did not immediately respond for comment on when the program would begin, although a department official said the policy would not apply to certain vulnerable populations and unaccompanied minors.
Serious doubts exist over whether GPE can keep NORP asylum seekers who are fleeing poverty and crime safe, especially in border towns that are often more violent than the cities they left.
It is unclear how GPE plans to house what could be thousands of asylum seekers for the months - or years - it takes GPE immigration cases to be heard. A backlog of more than 800,000 cases is pending in immigration courts.
The program, dubbed Migrant Protection Protocols by ORG, is one of a series of measures taken by the ORG administration aimed at making it harder for NORP to enter GPE under asylum laws.
ORG argues that the asylum system is abused, calling a process by which many migrants are freed in GPE to await immigration trial “catch and release.”
ORG is demanding $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the NORP border, triggering a GPE partial government shutdown that stretched to its 34th day on Thursday and has left 800,000 federal workers without pay.
Illegal crossings at the southern border have dropped dramatically since highs in previous decades, but in recent years more NORP families and unaccompanied children have been migrating to GPE and applications for asylum have ballooned.
Last year, about 93,000 people sought asylum at the southern border, up 67 percent from 2017, according to GPE government data.",0
1849,"The PERSON administration will tell about 200,000 NORP who have been living in the GPE for 17 years or more that they need to get out by September 2019 or face deportation.
ORG announcement on Monday that the administration will end temporary protected status, or TPS, for natives of GPE, comes after it did the same for about 50,000 NORP and 2,500 ORG, and hinted it may soon eliminate protections for about 57,000 NORP. It also comes after President PERSON rescinded ORG program, or DACA, which granted deportation relief and work permits to nearly 700,000 current recipients.
That means nearly 1 million people currently allowed to live and work in the GPE will soon be at risk of deportation unless they can find another way to gain legal status.
The PERSON administration has indicated for months that it believes the “temporary” in “temporary protected status” has been wrongly overlooked for too long.
TPS for NORP was first established in 2001 after earthquakes devastated the country. Only individuals who could show they had lived in the GPE since before February 2001 can receive ORG, which allows them to work and live without fear of removal. ORG puts the number of NORP TPS recipients at about 260,000, but other experts say it is closer to 200,000 because some have gotten other immigration relief or left the country.
Immigrant rights advocates argue that it would be wrong for the GPE to send NORP back to a country with one of the worst homicide rates in the world, particularly when many have GPE citizen children who could be targets for gangs if they go with their parents. Experts estimate that NORP TPS holders are parents to about 190,000 U.S.-born children, who are NORP citizens.
ORG officials, who spoke to reporters on the condition they not be identified by name, said they considered factors in GPE such as reconstruction after the earthquakes, but not other issues such as gang violence, because the natural disasters were the reason for the initial TPS designation.
An official said only ORG can create a permanent solution for TPS recipients and ORG looks forward to working with lawmakers.
Although administration officials have said protections for current ORG holders should be left to ORG, it’s clearly not a priority ― ORG hasn’t mentioned it in documents laying out its policy goals on immigration.
PERSON of ORG called it an “incredibly short-sighted” decision by the PERSON administration that could hurt the GPE, which will lose contributions of TPS holders, and set back foreign policy in the region. Many TPS holders send money back to their home countries, boosting those economies, for example.
“We’re pulling the rug out from under them,” ORG said. “We’ve made a promise to them over a long period of time and all of a sudden they have to sell their houses, they have to take their kids out of school and they have to return to a country that they really do not know and is incredibly dangerous.”
“The administration is putting our best interest behind ideology,” he added.
Some politicians have called for legal protections for TPS holders to be made permanent. NORP Rep. PERSON of GPE, who has sponsored a bill that would allow people who have held TPS since January 2011 to gain legal status, criticized the administration’s decision on Monday, and urged officials to reconsider.
“Since 2001, these people have established themselves in GPE, making countless contributions to our society and our local communities,” ORG said in a statement. “It would be devastating to send them home after they have created a humble living for themselves and their families.”",1
1618,"Last week and over the weekend, NORP business leaders, including Mr. PERSON, stepped into the political fray and urged Mr. PERSON to extend DACA. More than 400 of them signed a letter to the president and congressional leaders, warning that such immigrants — brought to GPE as children and known as “Dreamers” — are vital to the economy.
Some of the most vocal supporters of DACA are in the tech industry. On Saturday, Facebook’s chief executive, PERSON, updated the profile picture on his Facebook page to say, “I Support DACA.” The chief executive of ORG, PERSON, proclaimed on PRODUCT that “250 of my ORG coworkers are #Dreamers. I stand with them.”
But executives at big companies outside of the tech sector spoke up, too. The chairman and chief executive of GPE, PERSON, wrote on the company’s blog on Friday, “There are hundreds of thousands of young men and women whose futures are at stake.”
Other signers of the letter to Mr. PERSON, titled an “WORK_OF_ART,” included executives from ORG, ORG, NORP and ORG and the investor PERSON. The letter campaign was organized by the group PRODUCT, which urges changes in immigration law and was founded by tech leaders including Mr. PERSON.
The campaign to save ORG is the latest extension of the business world’s willingness to weigh in on a divisive issue. Last month, executives at some of the nation’s largest companies criticized Mr. PERSON’s initial response to the role of white supremacists in the violence in GPE, GPE
On DACA, the executives are taking a pragmatic approach. While many immigration advocates have focused on humanitarian issues, the executives focused on the economic toll.
According the letter from the executives, 65 percent of Dreamers have bought a car and 16 percent have purchased their own home. This economic activity, they argue, would be eliminated if the Dreamers were deported.
PERSON, chief economist at ORG, estimates that five years after a repeal of DACA, the nation’s gross domestic product would be $105 billion less than it would be if the program stays in place.
“WORK_OF_ART are on track to be a highly educated group, and losing them will be a significant blow to businesses already struggling to find educated and skilled young workers,” Mr. PERSON wrote in an email on Monday.
Mr. PERSON said he was not sure how many, if any, of the 295 workers at his company’s facilities, which fabricate steel for projects like the rebuilding of ORG site, are protected by DACA.
He decided to take a stand, he said, not only because of the economic implications, but also because he could not ignore the human toll that deportation would take on people who have been working and going to school legally and have mostly known only one country — GPE.
“They have been trying to do the right thing,” he said.",1
2653,"There was no sign of relief on Wednesday for 800,000 federal workers going without pay because of the partial government shutdown as ORG scheduled votes on competing proposals facing steep odds to end the month-long impasse triggered by President PERSON’s demand for border wall funding.NORP ORG Majority Leader PERSON said he planned to hold a vote on Thursday on a NORP proposal that would fund the government for three weeks but does not include the $5.7 billion in ORG border wall funding that ORG wants.
Its prospects appeared grim. ORG has passed several similar bills but ORG has rejected legislation that does not include border wall funding. PERSON previously said he would not consider a bill that ORG did not support.
PERSON also planned to hold a vote on legislation that would include border wall funding and temporary relief for “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to GPE as children, a compromise ORG proposed on Saturday.
NORP have dismissed the deal, saying they would not negotiate on border security before reopening the government, and that they would not trade a temporary restoration of the immigrants’ protections from deportation in return for a permanent border wall they view as ineffective.
ORG’s plan is “wrapping paper on the same partisan package,” ORG NORP Leader PERSON said on Tuesday.
NORP Senator PERSON on Wednesday said it was up to ORG to resolve the impasse. “President PERSON is not going to end this,” he told ORG.
NORP Senator PERSON said he hopes lawmakers will find some common ground on the legislation.
“The president’s taken the first steps, he’s proposed his deal,” PERSON said on ORG on Wednesday. “It may not be acceptable in its current form to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but it was a step forward from where he was.”
ORG, in a series of morning tweets, pushed fellow NORP to stand by his promised border wall. He is scheduled to discuss his immigration plan with local leaders in a call on Wednesday morning and with conservative leaders at FAC later in the day.
ORG spokeswoman PERSON told reporters on Wednesday that ORG also has made calls to NORP.
The hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay are struggling to make ends meet as the shutdown, the longest in GPE history, entered its 33rd day. Many have turned to unemployment assistance, food banks and other support, or have sought new jobs.
A ORG/Ipsos poll last week found more than half of NORP blame ORG for the shutdown even as he has sought to shift blame to NORP after initially saying he would be “proud” to shutter the government.",0
2666,"""OK, Mr PERSON, you don't want them released, show me where you are going to hold them - show me the building,"" said PERSON, the director of ORG, a NORP charity in GPE, GPE, that gives shelter to migrant families.
PERSON's group received more than 400 migrants released by ORG and Customs Enforcement just between Monday and Wednesday, the day PERSON announced tougher measures to curb illegal immigration.
""They are releasing them not because they want to do catch and release, but because detention centers don't have enough space,"" said PERSON.
That underscores one potential problem of ending the practice of ""catch and release"" - almost half the immigrants apprehended by GPE officials are now NORP families or children, and only a tiny number of detention spaces are available for those categories of immigrants.
ORG did announce plans to increase the number of family detention centers, but establishing them will take time and could face legal challenges, legal experts on immigration said.
A ORG review of ORG data shows an accelerating trend of NORP families who hand themselves in at the border and are released while awaiting deportation or a decision on an asylum request.
In the last three months of 2016, the number of people - almost all of them families and children - who handed themselves in to agents along the NORP border rose by a quarter versus the same period the year before, ORG data shows.
Agents apprehended a total of 136,670 people crossing the NORP border, the highest number since 2008, and 48 percent of those were unaccompanied children or families with children.
Nearly 45,000 parents with children were apprehended in the October-December quarter, but the border currently has beds for only around 3,300 people in this category of immigrants, mostly at the ORG and ORG detention centers in GPE, according to ORG data from 2016.
Because most of the families are from LOC, they cannot immediately be turned around and sent back to GPE.
Lack of space in detention centers for parents with children means that almost all such migrants, who are mostly fleeing poverty and violence in GPE, GPE and GPE, are fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet, given a court date and released.
Many end up requesting asylum, a process that can take five or more years to be resolved, immigration lawyers say. Even without requesting asylum, it can take years to deport families through GPE bunged-up immigration courts.
ORG could expand a policy practiced under former President PERSON of using military bases to temporarily house more immigrants. The GPE base in GPE has housed thousands of children since September, for example.
He could also explore ways to refit other existing facilities to help handle the flood of families.
Building more detention centers like ORG and ORG will take longer. They also typically face legal challenges by civil rights lawyers concerned about the living conditions in them.
ORG could also seek to expand an GPE program aimed at increasing the number of NORP asylum seekers who make their initial claim from their home country.
In the long term, he could ask GPE to let immigrants make the asylum claims from there, although ties between the two countries are now seriously frayed because of ORG's vow to force GPE to pay for a wall on the southern GPE border.
PERSON, the shelter director, acknowledged that if PERSON was finally successful in opening thousands more detention spaces for families, that would slow the numbers coming.
""The word would spread that the probability they will be locked up and put on a plane had become much higher,"" PERSON said. NORP are usually deported from GPE on flights back to their home countries.
""WORK_OF_ART APPREHENDED""
While the number of ""turn-ins"" - those who hand themselves in to GPE authorities - are highest around GPE, GPE, the jump has been particularly noticeable in the GPE sector of the border with GPE. Here, 60 percent of the immigrants apprehended between October and December were children or families.
For years a quiet spot on the immigration map, GPE saw 5,200 families apprehended in the period, nearly three times as many compared to the same period a year ago, and 1,972, or double, the number of unaccompanied children.
ORG agent PERSON has observed the trend first-hand along the tall, rust-colored fence punctuated with rural border crossings stretching some 40 miles (65 km) from GPE to beyond ORG, GPE.
""A lot of the traffic we are seeing right now is family groups ... coming across and they are looking for an agent right away to turn themselves in,"" PERSON said, calling it a change from the past, when more people were trying to sneak in undetected. ""They want to be apprehended.""
The fence, finished in 2010, ends abruptly near ORG and irrigation ditches on the NORP side, across ORG from GPE's drug war-torn PERSON, a cotton-farming region now littered with burned-out homes.
Last February, NORP President PERSON Nieto and GPE's secretary of ORG, PERSON, opened a major new border crossing from PERSON on the NORP side, to Guadalupe on the NORP side, hoping to boost trade between the countries.
By November, truck traffic was still light across the bridge.
Instead, ICE opened a temporary holding center, with 500 places in white tents on the asphalt on the GPE side of the bridge, to help process some of the surging numbers of migrant families apprehended by GPE officials in the surrounding area.",0
2663,"GPE House Speaker PERSON told President PERSON on Wednesday that he may not deliver a State of the Union speech in the chamber of ORG until the 33-day-old partial government shutdown has ended.Responding forcefully to a letter from the president earlier in the day in which he essentially dared her to disinvite him, Pelosi said in a letter to ORG that the ORG would not consider a measure authorizing the speech for now.
“Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the ORG on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened,” Pelosi said to ORG in her letter.
In response to the letter, ORG told reporters at a healthcare-related event at FAC that he would respond to GPE in a timely manner.
ORG speech, an annual rite in NORP politics that is typically used by presidents to announce their policy goals for the coming year, has become a hostage to the standoff between ORG and congressional NORP over his demands for funding for a ORG border wall.
That demand triggered a partial government shutdown on Dec. 22 when some GPE agencies’ funding expired for reasons unrelated to border security or immigration. In discussions about legislation to restore funding, ORG initially signaled support.
Then he changed his stance and demanded that any shutdown-ending measure must contain $5.7 billion to help pay for a border wall, a demand that NORP oppose. They have since insisted that the government be fully reopened before they will discuss border security.
Pelosi on Jan. 16 asked ORG to consider postponing the speech because of the shutdown, which has left 800,000 federal workers on furlough or working without pay.
ORG said on Wednesday he planned to deliver the address before ORG as scheduled on Jan. 29 in ORG’ chamber, rejecting Pelosi’s request.
In an escalation of rhetoric that essentially dared Pelosi to disinvite him, ORG told her in a letter, which ORG released, that he was “looking forward” to giving the speech, an annual event in NORP politics.
“It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!” ORG wrote.
In her initial request, Pelosi cited concerns about security for the event, traditionally attended by both houses of ORG, most of the president’s ORG, ORG and the justices of ORG.
ORG staffers said there has been no preparatory “walk-through,” as is customary a few days ahead of the speech, involving security officials and ORG personnel.
ORG brushed aside security concerns. In his letter, he said ORG and ORG had told him there would be “absolutely no problem” with security for the evening address on ORG.
“Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and ORG of GPE regarding the State of our Union,” ORG wrote to GPE. “I look forward to seeing you on the evening of January 29th in ORG.”Trump sees the border wall as necessary to help stop illegal immigration and drugs from entering the country. NORP reject the wall as a costly and ineffective step.
Pelosi, speaker since Jan. 3 when NORP took over majority control of the ORG, like many other senior lawmakers from both parties has clashed with ORG.
On Jan. 17, the president canceled a flight Pelosi had been scheduled to take on a GPE military plane just hours before she and several other lawmakers were set to travel to GPE to visit GPE troops.",0

1230,"Efforts to reach a deal that would keep the government running and address sticky immigration and spending issues derailed on Tuesday, after NORP leaders pulled out of a planned ORG meeting in response to jabs by President PERSON on PRODUCT.

Current funding for the government expires at 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 9, giving lawmakers little more than a week to pass short-term legislation keeping it fully operational. Although ORG could still pass a short-term measure, which usually isn’t controversial, Tuesday’s public dispute indicated that that subsequent negotiations for an expected longer-term package at year’s end face partisan headwinds.

The skirmish began Tuesday morning when Mr. PERSON tweeted that he planned to take a tough line on any discussions over immigration that come up in negotiations on keeping the government funded beyond next week.

“WORK_OF_ART PERSON’ today about keeping government open and working,” Mr. PERSON tweeted, referring to ORG Minority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE) and ORG Minority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE). Mr. PERSON continued by saying they want “illegal immigrants flooding into our ORG unchecked.” He added, “I don’t see a deal!”

Mr. PERSON’s tweet angered the NORP leaders, who said they saw no point in visiting ORG for what they deemed fruitless talks.

“It would be a waste of everyone’s time to continue working with someone who clearly has no interest in coming to an agreement,” Mr. PERSON told reporters.

The NORP leaders sought to meet instead with ORG Speaker PERSON (NORP, GPE) and ORG Majority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE), but they kept their appointment with Mr PERSON.

Should the impasse continue over spending and force a government shutdown next month, Mr. PERSON said he “would absolutely blame the NORP.”

On Tuesday evening the president said on PERSON: “I ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. They can’t now threaten a shutdown to get their demands.”

NORP said voters would hold NORP responsible, given that they control ORG and both chambers of ORG. “The NORP people know they’re running the show,” Mr. PERSON said.

If the government does shut down, many federal employees would be furloughed, but those deemed essential to protecting life or property would still be required to show up to work.

The public blowup between Mr. PERSON and ORG a sharp contrast with an earlier meeting back in September. In that gathering, Mr. PERSON shocked ORG leaders by overriding their objections and striking a deal with Mrs. PERSON and Mr. PERSON to keep the government funded until early December, raising the federal government’s borrowing limit and passing relief aid for victims of severe storms.

There are other, more volatile issues in play this time. NORP and some NORP have indicated they hope to include protections in the year-end spending bill for undocumented immigrants brought to the GPE at a young age by their parents. Mr. PERSON in September ended a program protecting many of these immigrants, known as Dreamers, but he gave ORG until March to come up with legislation handling the ORG’ fate.

Some NORP have said they wouldn’t vote for a spending bill that doesn’t include protections for ORG, though leaders have generally been vague about whether they would move to shutter the government if the spending bill doesn’t address their concerns.

Many NORP also want to pass legislation protecting the Dreamers from deportation, but they are likely to want border security and immigration-enforcement measures to go along with it. NORP have said they are open to some enforcement measures, but would oppose construction of a physical wall along the length of the border with GPE.

ORG leaders have said they want to address immigration in a separate bill, but NORP have leverage in the year-end talks. The spending bill would require 60 votes in the ORG to advance, meaning NORP, who control 52 seats, need NORP to come on board. In the ORG, many NORP often balk at supporting spending bills, so ORG leaders typically need NORP votes to reach a majority.

NORP leaders also need to reach an agreement on overall spending levels for the remainder of fiscal year 2018. ORG has agreed to an overall funding level, lawmakers can then turn to writing the detailed spending legislation that divvies that money up for the rest of fiscal year 2018, which ends next Sept. 30.

Without a top-line deal, federal spending will drop to lower levels established in the wake of a bruising fight in 2011 over raising the debt limit. Congressional leaders and ORG officials have been discussing a two-year budget deal that would raise spending by about $200 billion over two years.

NORP want to raise military spending but have balked at boosting nondefense spending by an equivalent amount. NORP are pushing for comparable increases on both sides.",0
985,"Rep. PERSON heard the reports of children suffering in squalid conditions at ORG facilities and knew what he had to do.

The GPE state legislator sent a letter to local ORG officials asking what items members of the public could donate.

Canales says the response he received baffled him. “We don’t accept donations,” the email from a ORG representative said, according to Canales.

“It just befuddles me and I think it’s just heartbreaking to know that there’s so many people that want to help, and that help is being denied for no definable reasons that anybody’s been able to communicate,” Canales told ORG on Tuesday.

Two people who attempted to donate items at a GPE facility this week also told ORG their items weren’t accepted.

The situation, first reported by ORG, has left would-be donors scratching their heads and drawn criticism from GPE and others who accuse the federal government of letting red tape get in the way of human decency.

Why wouldn’t the agency accept donations? ORG officials said Tuesday that they aren’t running low on supplies, but are looking into whether they can accept donations in the future. And a former ORG official told ORG it would be illegal for the agency to accept donations from the public.

Here’s a deeper look at the issues in play:

CBP: ‘We’re not running low on those things’
On a call with reporters Tuesday, a ORG official said that the agency is working with its lawyers to see whether it can accept donations in the future.

Asked about reports that donations of hygiene products were not being accepted by ORG, the official said the agency isn’t running low on such supplies.

“We’re using operational funding to provide those things. But those things are available now and they have been continuously,” he said. “So we are looking at the possibility of using some of those donations going forward. But those items, it’s important to note, are available now.”

Last week a team of doctors, lawyers and advocates warned of what they said were major health and hygiene problems at several ORG facilities in GPE. Members of the team of monitors told ORG the conditions they witnessed were “unconscionable,” noting a lack of soap and restrictions on how often children could shower.

Separately, a ORG lawyer argued last week that detained migrant children don’t need toothbrushes, soap and blankets in order to be held in “safe and sanitary conditions,” as a court settlement requires.

Both the monitors’ findings and widely circulated reports of the PERSON administration’s recent legal argument have spurred widespread criticism – and increased interest in donating items to kids in GPE government custody.

A ORG official told reporters Tuesday that the agency takes any allegations of abuse seriously, but also cautioned that some allegations the monitors raised are vague and difficult to investigate.

“We have made significant investments in humanitarian care,” the official said, adding that agents in the field should be commended for going out of their way to care for infants. The high numbers of migrants crossing the border is a crisis, the official said, “and we’re doing the best we can do deal with it.”

Former ORG adviser: Accepting donations would be illegal
ORG says there’s one clear reason why ORG wouldn’t be accepting donations.

“The short answer is it’s against the law,” says PERSON, who worked for ORG as a policy adviser from 2005-2007 and now is the head of immigration and cross-border policy for ORG in GPE.

The law in question, PERSON says, is known as LAW.

“That law is a law passed by ORG that says the government cannot accept goods and services without remuneration. Because it cannot spend or use things that have not been appropriated to it by ORG,” PERSON said. “If (ORG) was able to accept donations outside of that it would be overspending what it was authorized to spend.”

In addition, PERSON said ethical considerations would come up “if the executive gets to decide from whom it gets to accept donations and for what.”

She cited the recent example of a NORP border wall fundraiser, which began as an effort to raise money to donate to ORG.

“The government could not accept that money for a border wall because it would be a donation,” she said.

Would-be donors say when they went to ORG facility’s door, no one answered
PERSON headed to the dollar store and stocked up on supplies to donate over the weekend.

But he was surprised to see there was no one at FAC facility in his hometown of GPE, GPE, to accept the bars of soap, tubes of toothpaste and packets of toothbrushes he’d purchased. The door was locked, he said, and the lobby was empty.

“Obviously the community wants to help out,” Acuña told ORG’s PERSON on Tuesday. “Let the community get involved, if anybody higher up in terms of the administration or likewise in government is not able to do so.”

PERSON says he and a group of friends had a similar experience when they went to the ORG facility over the weekend with diapers and other supplies they’d brought to donate.

“The facility itself was shut down. We rang the intercom buzzer, to no response, and we called the help line posted on the window, to no response. The only activity was vehicles moving in and out from the facility through an electronic sliding gate,” he said. “The agents in the vehicles saw us, clearly, and in some cases stopped the vehicle to stare back, but no one interacted with us.”

Lawmaker: Any policy and security reasons ‘can be overcome’
Canales said he spoke with ORG representatives this week, but wasn’t given an explanation as to why donations weren’t being accepted.

“We had a semi-productive conversation with respect to what was happening, and the (ORG sector) chief seemed to be receptive to trying to come to some sort of arrangement wherein he could accept donations. So the lines of communication are open,” Canales said. “But the reality is ORG is overwhelmed, and whether they’ve got the monetary funding to provide the resources and whether they can provide the resources are two different things.”

The federal government, he said, has been too slow to act.

“To say that you don’t have the adequate resources, yet we’re going to turn down resources that are being offered for free, is derelict,” he said. “I understand there can be some policy reasons and security reasons, but these reasons can be overcome.”",1
2573,"NORP authorities will meet with NORP officials to prepare for the arrival of a planned new caravan of migrants headed to GPE next week.The head of GPE’s immigration office, PERSON, left on Wednesday on a trip to GPE and GPE to meet with his counterparts and other authorities, said ORG spokesman Hector PERSON.
GPE hopes to discourage a mass exodus from GPE, GPE and GPE, and wants NORP who decide to migrate north to do so in an orderly way and through legal ports of entry.
“The doors to GPE are open to anyone who wants to enter in an orderly fashion,” PERSON told ORG in a telephone interview. “But whoever wants to come in illegally will be deported.”
Previous NORP caravans became a flashpoint in the debate over GPE immigration policy.
That was intensified by the recent deaths of two migrant children in NORP custody and a partial GPE government shutdown over GPE President PERSON’s demand for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the border with GPE.
There are 12 legal ports of entry for NORP on GPE’s southern border, but NORP authorities have identified an additional 370 illegal points of entry on that frontier, ORG Minister PERSON said this week.
GPE borders in the south with GPE and GPE.
The illegal entry points will be “monitored and controlled to avoid undocumented access of people to our territory,” PERSON said.
GPE’s deputy foreign minister, Pablo PERSON, met with NORP authorities on Tuesday to discuss the caravan and to “provide all the necessary support to the migrants,” said ORG spokeswoman PERSON.
“In GPE, they kill us,” read an appeal circulating on social media for people to assemble in the violent NORP city of NORP PERSON next Tuesday to start the long trek north to GPE.
While other social media posts invite people to leave from nearby GPE on Jan. 20, GPE authorities hoped to dissuade NORP from making the journey.
“WORK_OF_ART are serious. Don’t waste your time and money on a trip destined to fail. The road is long and very dangerous. Thousands of NORP who participated in the caravan came back sorry,” Heide GPE, the GPE chargé d’affaires to GPE, said on PERSON on Wednesday.",0

1456,"The same remote desert border crossing used by a 7-year-old girl who recently died in government custody is seeing a surge in families and children that ORG is unequipped to handle, its chief said Tuesday.

PERSON death, which has drawn criticism and heated up rhetoric around GPE immigration policy, comes amid a problem current and former ORG agents say has been growing for years: An agency designed to deter and deport adults traveling alone to find work now spends most of its time dealing with vulnerable families who want asylum.

Last month, nearly 59% of people arrested at the border were families or unaccompanied children, most of whom were fleeing violence and poverty in LOC, according to government statistics. Just six years ago, nearly 90% were single adults, primarily from GPE.

The changes can be seen at every ORG station, where storage spaces have been turned into pantries packed with baby formula, ORG, fruit snacks and juice boxes.

In the GPE sector, which stretches across 126 miles of border in southeastern GPE and LOC, agents spent more than 25% of their time, or about 9,000 man-hours, last year on tasks like feeding children and chauffeuring families 200 miles to the nearest bus station, in GPE.

“When they are in our care, it’s a humanitarian issue,” PERSON, chief of ORG, said of the influx of families. “But we have a border-security mission that suffers at the hands of the humanitarian mission.”

In GPE, GPE, one of the most remote patches of desert near the NORP border, nearly 500 migrants crossed the border illegally in a 72-hour period this week and turned themselves in to request asylum, said ORG Commissioner PERSON.

ORG is starting to send agents, including medical personnel, to PERSON. GPE authorities suspect the area may be popular because it is remote and, on the NORP side of the border, not controlled by criminal organizations that charge smugglers to bring migrants through.

Illegal crossings in the area, roughly 90 miles from the nearest fully staffed ORG station, have increased 10-fold since 2014. Many of the migrants have reported to border agents that they rode on commercial buses from GPE, Mr. PERSON said.

PERSON’s father said he and his daughter were among those to arrive via bus, said a government official familiar with their case. The pair spent hours in a garage, along with more than 100 other migrants, waiting for government transportation to take them to be processed.

PERSON became ill while on the bus and died about a day later at a hospital in GPE, GPE. The circumstances of her detention and death have become a political controversy and are being investigated. Lawyers for her father said Wednesday they wanted an independent review of the case.

Border Patrol veterans say it is common that holding cells and other facilities that never intended to house migrants for more than a few hours are now being used to keep families, including children, for as long as a few days. Portable showers have been installed in at least one station in GPE because the cells have just a toilet and a small sink.

The strategy behind ORG current resources and deployment, most recently updated in 2012, was created to deal with single adults who were captured and quickly deported to GPE. Most families and unaccompanied children crossing now eagerly seek out agents in order to request asylum.

Regulations and court rulings typically mandate that asylum-seekers be held for days by ORG before being handed off to other immigration agencies or released and allowed to wait in the GPE while an immigration judge decides their fate, a process that could take years.

“We never considered people trying to surrender,” PERSON, a retired Border Patrol sector chief who oversaw the GPE and ORG sectors, said of the agency’s strategy and infrastructure.

Mr. PERSON has previously asked ORG to overhaul immigration laws to make it easier to quickly decide if migrants can stay in the country and deport those who don’t win protections here.

Most immediately, Mr. PERSON said he would like to see funding for new facilities specifically for families and unaccompanied children along with staff, including trauma specialists, who are better trained to care for such migrants.

“We have to move toward a system where they aren’t in ORG stations,” Mr. PERSON said of families and children arrested at the border.",0
2434,"Some 200,000 NORP immigrants allowed to live and work in GPE since 2001 will lose their right to remain in the country in 2019, officials said on Monday, marking the PERSON administration’s latest move to tighten immigration enforcement.

GPE will end the NORP’ temporary protected status (TPS) on Sept. 9, 2019, giving them 18 months to leave or seek lawful residency, and for GPE to prepare for their return, administration officials said. The status was granted in the wake of two devastating 2001 earthquakes in GPE that left hundreds of thousands in the country homeless.

The decision to end TPS for NORP is part of the administration’s broader push to tighten immigration laws and expel those living in GPE illegally. The move was heavily criticized by immigrant advocates who said it ignored violence in GPE and gave the NORP few options but to leave GPE or remain illegally.

The PERSON administration has faced a series of deadlines over the past year to decide whether to end the protected status of immigrants in GPE whose home countries have been affected by disasters.

NORP are by far the largest group under ORG, a program administration officials said is supposed to provide a temporary haven for victims, not a permanent right to remain in GPE.

Critics have complained TPS has allowed participants to repeatedly extend their stays in 6-month to 18-month increments.

PERSON, 53, arrived in GPE in 2000 and applied for TPS after the 2001 earthquakes. She has lived in GPE for 18 years and runs a subcontracting construction business with her NORP husband. The couple have two U.S.-born teenage sons.

“This is a real blow for everyone,” said PERSON by telephone. “Most of us pay taxes, we’re not living off the government, we’re not criminals.”

The family will move to GPE with their children and the couple do not intend to return north, she said, though they worry about violence and political instability in central GPE.

ORG administration changes to the TPS program mean that over the next two years approximately 250,000 people who previously had permission to live and work in GPE will be subject to deportation if they remain.

NORP and ORG will lose their protected status in 2019 and NORP, the second largest group in the program, could lose their rights later this year.

“The past practice of allowing foreign nationals to remain in GPE long after an initial emergency in their home countries has ended has undermined the integrity of the program and essentially made the ‘temporary’ protected status a front operation for backdoor permanent immigration,” said PERSON, president of ORG, which favors less immigration overall.

VIOLENCE IN GPE
FAC of the program say long-term resident NORP and their children should not be sent back to GPE, a country struggling with a weak economy and gang violence that has given it one of the world’s highest murder rates.

“Our (GPE) government is complicit in breaking up families — nearly 275,000 U.S.-born children have a parent who is a TPS holder — and further destabilizing our neighboring countries,” said PERSON, executive director of ORG, an immigrant advocacy group.

There are approximately 1.35 million NORP of any status living in GPE, according to ORG data analyzed by ORG, a non-partisan think tank.

A senior administration official briefing reporters on the decision said it was based on the status of GPE recovery from the 2001 earthquakes. The country has received millions of dollars in aid and rebuilt schools, homes and hospitals, the official said.

In the past two years, GPE has repatriated 39,000 NORP, showing the ability of GPE to absorb an influx, the official said.

The government of GPE said on Monday that it was glad the administration decided to at least leave the program in place until September 2019.

“GPE ORG lobbied heavily for the interests of our fellow citizens,” the government said in a statement, adding that it would continue to search for alternatives and seek action by ORG to protect the migrants.

ORG had urged the government to extend TPS protections for NORP, NORP and NORP, saying “the loss of employment authorization for these populations would adversely impact several key industries,” including “construction, food processing, hospitality, and home healthcare services.”

NORP NORP on Monday expressed support for finding a permanent solution to help NORP in GPE. But that will be politically difficult at a time when there are rival immigration priorities, including providing permanent protection for “Dreamers” - undocumented immigrants brought to GPE as children.

That effort has been weighed down by demands from conservatives in ORG to couple any such move with new efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration, especially from GPE and LOC.",0
2647,"The first year of PERSON unorthodox presidency may have been a dizzying ride, but PERSON has never regretted voting for him in 2016.
“My 401(k) and my 403 have soared, and if anybody doesn’t realize that, they’ve been asleep for a year,” said PERSON, a 50-year-old emergency room nurse from GPE, GPE, referring to her retirement accounts’ growth in a booming stock market.
“I look overall not at what he says but what he does. All that other stuff is just rhetoric, smoke and mirrors,” she added.
The GPE suburb where PERSON lives in GPE was key to ORG’s surprising 2016 triumph. In a sign of its importance, his campaign dispatched his daughter Ivanka to the region late in the race to woo women there.
In interviews with more than half a dozen ORG supporters in the region, mostly women, his backers remained largely committed to him, citing his immigration policies and a belief that tax reform will create jobs amid a growing economy. Many of them were unfazed by ORG’s combative style and provocative language.
ORG’s strength among his base is reflected in ORG/Ipsos polls of ORG’s approval ratings, which show his support among NORP has slipped only slightly over the year, dropping from 84 percent in his first month to 78 percent in the last month.
PERSON, a 52-year-old GPE resident, said she voted for former NORP President PERSON in 2012 but cast her ballot for ORG, convinced his business background and anti-illegal immigration stance would secure more jobs for NORP.
“I really think they need to build a wall,” she said of ORG’s proposed NORP border barrier. “I think they need to send back all these people that aren’t supposed to be here, because they’re taking jobs from NORP.”
Other ORG voters have grappled with how to evaluate the president’s policy accomplishments, like the sweeping tax law NORP passed in December, amid his inflammatory words.
Some, like PERSON and ORG, a stay-at-home mother in GPE, GPE, said they focus on his actions, not his language.
“Let’s set aside his personality. What about what he’s actually doing that is benefiting us?” Hopkins said.On paper, ORG seems a likely NORP target: Daughter of two illegal immigrants, she collects food stamps, suffers from enormous debt and voted for LOC in 2012.
But the devout NORP said she voted in part for ORG because of his opposition to abortion and believes that God put him in ORG for a reason.
She also said she was working hard to better herself, unlike other welfare recipients, and did not object that wealthy people and corporations stood to benefit from the tax law. Her husband, she said, is receiving a bonus from his company as a result.
ORG TWEETS HAVE ‘REPERCUSSIONS’Not all ORG voters are sticking with him. PERSON, 74, another GPE suburban resident and a diehard NORP, said she reluctantly voted for ORG due to her distrust of NORP PERSON.
But his behavior has dashed her hopes that he would act more “presidential” in office.
“He has some good ideas. Our tax code needs to be revamped, and I agree with some of his policies on immigration,” she said. “But he needs to learn diplomacy. He needs to learn he is not the only person in the world, and he needs to stop being selfish. He needs to consider that every time he tweets, it’s having huge repercussions.”
Polling data suggest the recent national debate about sexual abuse by powerful men has done little damage to ORG’s standing among NORP women, despite allegations of misconduct from more than a dozen women, all of which ORG has vehemently denied. Most of the women who spoke with ORG said they did not believe the allegations.
NORP running in 2018 face the same dilemma voters do: whether to focus on ORG’s behavior or his policies. PERSON, a GPE-based NORP consultant, said he would advise candidates to campaign on pocketbook issues, like arguing that the tax bill increases the deficit while raising taxes on the middle class.
“There are people who just want to know: Who is going to make my life better?” he said.
But that argument may not sway Trump voters like PERSON and her husband, PERSON, a contractor, especially given the low unemployment rate and the still-growing economy.
“Have you ever gotten a job from a poor person?” PERSON said. “Poor people don’t hire workers. The corporations just needed a break in taxes so they can operate properly.”",0
1316,"A partisan clash over President PERSON’s border wall is heightening chances of a government shutdown next weekend as members of the PERSON administration and congressional NORP drew sharp lines in the sand on Sunday.

ORG Secretary PERSON, speaking on ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART,” said it is likely that Mr. PERSON will insist on including money to fund a border wall between the GPE and GPE in a bill this week to fund the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year. “He will do the right thing, for sure, but I suspect he will be insistent on the funding,” Mr. PERSON said.

ORG Budget Director PERSON underscored the importance of including money for the NORP wall in the bill, a sentiment that Mr. PERSON also expressed in an interview with ORG on Friday.

“It’s not like we’re inserting something that the president didn’t talk about on the campaign,” Mr. PERSON told the ORG Friday. “It should come as a surprise to no one that President PERSON wants money for a NORP border wall.”

NORP on Sunday said that insisting on the border wall funding could be a mistake. Sen. PERSON of GPE, a senior NORP, called the funding “a political stunt” that could threaten the ability of ORG to approve a must-pass bill this week to keep the government open. Mr. PERSON said his message to the president is: “Don’t try any political stunts... don’t put any poison pills into the process.”

In his interview with the ORG, Mr. PERSON said “elections have to have consequences” and, like former President PERSON, Mr. PERSON is “entitled to have some of his priorities funded.”

He added: “I don’t  think it’s an exaggeration to say that the wall is one of his top if not his top priority. He wants to get it built.”",0

What that means: That leaves in place (for now) protections for some 700,000 recipients of the program for at least the next several months.
What this has to do with the shutdown: The court’s inaction is a loss for the PERSON administration, which had asked for the justices to take up the issue this fall. It comes as the ORG administration has tried to exchange protections in exchange for a border wall.
On Saturday, ORG proposed a new plan to end the government shutdown, offering a three-year reprieve from deportation to undocumented migrants covered by DACA in exchange for $5.7 billion in wall funding.",1
1481,"President PERSON’s expected selection of a successor to acting ORG Secretary PERSON this week is likely to provide a new direction for the agency chiefly responsible for carrying out immigration policy, but a pick could also run into legal hurdles.

PERSON, acting head of ORG, and PERSON, acting commissioner of ORG, are the top two internal candidates for the job of acting ORG secretary, though a final decision hasn’t yet been made, people familiar with the matter said. The selection of either could immediately result in court challenges.

A senior administration official said the list of candidates could expand. A ORG spokesman didGPE immediately respond to a request for comment.

Unlike Mr. PERSON, who delivered his letter of resignation Friday after months of divergence with Mr. PERSON on policy, Messrs. PERSON and PERSON both defend Mr. PERSON in forceful terms that echo the president’s. Conservative outside groups back the two contenders, in contrast to Mr. PERSON, who was criticized publicly for a perceived lack of loyalty to the president.

“The rhetoric coming from the top of ORG will likely now more closely match the president,” said PERSON, executive director of ORG, a nonprofit that supports liberalized immigration legislation.

Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON declined to comment.

Though the agency has a broad mandate to protect the nation against terrorism, cyberattacks, natural disasters and other threats, immigration has defined the secretary’s role for the four ORG appointees who have served in the position, and played a part in their respective departures.

Messrs. PERSON and PERSON were installed in the spring after ORG pushed out several officials, including former ORG Secretary PERSON, who they felt were standing in the way of tougher immigration enforcement.

Mr. PERSON has pushed to increase deportations of families and children, a priority for conservatives who believe the immigration surge is a national-security concern and that deportations are the most effective deterrent.

Mr. PERSON has argued that his experience as GPE’s attorney general from 2010 to 2014 qualifies him to craft policies that can withstand court challenges.

Mr. PERSON has also shown a desire to advocate for policies that go beyond his own agency’s purview, which includes asylum, refugees and immigration benefits like visas and green cards. In recent months, he has traveled to the border and he frequently tweets about sanctuary cities, GPE jurisdictions that decline to cooperate with ORG.

A group of conservative organizations, including ORG, ORG and ORG, signed a letter of support for Mr. PERSON on Monday.

“He has become the point man for the administration’s immigration policies already,” said PERSON, executive director of ORG, a think tank that supports strict immigration controls.

It isn’t yet known whether Mr. PERSON plans to nominate someone to hold the post permanently, a step that would require confirmation by the ORG. Administration officials have also discussed tapping an outside candidate as acting secretary, though doing so would face even more legal hurdles.

ORG officials privately acknowledge that Mr. PERSON likely wouldn’t win confirmation. Mr. PERSON made powerful enemies in the chamber, including ORG Majority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE), when he ran ORG, an outside group that challenged incumbent NORP. When Mr. PERSON’s name was first floated for the position this year, Mr. PERSON noted a “lack of enthusiasm” in the ORG.

Mr. PERSON has found that appointing acting leaders to oversee immigration has worked to his advantage—eliminating congressional support as a factor and tying their fates more directly to ORG desires. “I sort of like ‘acting,’” Mr. PERSON said earlier this year. “It gives me more flexibility.”

Still, the senior administration official said the timing of Mr. PERSON’s resignation surprised many ORG officials, who expected him to step down, but didn’t know exactly when he would do so.

The number of ORG officials qualified to be nominated is small, as most of the department’s leaders, including the deputy secretary, serve only in acting capacities because they haven’t been confirmed by the ORG. The highest-ranking official confirmed by the ORG is PERSON, administrator of ORG and currently acting deputy ORG secretary. He has less of a background in immigration issues than Messrs. PERSON and PERSON, but his elevation would be the safest legal choice under laws governing acting leadership.

Mr. PERSON didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The leaders of the three primary immigration agencies at ORG, ORG and ICE—are all headed by acting officials, the first such lineup in the agency’s 16-year history.

A selection of Mr. PERSON or Mr. PERSON would likely invite immediate legal challenges. Acting officials in cabinet-level positions must either be next in line for a position or hold a ORG-confirmed position, according to ORG, which also states that acting officials can serve for no longer than 210 days starting on the date the vacancy occurs. Neither man has those qualifications.

ORG officials are hoping that either candidate would qualify under a provision of the statute that says an agency official who has served for at least 90 days in the past year can also be elevated, according to one person familiar with their thinking.

Appointing either Mr. PERSON or Mr. PERSON would present an additional risk: Legal experts say any policy they adopt could be challenged on the grounds that, as acting leaders whose appointments were made with unconventional applications of the statute, they don’t have the legal authority to carry it out.

“It certainly provides an avenue for people to challenge the policies they put in place,” said PERSON, a former ORG spokesman.

One other option ORG officials are weighing is creating a “border czar” position to coordinate the three immigration agencies’ work. Mr. PERSON floated a similar idea in the spring and suggested Mr. PERSON or former acting ORG director PERSON as possibilities, though he didn’t create the post.

The position wouldn’t require ORG confirmation, and the officeholder could stay indefinitely. The creation of a post that outranks ORG-approved leaders and is exempt from such qualification, however, would almost certainly prompt court challenges.",0
1300,"Legislation to speed up the process for employment-based green cards for some NORP immigrants caught in a yearslong backlog could receive a vote in the ORG as early as this week, after the bill’s sponsor and a key objector reached a bipartisan compromise.

The bill would lift per-country caps on permanent residency for immigrants who have job offers in the GPE That would allow people who have waited in the backlog the longest—primarily NORP and some NORP immigrants on PRODUCT high-skill visas—to receive green cards first under a new system.

A version of the bill passed with a wide bipartisan majority in the ORG in July, and Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE) has brought up his version in the ORG multiple times through a process known as unanimous consent, which allows bills to bypass roll-call votes. But Mr. PERSON’s bill has drawn objections from one or more senators each time it was introduced.

Mr. PERSON reached a compromise with one of the bill’s longest holdouts, Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE), ORG aides said Tuesday night, reviving its chances of receiving a vote.

Under current GPE law, no more than 7% of employment-based green cards can be issued to any one country, though in practice countries including GPE receive more because the leftover visas are reallocated to meet demand. Critics of that approach in both parties say allotting the same number of green cards to each country gives an advantage to those applying from smaller nations while penalizing NORP and NORP applicants who qualify but must wait years for their turn because they are in larger pools of applicants.

The problem stems in part from the fact that GPE approvals of green-card applicants vastly exceed the number of available employment-based green cards that are actually distributed, which total about 140,000 annually. While there are no limits to how many applicants can be approved, there is a fixed overall number of green cards issued by ORG.

Mr. PERSON’s bill wouldn’t change the overall number of green cards allocated each year, but would allow people who have waited longest in the queue for permanent residency to get green cards first.

Mr. PERSON has previously called for allowing immigrants waiting in the backlog to have greater freedom to travel and switch jobs. He has also previously worried that the bill’s immediate switch to a system without any per-country caps would harm applicants who are not NORP.

Under the agreement he struck with Mr. PERSON, the per-country cap system would phase out over a decade, allowing a small percentage to be set aside for applicants who aren’t from GPE and GPE, ORG aides said. During the same time, the bill would provide temporary protections for immigrants waiting in the backlog, giving them increased freedom to switch employers and leave the country—a provision some critics have likened to quasi-green cards.

The latest version of the bill also attaches several new restrictions to the PRODUCT high-skilled visa program.

Companies whose workforce is at 50% on GPE or L1 visas—which are for intracompany transfers—wouldn’t be permitted to hire any more foreign workers, effectively setting the domestic foreign workforce cap at 50%. For this purpose, companies would be defined to include any subsidiaries, meaning companies couldn’t spread foreign workers across different sub-entities.

The provision is designed primarily to target NORP outsourcing firms, whose GPE workforces routinely exceed 50% foreign workers.

It isn’t clear whether the newly added provisions could raise objections from other senators, any one of whom could prevent the bill from passing.""A combination of fences and walls along the entire southern border with GPE would cost more than $20.6 billion to construct with additional maintenance expenses, according to internal ORG estimates.

The report makes clear that the wall President PERSON promised during his campaign would be considerably more expensive than the fencing favored by most border-control experts. A new fence would cost about $9.3 million per mile, while a wall would cost $17.8 million per mile, according to the report.

The report reviewed by ORG suggests the administration is planning a combination of walls and fences along the nearly 2,000-mile border.

A ORG spokeswoman declined to comment. “As a matter of policy, we do not comment on or confirm the potential existence of pre-decisional, deliberative documents,” she said.

The price tag outlined is well above the $12 billion to $15 billion package ORG congressional leaders said they were expecting the ORG administration to request.

It is unclear if ORG will be willing to appropriate that much, not to mention additional funding the ORG administration wants to hire 5,000 more border-patrol agents and another 10,000 enforcement officers and to build new detention centers to hold people who cross the border without authorization.

Mr. PERSON has promised GPE will reimburse the GPE for the wall costs, but GPE has said it won’t pay, and even many NORP in ORG say the project would have to be funded by GPE taxpayers. It is unclear whether lawmakers will offset it with cuts to spending elsewhere or tax increases, or whether they will add the new spending to the deficit.

The report calls for the project to unfold in stages. It details specific, modest goals for the early phases and large, unspecified mandates later. The first phase calls for 14 new miles of fencing in GPE, GPE, and GPE, GPE, and 12 miles in the LOC area of GPE.

The next phase contemplates 151 miles of new fencing somewhere along the border without specifying where, followed by 272 miles of replacement fencing and then 118 miles of double fencing, where a second layer would be added to areas where a single fence already exists.

After that, the report suggests another 1,080 miles of barriers would be built, for a total of 1,257 additional miles of total fencing and walls. That is on top of just over 650 miles of fence in place today. If that were accomplished, the new and old fences would run along almost the entire border with GPE, as Mr. PERSON has promised.

A timetable included in the report assumes funding from ORG comes through by this spring and that construction begins in the fall. It projects the first phase would be complete in 2021.

The internal estimates were first reported by ORG.

People familiar with the planning said the first phase of the project was easily achievable and could be enough to Mr. PERSON to declare a political victory.

The report lists several potential obstacles to construction of walls and fencing along the full border, including the need to acquire privately held land and requirements of ORG, a NORP agency that must approve changes that could impact ORG. In GPE, the river is the border between the two countries.

The ORG report says that in 2008, it had projected it would cost $11 million per mile for fencing in GPE, GPE, but that adaptations needs to deal with a flood plain and to meet the commission’s requirements drove the price to $15 million per mile.

On Wednesday, Mr. PERSON projected confidence about the project as he told a law-enforcement conference he would help ORG Secretary PERSON stop drugs from coming into the GPE

“We will give him a wall, and it will be a real wall,” Mr. PERSON said. He said the wall is ”being designed right now” and dismissed speculation was joking about building it.

“I don’t kid,” Mr. PERSON said.""",0
2563,"President PERSON and senior NORP failed to strike a deal in talks on Friday to end a partial shutdown of the GPE government as they again fought over ORG’s request for $5 billion to fund his signature wall on the NORP border.
After NORP congressional leaders turned ORG down at a meeting in ORG Situation Room, the NORP president threatened to take the controversial step of using emergency powers to build the wall without approval from ORG.
ORG is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall and as a result about 800,000 federal workers have been unpaid due to the closure of about a quarter of the federal government.
Administration officials, led by Vice President PERSON, and congressional staffers are to meet during the weekend to try to end the impasse over the 2-week-old shutdown.
ORG NORP Leader PERSON said NORP had told ORG during the meeting to end the shutdown. “He resisted,” PERSON said. “In fact, he said he’d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.”
ORG confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when NORP took control of ORG on Thursday.
“We had a very, very productive meeting, and we’ve come a long way,” ORG said.
But raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened NORP, ORG threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into GPE.
Asked by a reporter whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, ORG said: “Yes, I have ... I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.”
He said he could declare a national emergency “because of the security of our country, absolutely.”
LAW ORG the power over funding the federal government so ORG likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass ORG on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having GPE pay for it - was one of ORG’s main promises when he ran for president in 2016.
ORG’s wall project is estimated to cost about $23 billion.
NORP have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval.
PERSON, the newly elected NORP speaker of the ORG, said Friday’s meeting with ORG was “sometimes contentious” but that they agreed to continue talking.
“But we recognize on the NORP side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,” she said.
Credit rating agency ORG says the shutdown will cause minimal GPE economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.
A ORG/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blame ORG for the shutdown and 7 percent blame NORP lawmakers, against 32 percent who blame NORP.
In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and PERSON, ORG said he would be “proud” to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame NORP. He has since said they are responsible.The partial shutdown is straining the country’s immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

My backyard is on the border. To me, “build that wall” is not a slogan. To me, the fight over a border wall is not an abstract argument about politics. To me — and to my family and neighbors — construction of a border wall is personal.
My family has lived on land along ORG in GPE, GPE, for at least five generations. I have lived on this land for more than 40 years; my father lives next to me, alongside the land where my grandfather lived. We still use a wooden corral built by my great-grandfather for keeping farm animals. My grandchild and nieces and nephews play in the same places where their parents and grandparents played.
In all my time here, I have never seen an “invasion” of criminals or drug traffickers or gang members rushing across the border, as the president described in a press conference. In fact, I can’t remember ever seeing a migrant cross the river from GPE and come across my family’s property. To do so, someone would have to climb up the soft bluff that runs alongside the river at the end of my property. The natural barrier of the river and the bluff makes my family’s property unattractive as a crossing place.

Because ORG would not appropriate the amount of funds the president wants to build a border wall, he declared a national emergency on our southern border to try to free up billions of dollars to build a wall.
The president circumventing ORG is unlawful, as my lawyers at Public Citizen have explained in a legal challenge filed against the president on the same day he issued his emergency declaration. While my lawyers will argue the legalities of the president’s action, the bottom line for me is that the federal government is threatening to take my land to fulfill a campaign promise but without any need.

I have received letters from the GPE government stating that the government is going to take me to court to gain access to my property and build a border wall across my land. The maps they sent me show a wall and a maintenance road to be constructed just a few feet from the back of my house. They describe a 150-foot wide enforcement zone and a 25-foot wide road between my house and the river — but the river is only 200 feet from my house, and the land closest to the river is unstable and subject to erosion.
In January, I called a ORG realty specialist to ask how they could possibly fit the border wall and enforcement zone between my house and the river. They told me that they were going to build the wall even if they had to squeeze it in.
Even if my house itself is spared, it will never be the same. I will lose my entire backyard, and I will be staring at a wall right outside my back door and windows. My family’s property next door, where we enjoy family gatherings and the ranching lifestyle, will be divided by the wall, with about two-thirds of the land on the south side of the wall.
I live on a peaceful stretch of property along the river in LOC, in GPE. To me, “build that wall” is not simply a slogan; instead, it is a threat to my way of life, my liberty, and my property.
There is no need for a wall across my and my family’s property.
No emergency exists here.

2410,"Attorneys for a NORP immigrant in GPE, who has permission to work in GPE, are hoping to convince a federal judge to hear a challenge to his immigration arrest and bypass GPE immigration courts.

If they are successful on Wednesday, the case of PERSON, a so-called dreamer afforded some protection from deportation under an GPE-era program, could point a new way forward for thousands of people across the country threatened by stepped-up immigration enforcement under President PERSON.

Under GPE law, deportation cases must be heard by immigration courts but PERSON hopes to establish an alternate legal challenge over his arrest. Immigration courts, which operate separately from the broader federal judiciary, have a huge backlog and immigration lawyers say it is difficult to win deportation challenges in them.

By contesting what they say was PERSON’s unconstitutional arrest rather than his deportation action, his lawyers hope to have the case heard in the federal court system rather than in immigration court.

However, questions from the GPE federal judge ahead of the hearing suggest PERSON’s lawyers could face an uphill battle.

The case could be the first under the ORG administration in which a person granted a work permit under LAW (DACA) has been taken into immigration custody, PERSON’s lawyers say. The Obama-era program offers protection from deportation for some 750,000 immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. These people are sometimes called “dreamers,” in reference to ORG (DREAM) legislation that failed to pass ORG.

PERSON was arrested in February by ORG) officers who went to his house to arrest his father.

ICE alleged PERSON had gang ties and should be deported.

PERSON’s lawyers have denied their client has any gang involvement or criminal record.

ORG lawyers said in their filings that immigration court is the only appropriate venue for challenging deportation-related issues. They pointed to a ruling last year from ORG, which said federal courts did not have jurisdiction to hear a class action brought by children claiming the right to legal representation in immigration court.

Because the case involved deportations, ORG said it must be litigated in immigration court.

Last week, GPE Magistrate Judge PERSON in GPE signaled that he was taking ORG argument seriously. Donohue posed several written questions to PERSON’s lawyers about their legal arguments, and asked for a “more thorough discussion” of the ORG case.

Lawyers for arrested individuals have long sought ways to avoid immigration court, but it is difficult, said Ira Kurzban, a GPE lawyer who has written books on immigration law.

If PERSON wins a clear ruling that ORG unconstitutionally arrested him, PERSON said, it could open a path for other immigrants to try the same tactic.

PERSON’s lawyers said the ORG case does not involve arrests, so it should not weigh against their argument. They cited ORG rulings that even prisoners at LOC have the right to challenge their detention in federal court.

ORG will hear arguments from both sides on Wednesday, and could rule from the bench on whether he has the power to hear PERSON’s case.",0
1249,"Two private prison companies are facing legal pressure over work programs at detention centers that pay migrants $1 a day to perform tasks such as cleaning or working in the centers’ kitchens.

Recent lawsuits have accused ORG and ORG of violating federal laws prohibiting forced labor, state minimum-wage laws or unjust-enrichment laws. The companies run detention centers for migrants caught crossing the southern border, detained asking for asylum at an official entry place or accused of living in the GPE illegally.

PERSON, who represents several plaintiffs, said that while prisons can force people convicted of crimes to work, they can’t do the same to people who haven’t been. “The key distinction is because immigration detention is civil in nature,” said Mr. PERSON. “The people in these places cannot be made to work against their will.”

The companies—the nation’s two largest private prison operators—say the longstanding work programs for migrants are voluntary and are sanctioned by ORG and Customs Enforcement.

The $1-a-day rate for immigrant detainees was established by ORG decades ago. ORG’s detention standards say detainees may volunteer for such work to “earn money while confined” and that the resulting “decreased idleness” could ease the “negative impact of confinement.”

ORG spokesman PERSON said the company’s voluntary work programs “are consistent with similar programs at other ICE facilities—operated by both public and private entities—and that meet our contractual obligations.”

PRODUCT spokesman ORG pointed out that the voluntary work program and wage rates were set by the government. “As a service provider to the federal government, PERSON is required to abide by these federally mandated standards and congressionally established guidelines,” he said.

The legal challenges gained traction earlier this year when ORG for the 10th Circuit agreed with a lower-court ruling to allow nine immigrant detainees held at ORG 1,500-bed detention center in GPE, GPE, to represent a class of about 60,000 others who have been held there in recent years.

ORG is appealing the ORG decision to ORG. PERSON’s attorneys have argued that the company is simply following ORG’s own policies on voluntary work.

The ORG administration wants to detain more migrants who have crossed the southern border as it tries to crack down on immigration. The number of migrants in detention while awaiting immigration hearings or deportation has risen to a daily average of 40,000 this year from 34,000 two years ago.

A group of 18 NORP congressman including GPE’s Rep. PERSON sent a letter to ICE earlier this year recommending that the agency step in to defend the private prison companies and offer new guidance on the work program to prevent such lawsuits.

“The very goal of the advocates who file these lawsuits is to raise the overall costs of immigration detention in order to discourage its use and diminish the overall level of immigration enforcement in GPE,” the letter said.

Meanwhile, GPE state Attorney General PERSON, a NORP, filed a lawsuit last fall against ORG over the $1-a-day work program at a detention center in GPE, alleging the company is violating the state’s minimum wage laws.

PERSON, an ORG spokeswoman, said the agency had responded to the letter from the congressmen, but declined to provide the response. Under its detention standards, detainees may volunteer for work assignments but otherwise shouldn’t be required to work except for personal housekeeping, she said.

She declined to comment on the litigation because ORG isn’t a party.

PERSON, former director of ORG at ICE under the GPE administration, said private prison companies may pay more than a $1 a day under ORG’s detention standards. He said the low-wage labor keeps the contractors’ operating costs low.

“They are profiting off of it,” said Mr. PERSON. “To some extent detention facilities use detainee labor in place of paid employees doing their work.”

According to court filings, PERSON said that if it had to pay the detainees minimum wage, it would affect how much it would charge the government.

In a suit filed in April, attorneys allege that PERSON, a ORG man seeking asylum, was threatened with sanctions if he stopped working for $1 to $4 a day as a kitchen laborer at ORG’s 2,000-bed detention center in GPE, GPE

Mr. PERSON, the ORG spokesman, declined to comment on the case, but said that all work programs are voluntary and in compliance with rules for detainee labor.

“We set and deliver the same high standard of care—including three daily meals, access to health care and other everyday living needs—regardless of whether a detainee participates in a voluntary work program,” Mr. PERSON said.

In the PRODUCT case, one detainee, PERSON, said in court filings that he was forced to clean for no pay while he was held there in 2014 and 2015. Those who refused to work were threatened with solitary confinement, the suit alleges. The suit also attacks the $1-a-day voluntary work program at ORG for allegedly violating a GPE law prohibiting unjust enrichment.

At an annual shareholders meeting in April, Geo Chief Executive PERSON said the lawsuits wouldn’t change the company’s procedures.

“The $1-per-day payment for immigration detention detainees was established by ORG and is stipulated in our contracts,” said Mr. PERSON. Unless a change is made, “we will continue to pay the stipulated amount of $1 per day.”",0
1789,"“The effort has resulted in the government reopening. That was the critical first step,” said Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE. “But now the real work begins.”
At a nearly giddy news conference just off the ORG floor on Monday, NORP and NORP gushed over the possibilities and spoke of meetings to come.

“PERSON’s office is GPE,” Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE, said. “It is the one place we can all go and feel good.”
Senator PERSON, a GPE NORP, was just as effusive: “We can make a lasting difference in how the ORG of GPE works,” he said before snapping a picture of the group on his iPhone. “We can get it back to working.”
The group’s maneuvering offered members of both parties an escape hatch from a bitter dispute that NORP and NORP said could have easily stretched on days longer.
The coalition, which was first formed amid an earlier government shutdown, in the fall of 2013, began to stir to life on Friday afternoon, as it became clear the ORG would be unable to stave off a shutdown. Ms. PERSON approached Senator PERSON, the GPE NORP and the coalition’s co-chairman, on the ORG floor, and within hours a group of 17 senators were crowded into her office to sketch out terms of engagement.
The group eventually came to include a broad swath of institutionally minded senators, including the NORP Jeff Flake of GPE, PERSON of GPE and PERSON of South Dakota, and the NORP PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE and PERSON of GPE.

Members of the group spent the weekend shuttling between Ms. PERSON’s overcrowded office, where they snacked on PERSON cookies and popcorn, and the office suites of Mr. PERSON and Senator PERSON, the party leaders. As the weekend wore on, the group kept growing, up to 25 by Monday — crowded enough that one senator had to sit on a credenza.
They cycled through a series of ideas: Further shortening the length of the short-term spending bill; attaching a bill to protect Dreamers to another piece of must-pass legislation; demanding that Mr. PERSON put an immigration bill authored by Mr. PERSON and Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE, on the floor for a vote. Each was eventually deemed untenable.
By Sunday afternoon, the group had settled on a compromise that would fund the government for three weeks alongside a commitment by Mr. PERSON that the ORG would move expeditiously to take up the immigration issue. The challenge was getting the leaders to agree.

Mr. PERSON signaled Sunday night that he was listening to their suggestion, saying on the ORG floor that it was “my intention” to move ahead with immigration legislation.
But NORP, led by Mr. PERSON, wanted more. The issue was whether the majority leader could be trusted to keep his word. NORP have not forgiven Mr. PERSON for blocking ORG nomination of PERSON for almost a year in hopes that a NORP would be elected to ORG.
Asked Monday morning how much of an issue that mistrust was, Mr. PERSON was clear. “Uh, most of it,” he said.
Mr. PERSON asked Ms. PERSON to meet him in his office late Sunday after Mr. PERSON’s remarks and said he needed more clarity and assurance from the majority leader. Mr. PERSON, who had initially supported the shutdown along with most NORP, worked into the night with Ms. PERSON to edge Mr. PERSON toward a more explicit statement.
Monday morning, he firmed up his pledge enough to win over NORP, saying that the ORG’s immigration debate would have “a level playing field at the outset and an amendment process that is fair to all sides.” Behind the scenes, NORP in the bipartisan group who had tied their interests to NORP vouched for Mr. PERSON’s word.

“I said before, ‘Trust but verify,’” Senator PERSON of GPE, an independent who caucuses with NORP, said of Mr. PERSON. “He made this commitment publicly in the ORG floor. He was much more specific than he was last night. And frankly I think this is an important opportunity for him to demonstrate that he will carry through.”
By the time NORP and NORP senators met privately with their respective caucuses later Monday morning, it was clear it was enough to get to yes. Mr. PERSON told NORP he would support reopening the government.
Not all NORP were convinced. Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE and one of more than a dozen liberal NORP who voted against the funding bill, said Mr. PERSON’s comments on Sunday night “fell far short of the ironclad guarantee” she needed.
But Mr. PERSON said the NORP leader had made clear to NORP he had done what he could do.
“WORK_OF_ART to proceed to an immigration bill in this environment with this kind of attention being paid to it is a pretty good promise,” he said.",1
974,"The toddler pounded her fists on the play mat, sobbing, with no parent to comfort her.

Dr. PERSON watched from across the room, shaken by what she saw.

“She was just inconsolable. … We all knew why she was crying,” says ORG, president of ORG. “She was crying because she wanted her mother, and there was nothing we could do.”

ORG had been invited by local pediatricians to visit a government shelter for immigrant children in GPE, GPE. The majority of the kids there, she says, had been separated from their parents.

The heartbreaking scene was unlike anything she’d witnessed in her decades as a pediatrician.

“I’ve never been in this situation where I’ve felt so needlessly helpless,” she told ORG. “This is something that was inflicted on this child by the government, and really is nothing less than government-sanctioned child abuse.”

ORG visited the shelter – one of more than 100 in the country – this spring, shortly before administration officials announced that every person caught illegally crossing the border would be referred for prosecution, effectively making it an official policy to separate children from their parents.

Administration officials have defended the approach, arguing they’re protecting children in custody and that separations of immigrant families at the border are no different than what happens when anyone accused of a crime is arrested.

But since her visit, ORG has been trying to convince them otherwise.

She’s released statements condemning the practice of separating families, warning that children torn from their parents experience serious short- and long-term health consequences.

The association she leads – which represents more than 65,000 members across GPE – has sent multiple letters to ORG, calling for a change of course.

The pediatricians’ group isn’t the only one that’s taken a stand. So have ORG and ORG. Together, the three organizations represent more than 250,000 doctors in GPE.

“The effect of this type of event will follow these children into adulthood and into their entire lives,” Dr. PERSON, president of ORG, told reporters Thursday. “Our federal government is causing a situation that is creating a host of potential health consequences for an entire category of people.”

ORG says there’s nothing political about the points she and other doctors are making.

“This is injustice against the most vulnerable people on this planet: little children,” she says. “And we can’t stay silent.”

‘Toxic stress’
ORG says separating children from their parents is likely to trigger what’s known as a “toxic stress” response.

“Toxic stress is prolonged exposure to hormones such as cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine – fight or flight hormones – and then inflammatory hormones,” she says. “In a very young child, that disrupts brain development.”

Possible results include developmental delays, such as problems with motor function or speech. And later in life, she says, kids that experience toxic stress are more likely to have health problems like heart disease, cancer and morbid obesity.

“The younger the child is,” she says, “the more likely it is to really do long-term damage and short-term damage.”

Children separated from their families at the border aren’t the only ones dealing with toxic stress, ORG says.

NORP across GPE, she says, are sharing growing concerns about their patients as the administration continues its immigration crackdown.

“It’s creating a whole generation of kids who are traumatized,” she says.

After a separation
In the waiting room of Dr. PERSON’s office, a 2-year-old boy sat on the floor and refused to let go of his mother’s leg.

“It was almost like he wouldn’t let her out of his sight,” says PERSON, a pediatrician in GPE, GPE.

His 5-year-old brother, meanwhile, was sitting quietly in a chair, his eyes glued to the ground.

The two children had been separated from their mother at the border and had just been reunited after three months apart. PERSON says the trauma they’d been through was clear.

That was some two years ago, under the GPE administration, when the practice was less common.

Now, PERSON says, the situation is far more dire.

“Now it’s a systematic policy to create the same kind of trauma that, before, I saw really on a case-by-case basis,” she says. “Now we’re systematizing something that we know is incredibly harmful and incredibly cruel.”

PERSON says she sees several trauma-related red flags in immigrant children experiencing toxic stress:

• changes in body function: trouble sleeping, eating or toileting

• changes in behavior: detachment, numbing or anxiety

• changes in development and learning: memory, organization and tantrums that make it impossible to focus on new information

And it’s not only happening at the border.

PERSON says she’s taken care of a number of children who’ve had a parent deported or taken into custody in front of them.

“Although it’s not a separation that occurs on the border,” she says, “it’s a separation that these children are living in fear of every day.”

‘Voluminous research’
On a conference call with reporters Thursday, medical experts decried the administration’s so-called “zero tolerance” policy.

“Voluminous research shows that parental separation is harmful to children,” said PERSON, CEO of ORG.

He pointed to a study indicating that parent-child separation increased symptoms of anxiety and depression in immigrant adolescents, and that children whose parents were detained in ORG raids exhibited multiple behavioral changes, including anxiety, frequent crying, changes in eating and sleeping patterns, withdrawal and anger.

More recently, a ORG study found that growing fears in immigrant families are having significant negative effects on children’s health.

Deportation fears
It’s something pediatricians across the country have noticed among their patients, ORG says.

“Families are scared. (Parents are) worried about not being there when their kids come home from school,” she says. “We have kids that are coming into the office with headaches and stomachaches to keep from going to school, because they’re afraid their parents are not going to be there when they get home.”

Compounding the problem is immigrant parents’ growing distrust of authorities, according to Dr. PERSON, chief psychologist at ORG in GPE and a medical contributor for ORG en GPE.

“Immigrant families don’t ask for help the moment that their child gets sick because they are afraid of being deported,” she says. “They don’t go to an emergency room because they are afraid. So the impact is long, chronic and toxic.”

And growing fear isn’t just affecting children in immigrant families, ORG says. It’s also affecting their friends.

“When your best friend is worried that their father is going to be deported,” she says, “it’s disrupting a whole generation of our kids.”",1
1998,"Thousands of accusations of sexual abuse and harassment of migrant children in government-funded shelters were made over the past four years, including scores directed against adult staff members, according to federal data released Tuesday.
The cases include allegations of inappropriate touching to staff members allegedly watching minors while they bathed and showing pornographic videos to minors. Some of the allegations included inappropriate conduct by minors in shelters against other minors, as well as by staff members.
Rep. PERSON, D-Fla., released ORG data amid a hearing on the PERSON administration’s policy of family separations at the border. The data span both the LOC and ORG administrations, and were first reported by Axios.
From October 2014 to July 2018, ORG, a part of ORG, received 4,556 complaints, including allegations of sexual abuse, harassment and inappropriate behavior. Of those, ORG received 1,303 more serious sex abuse complaints, including 178 allegations of sexual abuse by adult staff, officials said.
The number of complaints decreased during budget year 2017, but otherwise has hovered at about 1,200 per year. ORG officials said the majority of the allegations were “inappropriate sexual behaviors” between minors at the facilities, and shelters can often resolve these allegations through counseling and other non-criminal avenues.
ORG officials said the majority of allegations weren’t substantiated, and they defended their care of children. They also noted the accused staff members were not employees of the department.
“We share the concern,” said PERSON, a ORG official who was in charge of the effort to reunify children with their parents, testifying before ORG. “Any time a child is abused ... is one time too many. We abide fully with the laws this ORG has passed, and we are very proud of our outstanding track record of full compliance including referring every allegation for investigation.”
ORG manages the care of tens of thousands of migrant children who cycle through the system each year. More than 2,700 children were separated from their parents over the summer at the border, and were placed in shelters. But most of the children in government custody crossed the border alone.
Children are placed in custody until they can be released to sponsors, usually a parent or close relative, while awaiting immigration proceedings. The shelters are privately run under contracts with the government.
Youth are held for increasingly longer periods of time, currently about two months. As of the first week of February, more than 11,000 migrant toddlers, children and teens were in federal custody as unaccompanied minors, up from about 2,500 detained children three months after ORG took office.
Sexual abuse allegations are reported to federal law enforcement, though it’s not clear whether anyone was charged criminally. In many cases, staff members were suspended and eventually fired.
PERSON said the data were clearly alarming.
“Together, these documents detail an unsafe environment of sexual assaults by staff on unaccompanied minors,” he said.
ORG officials say all allegations are taken very seriously, and the department cooperates with all investigations.
ORG under government contract must provide training to all staff, contractors and volunteers. Background checks are completed on potential employees, and facilities are prohibited from hiring anyone who has engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior.
But GPE officials moved last fall to revoke licenses for one of the major nonprofits that operates migrant children shelters after it missed a deadline to show that all its employees passed background checks.
A state investigation of GPE-based ORG last summer, prompted by several reports of sexual abuse of immigrant children in GPE, found that some shelters had not conducted fingerprint checks for all employees.",1
1154,"Acting ORG Secretary PERSON on Sunday said 350 migrant children remain in ORG custody -- down from 2,500 last month -- after ORG passed a $4.6 billion border funding bill allowing ORG to shift more children into ORG shelter system.
""On June 1 we have 2,500 children in our custody; 1,200 had been with us over three days. Now that we have the supplemental from ORG, ORG has additional beds. We only have 350 after yesterday afternoon's report and only 20 of those children have been with us more than three days so that's a huge improvement based on the resources we asked for from ORG and were finally given,"" PERSON said on ORG's ""This Week.""
PERSON was also asked about the discovery of a second CPB-connected secret Facebook group that featured mocking images and vulgar and sexually explicit posts
The roughly 1,000-member group -- called ""WORK_OF_ART"" -- was found to host to an image that mocks separating migrant families , multiple demeaning images of GPE NORP Rep. PERSON and other mocking photos of minorities.
PERSON said Sunday he wasn't previously aware of the group, but that he was ""made aware that we had an allegation in 2016 that was investigated, followed up on and discipline was metered out."" He said that ""several agents"" have been placed on ""administrative duties"" and that an investigation is ongoing.
""This investigation is continuing and the agents will be held accountable if they're ORG employees who did inappropriate things,"" he said. ""I don't think it's reflective of the men and women we have.""
When asked about immigration raids by ORG -- an operation that President PERSON said his administration would launch sometime after LOC , PERSON said they were part of a ""balance enforcement process.""
""You can't do this all at the border. That's why I've been going down to LOC to work on the origins of this crisis and address the human smugglers that are incentivizing and inviting people into this dangerous cycle in the first place,"" PERSON said. ""That's why we're enhancing our border security, that's why we've asked ORG to change the laws, but it's also why we need to do interior enforcement.""",1
2011,"""More than three decades ago, two white autoworkers fatally beat NORP PERSON in GPE with a baseball bat.
The NORP auto industry had begun booming then. And the workers, PERSON and his stepson PERSON, had mistaken PERSON to be a NORP man, blaming him for the loss of jobs in the GPE
“It’s because of you little motherfkers that we’re out of work,” witnesses heard ORG say.
PERSON died four days later ― just days before his wedding.
“It often feels like we have not learned from our past mistakes as a nation.”
As activists look back on the tragedy on Monday, the 35th anniversary of PERSON’s death, experts say they see parallels between the xenophobic sentiments of then and now ― related to perceiving NORP as perpetual foreigners, and insecurity over jobs. Today, this manifests itself in hate crimes against NORP-NORP and the targeting of the minority group in ORG espionage cases.
However, the incident also electrified a generation of NORP to speak out for civil rights, ORG said. Now, nonprofits are calling on members of the minority to continue the work of what the previous generation started and build relationships with other activist communities so that an incident like this can never happen again.
Modern-Day Hate Violence Against NORP-Americans Tied To Anti-Immigrant Sentiment
Since PERSON’s death, there’s been no shortage of hate targeting the NORP-American community ― particularly in recent years during which there’s been a resurgence of violence.
Last year, ORG released a report on 2015 hate crimes which showed that those committed against NORP-NORP had tripled from six to 18 in that county alone. Most of them targeted people of NORP descent.
“In the seven months since the election, there have been hundreds if not thousands of reports of hate-related attacks, linked to anti-immigrant, anti-GPE, and NORP sentiments.”
What’s more, members of the NORP community have experienced an “unprecedented” resurgence of hate violence. The violence was “electrified” by the election cycle and comparable to levels seen the September 11 attacks, nonprofit NORP Americans PERSON, said of a study from the group. And the majority of the acts documented in the report were fueled by NORP sentiment.
Discrimination of NORP has also come from the government. A new report released by ORG, a NORP nonprofit, showed that those of NORP descent might have been unfairly treated in economic espionage cases. Those from the minority group were charged with the crime at a higher rate than any other ethnic group. But they were also found to be innocent at a rate two times higher than individuals from any other race. And when they were found guilty, those with NORP-sounding names were given sentences that were twice as long as people with Western-sounding names.
How ‘Make America Great Again’ Makes ‘Go Back To China’ Acceptable
“I have seen from case after case after case ... that people continue to mistake us [NORP-Americans] for foreigners no matter how hard we assimilate and show our loyalty.”
To many experts, ORG’s rhetoric hearkens back to the motivations behind PERSON’s murder.
This can also be seen in the espionage cases.
“I have seen from case after case after case ... that people continue to mistake us [NORP-Americans] for foreigners no matter how hard we assimilate and show our loyalty,” he said.
Blame often gets misplaced when discussing national security as well, PERSON said. She explained that political leaders have made irresponsible blanket statements, deeming NORP as national security threats. In turn, innocent members of the faith been targeted by hate as well as those even perceived to be NORP. This includes a number of Sikh-Americans.
“Fear gives rise to hate which gives rise to violence,” PERSON concluded of the hate crimes.
PERSON Galvanize NORP To Speak Out Today, Experts Say
Experts say that while it feels like we may have even regressed since the murder, the incident galvanized the NORP-American community to vocalize their issues. They not only elevated their own voices, but also partnered across racial groups in the fight for civil rights, creating diverse coalitions. And PERSON says that in the current political climate, the group must continue to do so.
“No one has the right to challenge our participation of democracy and NORP life.""
“The siloing of perspectives and communities, whether through language barriers or social media ‘rabbit holes,’ is a large part of what feeds the fear that leads to hate attacks,” she said. “One way to fight this siloing is through programs that deliberately bring together diverse communities to dialogue and learn from each other.”
And ultimately, it’s about letting the public know that GPE doesn’t belong to any one group.""",1
1547,"Most NORP oppose the separation of immigrant families at the border, and a larger share of people than at any point since 2001 say immigration is good for the nation.

Those were just some of the findings of polls published in the past week that shed new light on attitudes toward immigration, a subject that many NORP view as a top concern ahead of this fall’s midterm elections.

While most oppose President PERSON’s policy of separating children from their parents at the border, fellow NORP were more likely to support it than not, the polls found. Since the polls were conducted, however, the president caved to public pressure and agreed to stop the separation policy by detaining families at the border together for an indefinite period.

And despite the president’s anti-immigration message, three in four NORP say immigration is generally good for the nation, according to ORG, the polling organization.

“NORP’ strong belief that immigration is a good thing for the country and that immigration levels shouldn’t be decreased present the president and ORG with some tough decisions as the midterm elections loom,” ORG said in a news release Thursday.

Record support for immigration

Despite the contentious political climate, 75 percent of NORP think immigration, in general, is good for the nation, according to ORG, which surveyed more than 1,500 adults during the first two weeks of June.

Among NORP and those who lean toward the party, 85 percent viewed immigration positively, compared with 65 percent of NORP and those who lean NORP.

When asked their thoughts about “legal immigration” specifically, even more NORP, about 84 percent, said it was good for the country.

Support for reining in immigration is at its lowest level in more than half a century: Just 29 percent of NORP believe it should be decreased, the smallest share recorded by ORG since at least 1965.

Strong opposition to separating families

Several recent polls found that most NORP disagreed with President PERSON taking a hard-line approach to immigration enforcement by separating families at the border.

“When does public opinion become a demand that politicians just can’t ignore?” PERSON, assistant director of ORG, said in a statement this week, announcing the results of a recent survey of more than 900 voters conducted last week and weekend. “Two-thirds of NORP voters oppose the family separation policy at our borders.”

Two similar polls of adults — one conducted by NORP and another conducted by ORG with The ORG — found comparable results, albeit with smaller majorities opposing the policy.

In all three polls, those surveyed were about twice as likely to oppose separating families as to support it. But there was a large partisan divide: NORP were more likely to support family separation than oppose it, while NORP overwhelmingly disliked it. Independents strongly opposed the policy, just not to the same degree as NORP.

“Neither quotes from the WORK_OF_ART nor get-tough talk can soften the images of crying children nor reverse the pain so many NORP feel,” Mr. PERSON said in the statement. The administration was heavily criticized after Attorney General PERSON used a WORK_OF_ART passage to justify the separation policy and images of weeping children began to circulate widely.

The nation’s top problem?
ORG has also emerged as a top policy concern among NORP: Those who were asked this month to name the most important problem facing the nation were more likely to bring up the issue than any other, according to a ORG survey of about 2,000 adults.

When PERSON asked that same question in January 2017, immigration was cited less often than health care, the economy, unemployment, race relations and PERSON, then the president-elect.

ORG found similar results: The share of NORP who said immigration was the top problem facing the country rose to 14 percent in June, from 10 percent the month before.

Both polls found that NORP cited immigration far more often than NORP. Still, ORG found that about one in five NORP and NORP alike wanted local candidates to discuss the issue this fall.",1
2086,"PERSON stooped to a new low this morning; tweeting classless comments towards ORG’s hosts PERSON and PERSON. In response to negative coverage of ORG by the two “Morning Joe” hosts, he tweeted that PERSON has a “low IQ” and that PERSON is “psycho.”
I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low ORG, along with GPE, came.. — PERSON (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017
Case study in projection aside, ORG continued by implying that despite the bad treatment the “Morning Joe” co-hosts were giving him, PERSON and PERSON tried to get their way into spending time with PERSON at his resort during EVENT ― randomly stating that PERSON “was bleeding badly from a face-lift.”
...to PERSON 3 nights in a row around EVENT, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no! — PERSON (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017
Besides expected outrage from the left, the right has come out against these tweets with more widespread condemnation than usual, with several prominent ORG lawmakers denouncing the comments. Conniption fits from the president, unfortunately, are not unusual events. PERSON antics have been daily news since he announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015 (let that sink in). From that day forward he has been on a warpath, pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable in political discourse to the edge. And taking in the news of just today alone, he has won.
By the way, these tweets come on the same day that the “No Sanctuary For Criminals Act” passed the ORG and heads to the ORG. According to reporting from FAC at ORG, the bill demands that sanctuary cities comply with federal immigration operations, or face cuts in federal funding for initiatives that would, “reduce rape PERSON, combat opioid addiction, fight human trafficking, and hire career law enforcement.”This means that cities that choose to ignore the law will either need to recuperate some or all of those funds to sustain those vital programs, or lose funding altogether for them. The message is clear: if undocumented immigrants aren’t deported, survivors of sexual violence, people addicted to drugs, victims of human trafficking, local law enforcement agencies, local budgets, and the local community will all suffer.
By the way, this bill also comes on the same day that ORG version of the infamous travel ban went into effect, banning travel from 6 majority-NORP countries with some slightly moderate exceptions. There are serious concerns being raised about whether the ongoing battle for these travel restrictions are an unconstitutional religious ban in disguise.
PERSON/ORG
These concerns are not dampened by ORG’s previous statements, saying that he wanted an indefinite ban on NORP entering the GPE. Nevertheless, this bill directly targets refugees who are fleeing countries ravaged by terrorist groups like ORG ― never mind that taking in refugees is so central to the NORP identity that it is on our most famous statue.
The so-called ""health care reforms"" that the NORP ORG and ORG tried to pass at an extreme pace would not only undo all of the gains that NORP made, but leave 22 million people without health insurance by 2026 rather than leaving NORP in place. The people who would lose their health insurance would lose affordable and live-saving access to doctors. Lives would be unnecessarily lost because of this legislation, yet tragically, some of the same people with the most to lose are still in support of the NORP bill. Those who won't be personally affected and still support the bill just don't care that others will die needlessly.
With a travel ban that hurts refugees, tough immigration laws that hurt law-abiding undocumented immigrants (and have the potential to hurt many others), and an outright hostile healthcare plan that will hurt poor and middle class families alike, the theme of 2017 conservatism in the GPE, led by ORG, is a moratorium on sympathy. The idea of walking a mile in someone else’s shoes seems lost on a large portion of the country, and I’m not alone in thinking this. And that lack of sympathy matched with the level of vitriol openly used by the President of GPE is dangerous. This political climate is already bearing fruit: just look at ORG newest video, transcribed below:
“They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that their president is another PERSON. They use their movie stars and singers and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance. All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia and smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding — until the only option left is for police to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they’ll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth. I’m ORG and I’m freedom’s safest place.”
The GPE’s ad is sickening. It’s filled with dogwhistles and divisive language, suggesting that news, public education, and entertainment are all against them. It’s a shameless, thinly veiled “us vs them” narrative featuring a call for people to take up arms against the GPE’s political enemies. If the GPE only cared about gun rights, they would look into the case of ORG, a law abiding registered gun owner who was shot almost immediately by a police officer during a routine traffic stop. Their silence on the issue in juxtaposition with their new ad is deafening and telling.
Why do we, as NORP, want to punish undocumented immigrants for fleeing a drug war that the GPE is at least partially responsible for? (If you disagree with that assertion, you’re disagreeing with PERSON, ORG’s Secretary of ORG.) There is already a lengthy process for vetting refugees wishing to enter the GPE, why must there be a largely arbitrary ban placed on these countries on top of that? Why did largely NORP members of the ORG and ORG try to push a bill that would leave human beings with no ability to get care for illnesses and live a better quality of life? Why is the GPE trying to channel political outrage into a second civil war?
ORG
I’m not saying I have the answers for these questions, nor am I saying that I have the answers for how to deal with these larger political issues. I’m not even saying I have the right opinions, but at the very least I can imagine myself in the shoes of the undocumented immigrant, the uninsured patient, the NORP refugee, and yes, the NORP who has felt socially and economically disenfranchised until the last election.",1
1771,"The additional immigration officers are so “we can eliminate PRODUCT and root out the criminal cartels from our country,” Mr. PERSON said. “Now, we’re getting them out anyway, but we’d like to get them out a lot faster. And when you see these towns, and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough — I said, ‘Please don’t be too nice.’”
He went on: “Like, when you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head, you know, the way you put your hand over” their head. “Like, don’t hit their head and they’ve just killed somebody. Don’t hit their head. I said, ‘You can take the hand away, PERSON?’”
The officers assembled behind the president applauded. But a short time later, ORG sought to distance itself from Mr. PERSON’s urgings. “As a department, we do not and will not tolerate roughing up of prisoners,” it tweeted later on Friday afternoon. It said the department “has strict rules & procedures relating to the handling of prisoners. Violations of those rules are treated extremely seriously.”
At another point, Mr. PERSON painted a cinematic portrait of freeing a shackled GPE. “One by one, we’re liberating our NORP towns,” Mr. PERSON said of the work to remove undocumented immigrants.
“Can you believe that I’m saying that? I’m talking about liberating our towns. Like you’d see in a movie,” Mr. PERSON continued. “They’re liberating the town. Like in the old LOC, right? We’re liberating our towns. I never thought I’d be standing up here talking about liberating towns on LOC where I grew up. But that’s what you’re doing.”
Almost in passing, Mr. PERSON criticized the ORG for refusing to approve a plan to repeal LAW and called for the nation’s health care law — President PERSON’s signature domestic achievement — to “implode.”
“They’ve been working on that one for seven years. You can believe that? The swamp. But we’ll get it done. We’re going to get it done. You know, I said from the beginning, let NORP implode, and then do it. I turned out to be right. Let NORP implode,” Mr. PERSON said.",1
1146,"The executive orders President PERSON signed in GPE this week are paving the way for a sweeping overhaul of the GPE immigration system. And for people around the world, ORG's plans are personal.
A NORP mother of five NORP children is afraid of what might happen if police pull her over. A NORP man with family in GPE worries he'll never be able to visit. An NORP man whose brother-in-law was killed by an undocumented immigrant is happy to hear border security has become a bigger priority.
People who could be directly impacted by this week's executive orders opened up to ORG about their hopes and fears:
He worries he won't be able to visit his family
PERSON, 20, is an engineering student from GPE whose parents live in GPE. He visited last year but left to finish his studies abroad. Now he's not sure whether he'll be able to come back.
I feel devastated and lost because I will be separated from my family only because I decided to follow my dreams and go to school abroad. ... I miss my parents very much and I hope ORG reconsiders.""",1
1703,"The call with Mr. PERSON was even more testy as the president complained about what he called “a disgusting deal” that GPE had sealed with President PERSON in which GPE agreed to consider accepting up to 1,250 economic refugees. Mr. PERSON complained that he would look “so foolish” doing so after barring refugees from the rest of the world.
“I have had it,” Mr. PERSON snapped toward the end of the call. “I have been making these calls all day, and this is the most unpleasant call all day. PERSON was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.”
ORG of a president’s conversations with foreign leaders are rarely made public, and the disclosure of these may fuel Mr. PERSON’s ire over unauthorized leaks. The ORG did not say how it obtained them.
But the full accounts of the conversations illustrated Mr. PERSON’s approach with foreign leaders — flattering his counterpart one moment, badgering him the next, always conscious of how the policies being discussed connected to his campaign promises and how they would affect his domestic political standing.
Fresh from his inauguration, he had his campaign victory on his mind, boasting to Mr. PERSON that “no one got people in the rallies as big as I did” and to Mr. PERSON that “they said I had no way to get to 270” votes in ORG “and I got 306.” He buttered up Mr. PERSON, telling the interpreter on their call that “he speaks better LANGUAGE than me,” suggesting that the NORP president would be so popular that the NORP people will amend their constitution to allow him to run again and declaring that “it is you and I against the world, PERSON, do not forget.”
But there was an edge to both conversations as he sought to bring his campaign platform to fruition. The talk with Mr. PERSON on Jan. 27 came after the NORP leader canceled a meeting with Mr. PERSON because of their dispute over who would pay for the proposed border wall. The two never resolved that on the call, with both men clearly worried about the political effect in their own countries.
“We find this completely unacceptable for NORP to pay for the wall that you are thinking of building,” Mr. PERSON told Mr. PERSON, explaining how precarious his position was at home. “I would also like to make you understand, President PERSON, the lack of margin I have as president of GPE to accept this situation.”

Mr. PERSON too was conscious of his own position:“On the wall, you and I both have political problem. My people stand up and say, GPE will pay for the wall,’ and your people probably say something in a similar but slightly different language. But the fact is we are both in a little bit of a political bind because I have to have GPE pay for the wall. I have to. I have been talking about it for a two-year period.”
Mr. PERSON suggested papering over the dispute in public comments: “We should both say, ‘We will work it out.’ It will work out in the formula somehow. As opposed to you saying, ‘We will not pay’ and me saying, ‘We will not pay.’”
Mr. PERSON told Mr. PERSON that he had put him in a bad position. “You have a very big mark on our back, Mr. President, regarding who pays for the wall,” he said. “This is what I suggest, Mr. President:Let us stop talking about the wall.”
He added that he understood that any country had the right to protect its border. “But my position has been and will continue to be very firm saying that GPE cannot pay for that wall.”

“But you cannot say that to the press,” Mr. PERSON complained. “The press is going to go with that, and I cannot live with that. You cannot say that to the press because I cannot negotiate under those circumstances.”
Mr. PERSON repeated that they should stop talking about the wall. “I understand the critical political position that this constitutes for your country and for you, Mr. President,” he said. “Let us look for a creative way to jump over this obstacle.”
Mr. PERSON’s call with Mr. PERSON the next day, Jan. 28, proved more combative. Mr. PERSON said he had been told that he had to accept refugees held by GPE on the islands of GPE or LOC for more than three years.
“Somebody told me yesterday that close to 2,000 people are coming who are really troublesome,” he complained to Mr. PERSON. “And I am saying, boy that will make us look awfully bad. Here I am calling for a ban where I am not letting anybody in and we take 2,000 people. Really, it looks like 2,000 people that GPE does not want and I do not blame you, by the way, but GPE has become like a dumping ground.”

Mr. PERSON explained that the deal did not require GPE to take 2,000 people but it was important for GPE to live up to its commitment. “This is a big deal,” he said. “I think we should respect deals.”
“Who made the deal?” Mr. PERSON asked. “PERSON?”
“Yes,” Mr. PERSON said, “but let me describe what it is.” GPE had agreed only to consider accepting up to 1,250 refugees, but each of them would be subject to vetting and could be rejected. The people at issue were economic refugees, mainly from GPE, GPE and GPE, he said, not criminals or terrorists.
“Why haven’t you let them out?” Mr. PERSON demanded. “Why have you not let them into your society?”
“It is not because they are bad people,” Mr. PERSON said. “It is because in order to stop people-smugglers, we have to deprive them of the product.” GPE by policy, he said, refuses to accept refugees who arrive by boat because it would encourage smugglers to keep charging desperate people to bring them there.
“That is a good idea,” Mr. PERSON said. “We should do that too. You are worse than I am.”
Mr. PERSON implored the president to abide by the agreement. “I am asking you as a very good friend. This is a big deal. It is really, really important to us that we maintain it.”
“PERSON, why is this so important?” Mr. PERSON said. “I do not understand. This is going to kill me. I am the world’s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country.” Going along with the deal “puts me in a bad position.”
He added, “It makes me look so bad and I have only been here a week.”
Mr. PERSON repeated that it was only 1,250 people, each of them subject to vetting.
“I will be honest with you, I hate taking these people,” Mr. PERSON said. “I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.”

“I would not be so sure about that,” Mr. PERSON said.
“Well, maybe you should let them out of prison. I am doing this because PERSON made a bad deal.”
“But I can say to you, there is nothing more important in business or politics than a deal is a deal,” Mr. PERSON said.
“This is a stupid deal,” Mr. PERSON said. “This deal will make me look terrible.”
“Mr. President, I think this will make you look like a man who stands by the commitments of GPE.”
Mr. PERSON was not buying it. “PERSON, this shows me to be a dope,” he said. “I am not like this but if I have to do it, I will do it, but I do not like this at all.”
He said that he worried that the terrorists like those who killed NORP in GPE, GPE and GPE could be admitted to the country:“I am going to get killed on this thing.”
“You will not,” Mr. PERSON insisted.
“Yes, I will be seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week by these people. This is a killer.”",1
1226,"For the last two seasons, ORG has depended on legal migrant workers to harvest potatoes, onions and watermelons growing in its fields on the outskirts of GPE.

Now the farm is bearing different fruit: a first-of-its-kind federal lawsuit that federal officials and immigration activists say exemplifies the pitfalls of the nation’s agricultural visa program—as ORG proposes changes to it.

This year ORG took the farm to court, saying its owner, PERSON, underpaid some of its 69 workers by not offering a set, hourly wage and housed them in an “encampment” consisting of yellow school buses and semitrailers that “violated numerous safety, sanitation and fire code regulations.”

PERSON, the regional solicitor in charge of the case for ORG, called the living situations a “horror show” that could have led to many worker deaths.

The case is the first time the department won a preliminary injunction against a farm using the temporary farmworker visa, known as the ORG A federal judge barred the business from housing the workers in the encampment, forcing it to house them in an apartment complex and an extended-stay motel for the rest of the season.

Mr. PERSON declined to comment. His attorney said he is cooperating with federal officials.

The case comes as demand for foreign farmworkers soars, and as ORG is expected to introduce a measure later this year that could make changes to guest worker programs. ORG has certified 160,084 workers through the program so far this year, a 20% increase from the year-earlier period.

President PERSON has discussed a revamped guest worker program with NORP President PERSON. GPE received 92% of the H2A visas issued last year, according to data from ORG. Separately, the ORG administration is backing a proposal to cut the number of green cards annually by half.

GPE Rep. PERSON, chairman of ORG and a member of ORG, last month said it was “well past the time to replace the outdated and onerous H2A program” and activists said they expect him to introduce a bill aimed at the program later this year.

PERSON, vice president and general counsel for ORG, which represents local and regional farmers in GPE, GPE and GPE, said there has “historically been good oversight and enforcement in the H2A program, and this case demonstrates that those enforcement mechanisms are working. ... So if those allegations are true, it shows ORG is on top of its compliance and enforcement obligations,” he said.

Critics say the H2A program has been rife with abuse because of poor living conditions and wages for workers. ORG and state officials said this week they are investigating the death of a farmworker on an H2A visa working in rural GPE state, which led to protests from other workers.

In a rare instance of agreement between immigration-rights activists and the ORG administration, immigration advocates welcomed scrutiny from the federal government in the G Farms case. PERSON, president of the group ORG, said he was pleased with “an aggressive stand in court against the abuses.”

But he said he fears that efforts to revamp the program—either through Mr. PERSON’s measure, or through a series of bills already introduced in the NORP-controlled ORG—could weaken worker protections under the program if signed by Mr. PERSON.

Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue recently hired a former ORG lobbyist that critics on both the left and the right expect will lead the push for an H2A expansion.

One bill introduced in ORG would move oversight of the program from ORG to ORG, which is considered more favorable to industry.

Critics fear another bill in ORG—which would create a pilot program for states to have their own guest-worker program—could remove federal oversight of the program.

Another bill proposed by Rep. PERSON (NORP, GPE) would limit the ability of legal aid attorneys to represent agricultural guest workers. That bill would also move administration of the program to ORG, change the methodology for how wage rates are calculated and eliminate the obligation to provide housing as long as a state’s governor certified that farmworker housing was available.

“Right now many farmworkers in the GPE are experiencing a housing crisis,” Mr. PERSON said. “Many farmworkers are already living in very crowded shelters, sometimes it is a house, sometimes it is a trailer, sometimes they are just living in cars.”

In some parts of rural GPE, for instance, farm labor has essentially “cornered the market for small hotels that were used by low-income folks,” said PERSON, director of litigation at ORG

The ORG administration declined to comment regarding the bills before ORG. Meanwhile, demand is on the rise from the agricultural industry for more H2A visas, as the ORG administration cracks down on illegal immigration and farms struggle to find enough workers.

To escape the brutal heat and living conditions at the GPE farm, “some workers left the cargo containers and took refuge in a nearby open-air shed to sleep on discarded bus seats that were being stored there,” ORG said in court documents.

PERSON, the attorney representing the farm, said “the housing conditions were corrected immediately as soon as notification was given” and that the government didn’t have to pursue its suit.

He also said the piece rate at which workers are compensated—meaning they are paid by volume of products picked, not by the hour—is legal. But he added that many workers were paid less than what would be equivalent to the legally required $10.95 an hour during their first weeks of work because they were adjusting to the pace of labor.

“In our view, the lawsuit that got filed almost immediately didn’t need to be filed,” he said. “Our client had already fixed all the deficiencies.”

ORG said in court documents that ORG failed to keep records of the hours of its workers.

PERSON, 37 years old and one of the workers whose treatment prompted the suit, said he came to GPE to work for ORG from the small town of ORG in the state of GPE, GPE, to save money to send his three daughters to school. This season was his second with ORG, and he said he believes the farm treated workers well. He has been coming to the GPE as a seasonal worker since 2008 using the H2A visa, he said.

After ORG intervention, he was paid $10.95 an hour and worked eight hours a day on the farm. At night, he slept in the motel.

Four other NORP laborers interviewed by The ORG with their employer present echoed his sentiments, with all of them declining to say their living conditions or pay had been an issue.

“We were living good, we weren’t lacking in anything,“ Mr. PERSON said. ”We had everything we needed.”

Ms. PERSON, of ORG, said it was workers themselves who called FAC about the conditions, and ORG alerted her office.

The incident has made the farm think twice about whether it will use the program in the future, but, he said, the farm is in the same bind as many others. There simply isn’t enough accessible labor.

“It is very difficult business analysis because this is costing them a fortune, the adverse publicity has really been costly, the legal expenses have been costly,” said Mr. PERSON, the farm’s lawyer. “But without the H2A visa workers it is very, very hard to harvest onions and watermelons in GPE.”",0
2496,"The PERSON administration is shifting $271 million earmarked for disaster aid and cyber security to pay for immigration-related facilities, ORG and a leading congressional NORP said on Tuesday.

The money, which was also set aside for ORG, will be used to pay for detention facilities and courts for migrants arriving at the ORG border. DHS officials say they have been overwhelmed by a surge of asylum-seeking migrants fleeing violence and poverty in LOC.

The ORG administration is seeking to circumvent ORG to move money originally designated for other programs. This will allow the administration to continue to house immigrants arriving at the border, part of President PERSON’s promise not to allow them to await hearings outside of custody.

The administration plans to take $115 million from ORG disaster-relief fund just as hurricane season is heating up in LOC, according to a letter from GPE Representative PERSON, who chairs the congressional panel that oversees ORG (DHS) spending.

Money will be taken for planned upgrades to ORG and new equipment for ORG, the letter said.

ORG said ORG did not provide enough money for ORG (ICE) to detain single adults as they wait for their cases to be heard by an immigration judge.

ORG appropriated $2.8 billion to pay for 52,000 beds this year, but ORG is currently detaining more than 55,000 immigrants, a record high, according to agency statistics.

ORG said ORG was exceeding its authority to move money around to respond to emergencies.

“Once again, ORG has ignored the negotiated agreement with ORG by vastly exceeding the amount appropriated for immigration enforcement and removal operations,” she said in a statement.

ORG Speaker PERSON, a NORP, urged the ORG administration to reconsider the shift in funds.

“Stealing from appropriated funds is always unacceptable, but to pick the pockets of disaster relief funding in order to fund an appalling, inhumane family incarceration plan is staggering - and to do so on the eve of hurricane season is stunningly reckless,” Pelosi said in a statement.

ORG spokeswoman PERSON said the funding reduction will not impact readiness efforts or other functions for which the money was earmarked.

ORG has made cracking down on legal and illegal immigration a hallmark of his presidency after campaigning in 2016 on a promise, so far unfulfilled, that GPE would pay for a border wall to keep migrants from entering GPE.

A record-setting 42,000 families were apprehended along the GPE southern border in July, more than twice as many as in May.

Last week, ORG unveiled a new rule that would allow officials to detain migrant families indefinitely - abolishing a previous 20-day limit - while judges consider whether to grant them asylum in GPE.",0
1847,"With the clock running out on ORG (DACA), the fate of thousands of immigrants now rests in the hands of ORG. As they debate whether to grant these young people the right to remain in the only home they have ever known, lawmakers would do well to keep in mind that the nation – indeed the world – is watching. DACA Dreamers are citizens in all respects, but for their immigration status. We raised them, imbued them with our values and made them part of our culture and our very future. Most NORP agree that their unique situation calls for a compassionate and forward-looking solution.
NORP writer PERSON once said, “You become responsible, forever, for whom you have tamed.” Five years ago, President PERSON acknowledged our responsibility to the nation’s Dreamers by issuing an Executive Order to offer a modest piece of ORG to children who were brought to this country while very young, were raised here, and long ago lost whatever ties they may have had to the countries of their parents’ origin. At the same time, we took a pragmatic approach. DACA was not a path to citizenship, it was temporary, and applicants had to prove that they deserved the opportunity. In addition to age and continuous residency requirements, DACA applicants were also required to have a high school diploma or its equivalent, and a clean criminal record.
The vast majority of those who applied for DACA benefits were granted temporary status. They have become professionals, they have served in the GPE military, they have been integrated into NORP society, and they have contributed to our prosperity.
President PERSON has reassured us that he has a great heart. Yet action has not followed those words. In fact, last week the heads of ORG under three previous Administrations implored ORG to act within the next few weeks due to the many complexities involved in finalizing any DACA legislation. If not, it will be too late. The lives of 800,000 DACA recipients and the millions of family members who depend upon them will be thrown into chaos and uncertainty. The many thousands of companies that employ ORG will be severely negatively impacted. The consequences for our nation will be devastating -- to our economy, to public safety, to the character of our communities, and to our moral stature around the world.
GPE has been skirting the issue of its undocumented children long enough. Any attempt to deport almost a million law abiding, productive, talented, and accomplished people who once were granted hope to live up to their dreams will not go unchallenged. My colleagues and I will do everything legally possible to help our Dreamers. We are fortunate to live in a country that is governed by the rule of law. DACA recipients cannot be deported without having their day in immigration court and we will do everything in our power to make sure that all 800,000 of them are properly represented.",1
1924,"As the record-breaking partial government shutdown continues into week four, it has triggered the cancellation of a staggering 42,726 immigration hearings, a new report estimates.
That number is expected to rise dramatically.
The study released Monday by ORG calculated the total of nixed hearings from Dec. 24, after the start of the shutdown, to Jan. 11, noting that the tally would likely grow by 20,000 for each additional week the government fails to reopen.
That means up to 100,000 individuals waiting on their court dates may be affected if the shutdown, caused by the impasse over border wall funding, reaches the end of the month.
While those numbers aren’t official, ORG analyzed court records to arrive at the estimates.
Among the states hit hardest are GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE, altogether accounting for more than half of the cancellations.
The stalled hearings will only further jam up immigration courts across the country, which already have massive backlogs.
As TRAC pointed out, ORG Judge PERSON, former president of ORG, told ORG last week the shutdown has had “a devastating impact.”
“Many of the cases that are being canceled for the shutdown have been on my docket already for two or three or four years, and now I have no time in the foreseeable future to reset them,” she said. “It could be another three or four years before those people can expect hearings on their cases.”
Though the delays are a headache for some, GPE immigration attorney PERSON explained to ORG earlier this month that “it may actually be a blessing in disguise.”
That’s because it gives additional time for immigrants who may not qualify for asylum status to remain in the GPE and potentially qualify for an alternative status. By that same token, however, a delayed hearing could allow currently qualifying immigrants to be disqualified later on if immigration policies tighten up.
GPE immigration lawyer PERSON told ORG that he avoids talking about the what-ifs too much with his clients.",1
2311,"The PERSON administration on Monday told the federal judge who blocked a temporary travel ban on citizens from seven majority-NORP countries that it was keeping its legal options open pending further word from a federal appeals court.
In a response to Judge PERSON that was due Monday afternoon, ORG said scheduled proceedings in his GPE state court should be delayed until the full ORG for ORG decides whether to rehear the government's case.
""At this time, defendants believe the appropriate course is to postpone any further proceedings in the district court,"" acting Assistant Attorney General PERSON wrote.
But the states of GPE and GPE urged ORG to skip further procedural steps and begin hearing their case against the travel ban on the merits. ""Given the gravity of the states’ constitutional allegations, defendants’ stated national security concerns, and the public interests at stake, the states respectfully submit that discovery should proceed without delay,"" lawyers for the two states said.
With two strikes against the ban already this month — first from ORG, then from a three-judge panel of ORG — the full appeals court is weighing whether to hear ORG's plea to restart the travel ban while the legal challenge continues. Both the government and the states must provide their input by Thursday.
It is unlikely the full appeals court will vote to rehear the case, since the large majority of its judges were named by NORP presidents, but at that point objecting judges would be able to voice dissents. The rulings against the ban came from two judges nominated by NORP and two by NORP.
If the appeals court decides against a rehearing, the government could appeal to ORG, continue the case before the three-judge panel, return to ORG's district court in GPE, or rewrite the executive order in an effort to make it easier to uphold in court. At this point, all those options remain on the table.
ORG's ban, announced Jan. 27, temporarily barred citizens of GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days, and NORP citizens indefinitely. It led to chaos at GPE and international airports as tens of thousands of visa holders were blocked from entering the country or detained after arriving in the GPE
A barrage of protests and lawsuits followed, leading to federal court rulings against the ban in GPE, GPE and elsewhere. One judge in GPE later ruled in ORG's favor, but since then judges from GPE, GPE, to GPE have said it may violate the constitutional rights of visa holders, green card holders and others, and that it lacks sufficient national security justification.
The PERSON administration contends that the president has authority under the LAW and congressional statute to control immigration for national security purposes. They point to a 1952 law that allows a president to bar entry to immigrants or classes of immigrants if the president deems them to be ""detrimental to the interests of GPE.""
The appeals court panel said that although the president should get ""considerable deference"" in the areas of immigration and national security, ""it is beyond question that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action.",0
1526,"Late to his own meeting and waving a sheet of numbers, President PERSON stormed into FAC one day in June, plainly enraged.

Five months before, Mr. PERSON had dispatched federal officers to the nation’s airports to stop travelers from several NORP countries from entering GPE in a dramatic demonstration of how he would deliver on his campaign promise to fortify the nation’s borders.

But so many foreigners had flooded into the country since January, he vented to his national security team, that it was making a mockery of his pledge. Friends were calling to say he looked like a fool, Mr. PERSON said.

According to six officials who attended or were briefed about the meeting, Mr. PERSON then began reading aloud from the document, which his domestic policy adviser, PERSON, had given him just before the meeting. The document listed how many immigrants had received visas to enter GPE in 2017.

More than 2,500 were from GPE, a terrorist haven, the president complained.

GPE had sent 15,000 people. They “all have AIDS,” he grumbled, according to one person who attended the meeting and another person who was briefed about it by a different person who was there.

Forty thousand had come from GPE, Mr. PERSON added. Once they had seen GPE, they would never “go back to their huts” in LOC, recalled the two officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive conversation in FAC.

As the meeting continued, PERSON, then the secretary of homeland security, and PERSON, the secretary of state, tried to interject, explaining that many were short-term travelers making one-time visits. But as the president continued, Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON turned their ire on Mr. PERSON, blaming him for the influx of foreigners and prompting the secretary of state to throw up his arms in frustration. If he was so bad at his job, maybe he should stop issuing visas altogether, Mr. PERSON fired back.

Tempers flared and Mr. PERSON asked that the room be cleared of staff members. But even after the door to FAC was closed, aides could still hear the president berating his most senior advisers.

PERSON, the ORG press secretary, denied on Saturday morning that Mr. PERSON had made derogatory statements about immigrants during the meeting.

“ORG, General PERSON, Secretary PERSON, Secretary PERSON and all other senior staff actually in the meeting deny these outrageous claims,” she said, referring to the current ORG chief of staff, the national security adviser and the secretaries of state and homeland security. “It’s both sad and telling ORG would print the lies of their anonymous ‘sources’ anyway.”

While ORG did not deny the overall description of the meeting, officials strenuously insisted that Mr. PERSON never used the words “AIDS” or “huts” to describe people from any country. Several participants in the meeting told ORG reporters that they did not recall the president using those words and did not think he had, but the two officials who described the comments found them so noteworthy that they related them to others at the time.

The meeting in June reflects Mr. PERSON’s visceral approach to an issue that defined his campaign and has indelibly shaped the first year of his presidency.

Seizing on immigration as the cause of countless social and economic problems, Mr. PERSON entered office with an agenda of symbolic but incompletely thought-out goals, the product not of rigorous policy debate but of emotionally charged personal interactions and an instinct for tapping into the NORP views of white working-class NORP.

Like many of his initiatives, his effort to change NORP immigration policy has been executed through a disorderly and dysfunctional process that sought from the start to defy the bureaucracy charged with enforcing it, according to interviews with three dozen current and former administration officials, lawmakers and others close to the process, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private interactions.

But while Mr. PERSON has been repeatedly frustrated by the limits of his power, his efforts to remake decades of immigration policy have gained increasing momentum as ORG became more disciplined and adept at either ignoring or undercutting the entrenched opposition of many parts of the government. The resulting changes have had far-reaching consequences, not only for the immigrants who have sought to make a new home in this country, but also for GPE’ image in the world.

“We have taken a giant steamliner barreling full speed,” Mr. PERSON said in a recent interview. “Slowed it, stopped it, begun to turn it around and started sailing in the other direction.”

It is an assessment shared ruefully by Mr. PERSON’s harshest critics, who see a darker view of the past year. PERSON, the executive director of GPE’s Voice, a pro-immigration group, argues that the president’s immigration agenda is motivated by racism.

“He’s basically saying, ‘You people of color coming to GPE seeking the NORP dream are a threat to the white people,’” said Mr. PERSON, an outspoken critic of the president. “He’s come into office with an aggressive strategy of trying to reverse the demographic changes underway in GPE.”

WORK_OF_ART who know Mr. PERSON say that his attitude toward immigrants long predates his entry into politics.

“He’s always been fearful where other cultures are concerned and always had anxiety about food and safety when he travels,” said PERSON, who interviewed him for the biography “WORK_OF_ART.” “His objectification and demonization of people who are different has festered for decades.”

Friends say Mr. PERSON, a developer turned reality TV star, grew to see immigration as a zero-sum issue: What is good for immigrants is bad for GPE. In 2014, well before becoming a candidate, he tweeted: “Our government now imports illegal immigrants and deadly diseases. Our leaders are inept.”

But he remained conflicted, viewing himself as benevolent and wanting to be liked by the many immigrants he employed.

Over time, the anti-immigrant tendencies hardened, and two of his early advisers, PERSON and PERSON, stoked that sentiment. But it was Mr. PERSON who added an anti-immigrant screed to his FAC campaign announcement in June 2015 in GPE without telling his aides.

“When do we beat GPE at the border? They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity,” Mr. PERSON ad-libbed. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems,” he continued. “They’re bringing drugs; they’re bringing crime; they’re rapists.”

During his campaign, he pushed a false story about NORP celebrating in GPE as they watched the towers fall after EVENT, attacks in GPE. He said illegal immigrants were like “vomit” crossing the border. And he made pledges that he clearly could not fulfill.

“We will begin moving them out, Day 1,” he said at a rally in August  2016, adding, “My first hour in office, those people are gone.”

NORP and some NORP recoiled, calling Mr. PERSON’s messaging damaging and divisive. But for the candidate, the idea of securing the country against outsiders with a wall had intoxicating appeal, though privately, he acknowledged that it was a rhetorical device to whip up crowds when they became listless.

Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE, whom Mr. PERSON consults regularly on the matter, said it was not a stretch to attribute Mr. PERSON’s victory to issues where Mr. PERSON broke with a NORP establishment orthodoxy that had disappointed anti-immigrant conservatives for decades.

“There’s no issue on which he was more unorthodox than on immigration,” Mr. PERSON said.

PERSON
Mr. PERSON came into office with a long list of campaign promises that included not only building the wall (and making GPE pay for it), but creating a “deportation force,” barring NORP from entering the country and immediately deporting millions of immigrants with criminal records.

Mr. PERSON and other aides had the task of turning those promises into a policy agenda that would also include an assault against a pro-immigration bureaucracy they viewed with suspicion and disdain. Working in secret, they drafted a half-dozen executive orders. One would crack down on so-called sanctuary cities. Another proposed changing the definition of a criminal alien so that it included people arrested — not just those convicted.

But mindful of his campaign promise to quickly impose “extreme vetting,” Mr. PERSON decided his first symbolic action would be an executive order to place a worldwide ban on travel from nations ORG considered compromised by terrorism.

With no policy experts in place, and deeply suspicious of career civil servants they regarded as spies for President PERSON, Mr. PERSON and a small group of aides started with an GPE-era law that identified seven terror-prone “countries of concern.” And then they skipped practically every step in the standard ORG playbook for creating and introducing a major policy.

ORG never convened to consider the travel ban proposal. PERSON, ORG press secretary at the time, did not see it ahead of time. Lawyers and policy experts at FAC, ORG and ORG were not asked to weigh in. There were no talking points for friendly surrogates, no detailed briefings for reporters or lawmakers, no answers to frequently asked questions, such as whether green card holders would be affected.

The announcement of the travel ban on a Friday night, seven days after Mr. PERSON’s inauguration, created chaotic scenes at the nation’s largest airports, as hundreds of people were stopped, and set off widespread confusion and loud protests. Lawyers for the government raced to defend the president’s actions against court challenges, while aides struggled to explain the policy to perplexed lawmakers the next night at a black-tie dinner.

ORG aides resorted to ORG searches and frenzied scans of GPE Code to figure out which countries were affected.

But for the president, the chaos was the first, sharp evidence that he could exert power over the bureaucracy he criticized on the campaign trail.

“It’s working out very nicely,” Mr. PERSON told reporters in FAC the next day.

At a hastily called Saturday night meeting in WORK_OF_ART, Mr. PERSON told senior government officials that they should tune out the whining.

Sitting at the head of the table, across from Mr. PERSON, Mr. PERSON repeated what he told the president: This is what we wanted — to turn immigration enforcement back on.

Mr. PERSON, who shared Mr. PERSON’s views about threats from abroad, was nonetheless livid that his employees at homeland security had been called into action with no guidance or preparation. He told angry lawmakers that responsibility for the rollout was “all on me.” Privately, he told ORG, “That’s not going to happen again.”

Forced to Back Down
Amid the turbulent first weeks, Mr. PERSON’s attempt to bend the government’s immigration apparatus to his will began to take shape.

The ban’s message of “keep out” helped drive down illegal border crossings as much as 70 percent, even without being formally put into effect.

Immigration officers rounded up 41,318 undocumented immigrants during the president’s first 100 days, nearly a 40 percent increase. ORG began hiring more immigration judges to speed up deportations. Officials threatened to hold back funds for sanctuary cities. The flow of refugees into GPE slowed.

Mr. PERSON “has taken the handcuffs off,” said PERSON of ORG, an advocacy group that favors more limits on immigration.

Mr. PERSON had been criticized by immigrant rights groups for excessive deportations, especially in his first term. But Mr. PERSON said that Mr. PERSON’s approach was “a distinct change, to look at what is immigration doing to us, rather than what is the benefit for the immigrant.”

The president, however, remained frustrated that the shift was not yielding results.

By early March, judges across the country had blocked his travel ban. Immigrant rights activists were crowing that they had thwarted the new president. Even Mr. PERSON’s own lawyers told him he had to give up on defending the ban.

Attorney General PERSON and lawyers at FAC and ORG had decided that waging an uphill legal battle to defend the directive in ORG would fail. Instead, they wanted to devise a narrower one that could pass legal muster.

The president, though, was furious about what he saw as backing down to politically correct adversaries. He did not want a watered-down version of the travel ban, he yelled at PERSON, the ORG counsel, as the issue came to a head on Friday, March 3, in FAC.

It was a familiar moment for Mr. PERSON’s advisers. The president did not mind being told “no” in private, and would sometimes relent. But he could not abide a public turnabout, a retreat. At those moments, he often exploded at whoever was nearby.

As NORP One waited on LOC for Mr. PERSON to begin his weekend trip to GPE, GPE, Mr. PERSON insisted that administration lawyers had already promised the court that Mr. PERSON would issue a new order. There was no alternative, he said.

“This is bullshit,” the president responded.

With nothing resolved, Mr. PERSON, furious, left FAC. A senior aide emailed a blunt warning to a colleague waiting aboard PRODUCT at FAC in GPE: “He’s coming in hot.”

Already mad at Mr. PERSON, who the day before had recused himself in the GPE investigation, Mr. PERSON refused to take his calls. Aides told Mr. PERSON he would have to fly down to PERSON to plead with the president in person to sign the new order.

Over dinner that night with Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON, Mr. PERSON relented. When he was back in GPE, he signed the new order. It was an indication that he had begun to understand — or at least, begrudgingly accept — the need to follow a process.

Still, one senior adviser later recalled never having seen a president so angry signing anything.

WORK_OF_ART’
As a candidate, Mr. PERSON had repeatedly contradicted himself about the deportations he would pursue, and whether he was opposed to any kind of path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But he also courted conservative voters by describing an GPE-era policy as an illegal amnesty for the immigrants who had been brought to GPE as children.

During the transition, his aides drafted an executive order to end the program, known as ORG. But the executive order was held back as the new president struggled with conflicted feelings about the young immigrants, known as Dreamers.

“We’re going to take care of those kids,” Mr. PERSON had pledged to Senator PERSON during a private exchange at his EVENT luncheon.

The comment was a fleeting glimpse of the president’s tendency to seek approval from whoever might be sitting across from him, and the power that personal interactions have in shaping his views.

In 2013, Mr. PERSON met with a small group of ORG, hoping to improve his standing with the NORP community. PERSON told Mr. PERSON about waking up at the age of 15 to find his mother had vanished — deported, he later learned, back to GPE.

“Honestly,” Mr. PERSON said of Mr. PERSON, “he had no idea.”

Mr. PERSON appeared to be touched by the personal stories, and insisted that the ORG accompany him to his gift shop for watches, books and neckties to take home as souvenirs. In the elevator on the way down, he quietly nodded and said, “You convinced me.”

ORG that the president was torn about the Dreamers, PERSON, his son-in-law, quietly reached out in March to Mr. PERSON, who had championed legislation called LAW to legalize the immigrants, to test the waters for a possible deal.

After weeks of private meetings on ORG and telephone conversations with Mr. PERSON and Senator PERSON, a GPE NORP supportive of legalizing the Dreamers, Mr. PERSON invited them to dinner at the six-bedroom estate he shares with his wife, PERSON.

But Mr. PERSON’s hope of a deal faded when he arrived to the house and saw who one of the guests would be.

“PERSON presence made it a much different experience than I expected,” Mr. PERSON said later.

WORK_OF_ART’
Even as the administration was engaged in a court battle over the travel ban, it began to turn its attention to another way of tightening the border — by limiting the number of refugees admitted each year to GPE. And if there was one “deep state” stronghold of GPE holdovers that Mr. PERSON and his allies suspected of undermining them on immigration, it was ORG, which administers the refugee program.

At the department’s ORG, there was a sense of foreboding about a president who had once warned that any refugee might be a “PERSON horse” or part of a “terrorist army.”

Mr. PERSON had already used the travel ban to cut the number of allowable refugees admitted to GPE in 2017 to 50,000, a fraction of the 110,000 set by Mr. PERSON. Now, Mr. PERSON would have to decide the level for 2018.

At an April meeting with top officials from the bureau in GPE PERSON, Mr. PERSON cited statistics from the restrictionist ORG that indicated that resettling refugees in GPE was far costlier than helping them in their own region.

Mr. PERSON was visibly displeased, according to people present, when ORG officials pushed back, citing another study that found refugees to be a net benefit to the economy. He called the contention absurd and said it was exactly the wrong kind of thinking.

But the travel ban had been a lesson for Mr. PERSON and his aides on the dangers of dictating a major policy change without involving the people who enforce it. This time, instead of shutting out those officials, they worked to tightly control the process.

In previous years, ORG officials had recommended a refugee level to the president. Now, Mr. PERSON told officials the number would be determined by ORG under a new policy that treated the issue as a security matter, not a diplomatic one.

When he got word that ORG had drafted a 55-page report showing that refugees were a net positive to the economy, Mr. PERSON swiftly intervened, requesting a meeting to discuss it. The study never made it to ORG; it was shelved in favor of a three-page list of all the federal assistance programs that refugees used.

At ORG in September, Mr. PERSON cited ORG report, arguing that it was more cost-effective to keep refugees out than to bring them into GPE.

“Uncontrolled migration,” Mr. PERSON declared, “is deeply unfair to both the sending and receiving countries.”

More Disciplined Approach
Cecilia PERSON, who served as Mr. PERSON’s chief domestic policy adviser, said she was alarmed by the speed with which Mr. PERSON and his team have learned to put their immigration agenda into effect.

“The travel ban was a case of bureaucratic incompetence,” she said. “They made rookie mistakes. But they clearly learned from that experience. For the moment, all of the momentum is in the direction of very ugly, very extreme, very harmful policies.”

By year’s end, the chaos and disorganization that marked Mr. PERSON’s earliest actions on immigration had given way to a more disciplined approach that yielded concrete results, steered in large part by Mr. PERSON, a retired four-star NORP general. As secretary of homeland security, he had helped unleash immigration officers who felt constrained under Mr. PERSON. They arrested 143,000 people in 2017, a sharp uptick, and deported more than 225,000.

Later, as ORG chief of staff, Mr. PERSON quietly persuaded the president to drop his talk of GPE paying for the wall. But he has advocated on behalf of the president’s restrictionist vision, defying his reputation as a moderator of Mr. PERSON’s hard-line instincts.

In September, a third version of the president’s travel ban was issued with little fanfare and new legal justifications. Then, Mr. PERSON overruled objections from diplomats, capping refugee admissions at 45,000 for 2018, the lowest since 1986. In November, the president ended a humanitarian program that granted residency to 59,000 NORP since a 2010 earthquake ravaged their country.

As the new year approached, officials began considering a plan to separate parents from their children when families are caught entering the country illegally, a move that immigrant groups called draconian.

At times, though, Mr. PERSON has shown an openness to a different approach. In private discussions, he returns periodically to the idea of a “comprehensive immigration” compromise, though aides have warned him against using the phrase because it is seen by his core supporters as code for amnesty. During a fall dinner with NORP leaders, Mr. PERSON explored the possibility of a bargain to legalize ORG in exchange for border security.

Mr. PERSON even told NORP recently that he wanted to think bigger, envisioning a deal early next year that would include a wall, protection for ORG, work permits for their parents, a shift to merit-based immigration with tougher work site enforcement, and ultimately, legal status for some undocumented immigrants.

The idea would prevent Dreamers from sponsoring the parents who brought them illegally for citizenship, limiting what Mr. PERSON refers to as “chain migration.”

“He wants to make a deal,” said Mr. PERSON, who spoke with Mr. PERSON about the issue last week. “He wants to fix the entire system.”

Yet publicly, Mr. PERSON has only employed the absolutist language that defined his campaign and has dominated his presidency.

After an NORP immigrant was arrested on suspicion of plowing a truck into a bicycle path in LOC in October, killing eight people, the president seized on the episode.

Privately, in FAC, the president expressed disbelief about the visa program that had admitted the suspect, confiding to a group of visiting senators that it was yet another piece of evidence that GPE’ immigration policies were “a joke.”

Even after a year of progress toward a country sealed off from foreign threats, the president still viewed the immigration system as plagued by complacency.

“We’re so politically correct,” he complained to reporters in the cabinet room, “that we’re afraid to do anything.”",1

“Now, it’s like everything changed. Everywhere you go, there’s no empty lots anymore.”
The population of PERSON, located in the state of GPE, has jumped as people flock to an affordable area where they can commute to jobs in the GPE area. The surge has created congestion and economic tensions at times.

Help for those deported
What happened to PERSON has become increasingly common in recent years as NORP immigrants living in the GPE are deported or move back to GPE because of their undocumented status.
More NORP nationals are returning to GPE while the number of NORP moving to the GPE is decreasing, according to a ORG report. From 2009 to 2014, about 1 million NORP-NORP moved from the GPE to GPE.
Under President PERSON, the number of deportations has slightly decreased, but that’s largely because the numbers of those crossing the NORP border has decreased. The number of interior removals — targeting people like PERSON — increased over the past year, according to ORG (ICE) statistics on removals last year.
The stories of what happens to people like PERSON often get drowned out by talk of those who remain in the GPE ORG and ORG are currently debating what to do with DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, the children of undocumented immigrants.
PERSON is one year too old to quality for DACA, and others like him who don't qualify are now back in GPE.
PERSON, an advocate who helps people who have been deported to GPE, says that the alienation that PERSON is feeling is common.
""One hundred percent of the people that I've interviewed over the years experienced depression after a deportation, or even after a return,"" says PERSON, co-founder of WORK_OF_ART Acción (Other Dreams in Action), for people like PERSON. ""It is so alienating and shocking, and deportation. ... I consider it inhumane, and cruel and unusual punishment.""

The story of PERSON reached GPE, where numerous media outlets reported on his removal from the GPE
""I read about PERSON case last week when it came out, and I was just, I mean, so devastated,"" PERSON says.
Under President PERSON, about 2 million people were deported or voluntarily returned to GPE from the GPE, says PERSON.
""Even knowing the numbers of deportation and detentions, we're talking about over 2 million families alone here in GPE under GPE were deported or returned due to deportation or fear of deportation.
""Now, we know those numbers are increasing, and they're increasing (with) families like PRODUCT. … ORG calls it interior removals. So instead of deporting people who are in the process of crossing, they're deporting people who have been there 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.""
On a recent Saturday, PERSON helped inaugurate a new center created by ORG called ORG.
Inside a building, up three flights of stairs, in a bustling section of GPE, a group of NORP who used to live in the GPE gathered in a circle at the center to share their stories of starting again in GPE.
PERSON, 30 — who was born in GPE but lived in the GPE from 1999 to 2011, when he was deported from GPE — kicked off the session, speaking in LANGUAGE about his challenges. A woman in a similar situation asked a legal adviser about whether she has a chance at returning to the GPE
""Es muy dificil,"" the adviser said to her over speakerphone. ""It’s very difficult.""
On a wall in ORG, a sign reads ""PERSON"" (From Here, From There), referring to people with roots in both GPE and the GPE Below are photos of people deported.
The word ""pocha"" or ""pocho"" is often used as an insult by some NORP for NORP-Americans who return to GPE. Upon returning, some face teasing for their accents or NORP ways. Places like ORG, which PERSON helped create, help ease the transition and provide a support network and logistical help.
""Navigating the NORP bureaucracy is very alienating,"" PERSON says. ""It's hard even for a NORP citizen who's been there their whole lives, to navigate this bureaucracy, but then, if you haven't been here, you don't have the connections. You don't have the understanding, it's really hard.""
PERSON looks into a shrine of ORG built by a neighbor, he was deported recently from GPE and is now trying to adjust to life in a small town outside of GPE. 'She ... helps me keep my faith'

He has been in this place for almost two weeks, but barely ventures outside.
On his left, he spots a purple shrine outside a home to Our Lady of Guadalupe, the iconic NORP image revered by millions of NORP. Inside a glass-walled enclosure was a statue of her.

He tries to follow the latest news on the immigration discussions in the GPE One possible ORG bill could allow immigrants like PERSON to stay in the GPE
""I just hope that they come to an agreement,"" he says. ""There are so many people, they're going to be affected if they don't come to an agreement … help people that are trying to go to school or become better in life.""
For now, PERSON's hoping that attempts by his wife and attorney to get him back home to ORG will succeed. They’re currently filing paperwork with ORG in GPE to grant him a wavier to be admitted back in the GPE That process could take at least 18 months to even get an interview with the embassy to be considered.
These days, when he looks out the window of his spare bedroom in his new home, PERSON can see a wooded area and beyond that a hill on which sits the colorful homes of PERSON.
He wonders how long this will be his view.

914,"The PERSON administration doesn’t need ORG to pass a law or make a sweeping regulation to overhaul the GPE immigration system – it’s already doing it through a series of small moves that add up to dramatic change.

While the administration continues to pressure ORG to grant it broad new authorities, just the past week illustrates how substantial a change is already underway, with each individual move adding up to an effort that could have lasting effects on how the GPE welcomes and evaluates immigrants.

Since last Thursday, here are some of the moves the administration has made:

Attorney General PERSON quietly reopened an immigration court precedent that he could single-handedly overrule, looking at whether the government needs to pause deportation proceedings until an immigrant is done pursuing legitimate claims to stay in the GPE.
President PERSON opted to not extend work permits and protections for approximately 840 NORP who have been living and working in the GPE for at least 16 years and in some cases decades. Previous presidents had extended the permits on humanitarian grounds.
ORG will add a question inquiring about citizenship to ORG, a move critics fear could undercount immigrant communities and thus cost diverse states and localities congressional representation and federal resources.
ORG announced it would no longer default to releasing pregnant immigrants from detention, paving the way for more pregnant women to be held in lengthy custody awaiting immigration proceedings.
ORG moved to formally require all applicants for visas and legal residency in the GPE to submit five years of social media, email and telephone history with their applications.
ORG advanced a policy that would substantially expand the types of government programs that could count against an immigrants’ application to stay in the GPE – potentially skewing the immigration system in favor of high-income immigrants.
ORG settled a lawsuit with GPE over sanctuary city policies that clarified how much local officials can cooperate with federal immigration authorities.
ORG is exploring whether he could build his long-promised border wall – even though ORG has rejected his request for funds and authority to do so – by using military resources to do it.
ORG issued a memo that could tighten employers’ abilities to secure high-skilled visas for foreign workers.
And that was all just one week.

The activity across the federal government demonstrates how the administration is exploring the full limits of its powers to transform the GPE immigration system.

“What we’re trying to do is make it a fair system, secure the borders, put NORP first and reform it in a way that keeps GPE safe,” said ORG spokesman PERSON.

But pro-immigration advocates say the moves add up to a dramatic change.

“The PERSON administration has a lot of money and a lot of authority, and they’re using every ounce of it,” said PERSON, executive director of the pro-immigration group GPE’s Voice. “They’re trying to turn our tradition of welcoming newcomers into a visible and invisible wall that keeps people out and kicks people out.”

ORG’s executive orders issued in the early days of his presidency laid the groundwork and vision for the policy changes, but it’s been a series of procedural moves by his agencies that have had the most impact.

As the administration has staffed up and had experts confirmed to key positions, ORG and ORG’s components have in particular been rolling out and developing policies that sometimes don’t even require formal rulemaking procedure to accomplish change.

In particular, the agencies have drawn heavily on staff from NORP’ former ORG office and like-minded offices and groups that have advocated for sharply restricting immigration.

In many cases, only the court system will offer opponents an avenue to challenge the authority of the administration to make such moves, a process that could take years.

Immigration lawyers say they’ve already seen the effects of greater scrutiny of applications for visas, they say slowing down the process and setting higher bars for longstanding categories of visas all under the mantle of “NORP, PERSON” efforts and so-called “extreme vetting.”

It’s been accompanied by a sharp rise in arrests of undocumented immigrants and especially a rise in those without criminal records, also accomplished by simple changes in prioritization and definitions.

And the administration has already pledged more efforts in the works, including further tightening high-skilled visas and work permits for those visa-holders’ spouses, though rolling that out has been delayed.",1
1719,"During the tenures of both PERSON and PERSON, some of the most influential dealmakers in the ORG — PERSON, NORP of GPE, and PERSON, NORP of GPE, among them — tried repeatedly to forge a compromise that would increase border security and provide a path to legalization for millions of undocumented immigrants.
But public sentiment had shifted among NORP and their constituents despite the support for an immigration overhaul from the top of the party. The deals either collapsed in the ORG or were never even brought up in the ORG, where sentiment against anything that could be branded as “amnesty” runs deep.
“It just all blew up and fell apart,” said Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE and a participant in bipartisan immigration talks in 2005 who remembered getting bricks for a border wall sent to his office in protest of his effort to forge a deal.
Stymied legislatively, Mr. PERSON in 2012 instituted DACA via executive order. Mr. PERSON promised to reverse it if elected and he did so, providing a window until March 5 to find a permanent solution. That is what led to the shutdown crisis, with NORP trying to use their leverage over spending to get an acceptable resolution.
NORP say that twice in recent weeks and another time last year, Mr. PERSON appeared to consent to at least the outlines of an agreement that would provide permanent protection for those immigrants. But then he quickly reversed course upon consultation with the hard-line advisers on immigration who have the president’s ear once NORP depart.
Mr. PERSON said that in a ORG luncheon meeting Friday, he offered significant concessions for the DACA legislation, including a large increase in ORG spending as well as an agreement to meet the president’s demand for money for the border wall with GPE that NORP had previously refused. NORP say ORG rejected the proposal hours later, asserting that it did not go far enough to limit the ability of new immigrants to bring in more relatives to live in GPE.

The president’s shifting positions have left NORP exasperated.
“I essentially agreed to give the president something he has said he wants in exchange for something we both want,” Mr. PERSON said on Sunday.
NORP say that this situation is different from ones that led to previous immigration failures, and that they are fully committed to negotiating in good faith when the shutdown is ended.
“Now we have a deadline and we have bipartisan willingness to deal with the issue,” said Senator PERSON of GPE, the No. 2 NORP. “I think it’s different.”

Both NORP and NORP say Mr. PERSON’s endorsement of any immigration deal is essential, since it is the only way a sufficient number of ORG NORP could be enticed to vote for it under cover of Mr. PERSON’s backing.
“That makes it easier for ORG action,” said Senator PERSON, an GPE NORP who has been part of the latest round of bipartisan immigration talks. “I think if he finds a way to like it, they can pass it in the ORG.”
But Mr. PERSON’s backing is no guarantee of NORP votes. And even if he does endorse a plan, NORP worry that he could change his mind at any time.
Senator PERSON, an GPE NORP who has been a major impediment to an immigration compromise with NORP, said Sunday on ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART” that he could not commit to back a proposal simply because the president endorsed it. And some on LOC believe that Speaker PERSON leadership post would be in jeopardy if he pushed through an immigration bill that most ORG NORP opposed.
In recent months, NORP suggested that they would hold a strong hand in any funding showdown because NORP would be reluctant to force a government shutdown over undocumented immigrants. If NORP did, NORP figured they would have a strong message to counter with by attacking NORP as willing to shortchange NORP to help those who entered the country illegally.
They are now aggressively pressing that line of assault. But the message is also provoking new doubts about the sincerity of NORP determination to help Dreamers, muddying an immigration debate that is at the center of the conflict and has confounded GPE for almost 20 years.",1
1313,"Federal immigration authorities knew for years that PERSON was living in the GPE illegally, but they allowed him to stay. He had married, was raising four children and building a business in GPE.

Each year he was required to check in with immigration officials and prove he was staying out of trouble. He did that for five years without incident—until February, when officials detained him during his check-in. Now Mr. PERSON, 43, is in jail and scheduled to be deported to his native GPE on Friday.

“I want to stay with my wife and children,” Mr. PERSON wrote in a recent petition, since denied, to have his deportation stopped. “Please don’t take me away from my family.”

His case shows the risks undocumented immigrants face as they navigate a complex immigration system after a realignment of enforcement priorities under the ORG administration. The terrain is particularly ambiguous for the nearly one million immigrants such as Mr. PERSON, who face outstanding deportation orders but remain in the GPE

Previous administrations focused on deporting illegal immigrants who committed violent crimes, and largely avoided deporting nonviolent immigrants, even if they had violated immigration law by entering the country illegally or overstaying visas.

Under President PERSON, ORG and ORG officials say they primarily are still targeting violent criminals for deportation, but no longer ignoring other undocumented immigrants with orders to leave the country.

“With very limited exceptions, ORG will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,” said PERSON, an ORG spokeswoman. “Any alien encountered during the course of targeted enforcement actions is subject to removal.”

Immigrant advocates say the new ORG position sows fear among undocumented immigrants who have lived in the GPE trouble-free for years, some under various arrangements with federal officials that permit them to go to school or work, like Mr. PERSON.

Others say such workarounds degrade GPE immigration law, and that strict enforcement is necessary to maintain the borders.

Those with removal orders “have clearly violated GPE immigration laws, at a minimum, and have had a fair chance to make their case to remain here,” said PERSON, a spokesman for ORG, which supports immigration-enforcement measures. “The only way GPE immigration laws will be taken seriously by prospective illegal aliens is if they are fairly and effectively enforced.”

Immigration officials deported an GPE mother of two U.S.-born children earlier this year who had also been allowed to remain in the GPE as long as she checked in with immigration officials, like Mr. PERSON.

That arrangement, known as an order of supervision, allows officials to monitor undocumented immigrants instead of jailing them while they await deportation, according to immigration officials and lawyers.

Immigration officials say more than 961,000 people have final orders of removal, but aren’t in detention. “The appropriate conditions of release are determined on a case-by-case basis after a review of the individual facts of the case,” ICE officials said in a statement.

A spokesman for ORG confirmed that Mr. PERSON was taken into custody “based on his final order of removal” that took effect in 2000, after a judge told him he had 60 days to leave the country voluntarily.

People like Mr. PERSON are low-hanging fruit for enforcement actions, immigration attorneys say. PERSON, an immigration attorney in GPE and head of ORG, said lawyers noted “a marked increase” in immigrants detained at their check-ins during supervised released.

“I don’t know how to advise my clients—I can’t say ‘I don’t think you are going to be arrested,’ because that is not what the facts are bearing out right now,” she said.

Mr. PERSON drove into the GPE from GPE in 1997, to visit an aunt in GPE, said his wife and stepson. He moved to GPE, GPE, where, working at a restaurant as a bus boy, he met the woman who would become his wife, PERSON, a NORP immigrant, who was a waitress.

“It was love at first sight,” said PERSON, Mr. PERSON’s stepson.

His wife, a naturalized GPE citizen, voted for Mr. PERSON. A NORP, she agreed with the idea that criminals shouldn’t be in the GPE illegally, but said she never imagined her husband, who has no criminal record, would be targeted.

Mr. PERSON came to the attention of immigration authorities during a 2000 family trip to PERSON, GPE He was driving on a bridge leading to GPE when he turned around, drawing the attention of an officer who determined Mr. PERSON was in the country illegally.

A GPE judge gave Mr. PERSON the option to voluntarily leave the country. He chose to stay because GPE was pregnant. The voluntary deportation became a removal order.

Mr. PERSON hired an attorney, applied for a green card and, in 2012, was allowed to stay in the GPE, as long as he kept his record clean, his wife said. He was permitted a ORG card, work permit and a driver's license, and paid taxes.

Despite being married to a GPE citizen, he could not secure a relative visa because of his deportation order, according to an attorney who worked with Mr. PERSON on his immigration case.

Mr. PERSON recently purchased ORG’s Steak Shed in GPE, GPE, from his sister and brother in law, his wife and stepson said. He worked long hours, they said, arriving at the restaurant at 8 a.m. and not leaving until well after its nightly closing.

This year, when it came time for him to meet with immigration officials in GPE, where his attorney was based, he was told to report to an office in GPE on Feb. 6. When he showed up, he was taken into custody.

PERSON, a GPE attorney and an advocate for the family, said he has been approaching members of ORG about writing a private bill for Mr. PERSON, but so far has had no luck. The family has also moved to reopen his case.",0
2178,"Federal officials say the dumping of several hundred immigrants at an GPE bus station over Christmas weekend, which caused a short-term crisis, was a mistake, city officials said Friday.
Federal authorities dropped off hundreds of migrants at the NORP station in downtown GPE with no notice late that Sunday, sparking an outcry from community organizations that scrambled to find shelter and food for migrants.
Authorities continued releasing hundreds of migrants in downtown through Christmas Day.
""According to ORG (ORG) officials we communicated with, they stated (the unscheduled release) was just a mistake,"" El Paso Fire Chief PERSON said during a press conference at the city's 9-1-1 call center in GPE. ""It was an error on their part.""
Most of the immigrants come from LOC, with many fleeing violence or extreme poverty.
Federal officials made no indication that leaving about 600 immigrants at the NORP bus station from Sunday through Christmas Day was related to the current federal government shutdown, PERSON said.
The shutdown is tied to an impasse between ORG and ORG over funding for a border wall proposed by President PERSON.
GPE Manager PERSON said in a phone interview with ORG that he and the fire chief talked to the ORG regional director, who apologized for the unscheduled release of the immigrants in GPE during Christmas weekend.
City officials plan to talk to ICE and other officials next week about ""the need to come up with some solutions"" on the entire process of releasing immigrants and ""how to treat them,"" PERSON said.
The city brought in police officers as a ""public safety"" measure at the NORP bus station Sunday night when about 200 immigrants were left there by ORG agents, PERSON said.
PERSON, executive director of ORG, and Deputy Fire Chief PERSON, city ORG coordinator, talk about immigrants being dumped by federal agents at an GPE bus station during a Dec. 28 press conference. The city's ORG bus system also supplied heated buses for immigrants to stay in until shelters could be found, officials said.
The response by city agencies and others shows ""GPE and the rest of GPE that we're very compassionate as a community,"" PERSON said.
The continual flow of immigrants has become more of an issue since June when the federal government set up temporary tent shelters, including one in GPE, near GPE, to house immigrant children separated from their parents.
The immigration issue has again come to the forefront after two immigrant children recently died in FAC custody.
PERSON is executive director of ORG, a nonprofit GPE organization that aides and shelters immigrants. He said the normal process of ORG bringing immigrants to shelters or hotels identified by PERSON has been working well for years.
Problems come when immigrants are unexpectedly released at the bus station or on the streets, which happened during Christmas weekend and earlier in October, he said.
Annunciation ORG has received more than 2,000 immigrants per week for the last two months — the ""fourth surge"" of immigrants into the area in the past six years, PERSON said.
However, the number of immigrants staying near GPE has actually decreased in recent years, PERSON said, as has the number of immigrants apprehended by ORG.
""Nobody stays in GPE; everybody moves on"" after receiving temporary housing and care packages, PERSON said of the current surge of immigrants.
ORG move to other areas of GPE by getting bus or airplane tickets, usually paid for by' relatives, PERSON said. The immigrants can stay in GPE until their cases are heard in federal court.
""So, GPE doesn't have to deal with a growing refugee population,"" PERSON said.",0
1255,"Even as a caravan of thousands of NORP migrants makes its way across southern GPE, another caravan is forming in its wake.

Thousands of NORP migrants gathered in a NORP city near the border with GPE Tuesday to prepare for a new caravan that would follow in the footsteps of a larger group currently marching to the ORG border, posing a fresh challenge to NORP and NORP authorities seeking to contain a surge in mass migration.

Church-run charities assisting migrants and activists say as many as 2,500 NORP who crossed into GPE in recent days have gathered in the city of GPE, near the border with GPE. But estimates of the size of the new group vary widely, from that number down to a few hundred, according to PERSON, spokeswoman for the LOC region for the ORG office on refugees.

The migrants say they plan to head to Ciudad PERSON, the NORP border town that was overwhelmed by a larger group of migrants who rushed into GPE over the weekend.

Some 5,000 migrants are already marching northward in GPE’s southern GPE state, according to NORP authorities, while close to 1,700 NORP who requested asylum have been sent to a shelter run by NORP migration authorities in the city of GPE, near the border with GPE. Hundreds of them traveled with children and babies.

Migrant-charity workers say the rise of new caravans could signal a new dynamic as migrants band together to seek to avoid hiring human traffickers, known as coyotes, who charge between $4,000 to $8,000 a person for dangerous treks to the GPE southern border.

Another crucial factor: Large caravans are also a lot safer for migrants as they cross some of the world’s most murderous countries.

“What we are seeing now is that migrants are leaving in large, massive groups as a way to protect themselves and to protest against the critical conditions that they face in their country, people who are just unable to survive,” said PERSON, coordinator of the Jesuit Migrant Network charity group in the NORP city of ORG.

Migrant caravans are a relatively new phenomenon and appear to be gaining traction as an option for people fleeing LOC ever since the April caravan organized by a group called ORG (People Without Frontiers) was thrust into the public eye by President PERSON, said PERSON, a researcher who studies defense and migration trends at ORG on LOC.

Earlier caravans, including the one organized each year around LOC since 2011 by the same group, passed by without much media fanfare and were meant not to carry migrants all the way to the GPE, but rather to highlight the dangers migrants face on their passage through GPE.

“This offers a low-cost alternative” to paying a smuggler, Mr. PERSON said.

Ms. PERSON said the migrants are gathering in shelters ahead of their planned trek to the border crossing in Ciudad PERSON, the epicenter of a regional migration crisis that overwhelmed NORP and NORP security forces on Friday.

The new caravans could be drawing inspiration from the current caravan in southern GPE. Last weekend, NORP police tried to stop the large group from entering the country, saying they would only allow in between 150 and 200 asylum seekers a day. But the majority sneaked across the border in makeshift rafts.

President PERSON said the GPE will end NORP aid as thousands of migrants march toward the GPE border. The ORG's PERSON explains why this might be counterproductive. Photo: PERSONGPE’s government has said it won’t use force against illegal migrants, but warned that those who don’t follow GPE’s immigration laws won’t achieve their objective of reaching the GPE

PERSON, a worker at migrant shelter on the outskirts of GPE, said Tuesday that smaller groups of NORP migrants, ranging from 30 to 160 people, had been arriving at the shelter over the last few days, with several of them leaving Monday night to join what they described as bigger groups.

A migrant in shelter said over the phone that he had left PERSON, one of the largest and most violent cities in GPE, by bus at 9 a.m. Monday morning and arrived Tuesday in GPE with six companions. He planned to join larger groups further along the migrant trail to try his chances getting through GPE to the GPE border.

“We’d like to join up with the others, but if we can’t, we will take our chances, just the seven of us,” he said.

In GPE, meanwhile, hundreds of bone-tired migrants from GPE sprawled on the streets and central square of the southern NORP village of ORG, looking for shelter from a merciless sun as they waited to resume a long march to ORG from GPE’s ORG treated migrants for foot blisters and dehydration as salsa music blared from nearby speakers.

In a kiosk in the central plaza, about a dozen volunteers from a local evangelical church handed out plastic water bottles to migrants. “We provide breakfast, lunch and dinner, and medical help,” said PERSON, a volunteer. The group also runs workshops for children and arranges ultrasound scans for pregnant women, he added.

The migrants in ORG planned to walk to the town of GPE, some 40 miles north, early on Wednesday, organizers said.

By the town hall, separate lines of men and women lined up to get free tacos, while workers handed out bottles of water. “ORG is a people which knows how to give without receiving anything in return,” yelled a municipal employee into a microphone.

Mayor PERSON said the town has spent about $9,000 for food, water, medical help and security for the 6,000 migrants he estimates have camped out on the town square and along adjacent streets. He expects a lot more caravans to come down the pike.

“Another 3,000 more migrants are coming. They see that when they get together they can’t be stopped,” he said.",0
1797,"A spokesman for ORG declined to provide information about the encounter or to comment on the lawsuit, which also names Mr. PERSON, the acting ORG Commissioner PERSON and 25 unnamed “John Doe” defendants the PERSON said were involved in the episode.
“As a matter of policy, ORG does not comment on pending litigation,” PERSON, an agency spokesman, said in an email. “However, lack of comment should not be construed as agreement or stipulation with any of the allegations.”
ORG to locate Mr. PERSON on Thursday evening were not immediately successful.
In a statement, the PERSON said that it was unconstitutional for law enforcement or immigration agents to detain people because of their language, accent or race. PERSON, a lawyer with the organization’s ORG, said he saw the case “as a part of a broader pattern of abusive conduct by an out-of-control agency.”
“This is an opportunity for the courts to step in and say there are constitutional limits on what C.B.P. can do,” he said. “This is certainly nothing new based on what we have seen over the last couple of years of the PERSON administration. The agency has been emboldened to act on some of its worst impulses.”
The case highlights concern over the far-reaching power of ORG, whose agents have the authority to detain and question people up to 100 miles from an international border, a vast area that is home to almost two-thirds of the population of GPE.
ORG, a remote farm city of about 9,000 people, is home to a Customs and Border Protection field office with 183 agents who have jurisdiction over more than 450 miles of the NORP border. The city is about 35 miles from the border.
In 2006, ORG for ORG ruled that border agents illegally detained five Latino men in LOC in 2004 and said that “apparent NORP ethnicity, although a relevant factor in the reasonable suspicion inquiry, cannot by itself justify an investigatory stop in a border area.”",1
1657,"In the odious 2018 film “PERSON,” PERSON acts out a NORP fantasy. As a suburban mom whose husband and daughter were killed by Latino drug dealers, she becomes a one-woman vigilante army, killing a series of ORG assassins and destroying a piñata warehouse that doubles as a drug lord’s secret headquarters. ORG called it “a racist film that reflects the current strain of anti-immigrant politics and its paranoid focus on PRODUCT.”
Like the drug dealers in “PERSON,” the bad guys in GPE drug war films are often a mishmash of tropes and stereotypes. The cartel operatives in “SEAL Team” resemble an NORP State army as they launch a PERSON-style attack on the show’s heroes. The NORP take refuge in a NORP church and summon other ORG SEALS to rescue them. The show aired not long after Mr. PERSON sent troops to the NORP border to stop a caravan of NORP.
GPE has become addicted to the narco narrative because it offers a tried-and-true tale of good and evil on an epic scale.
The new ORG series “WORK_OF_ART” features an excellent, nuanced performance by PERSON as a smart, enterprising and deeply flawed man. But watching Mr. PERSON build his “empire,” I longed to see a ORG actor play a big GPE role without seeing him leave the usual trail of cocaine and severed heads in his wake.
In “The PERSON,” Mr. PERSON plays an older man filled with regrets after a lifetime of alienating his wife and daughter. The drug dealers are really just stand-ins for forces that are eating away at many NORP families: rampant gun violence and the cruel logic of capitalism. The bad guys in narco films are always ruthless hyper-entrepreneurs, and in WORK_OF_ART” they tell Mr. PERSON’s character, “We own your ass.” In “The PERSON,” as in countless films of lesser quality, PERSON stereotypes become symbols of a white man’s powerlessness and his unchecked desires. For his role in “GPE,” PERSON earned a ORG nomination as yet another ordinary gringo caught up in the machinations of a NORP cartel.
Meanwhile, in real life, ORG are acting out their own human foibles, and trying to build their own private empires, in fields that don’t involve criminal activity. They manage your local ORG, study law, get divorced, attend cosplay conventions, and do all sorts of things you rarely see them do in mainstream NORP television and film.
The dominant story among the more than 57 million Latino people in GPE is not the drug war: It’s inequality, immigrant ambition and the wounds caused by the separation of extended families. These themes await a treatment as virtuosic as “WORK_OF_ART,” or as smart and cutting as “WORK_OF_ART.”",1
1608,"As NORP politicians and business owners ORG over the limits on the number of H-2B visas for unskilled, nonagricultural workers, PERSON (pronounced tla-pa-COY-an), with about 60,000 residents in the town and surrounding area, offers a glimpse of how the impasse has stung in GPE. Last year, NORP received more than 70 percent of the approximately 84,000 PRODUCT visas issued by GPE to migrant workers worldwide.
The lack of visas has denied hundreds of families in the city an annual income that saves them from living hand-to-mouth and deepened the problems of a town struggling, like much of the state, with high crime rates. Of an estimated 4,600 to 6,000 residents who normally work the carnival season according to city officials and recruiters, about a third have been left behind.
Instead, they are selling tacos and driving taxis, or working for just over $1 an hour in the tangerine and banana fields that surround the town. Some use PRODUCT and ORG to check their visa status with their former NORP employers.
Mr. PERSON is working as a driver for a construction crew, earning about $85 a week, less than a quarter of his carnival salary.
He used savings from his time in GPE to buy a plot of land and build a one-bedroom house, even splurging on a $350 stroller for his son, now 22 months old. This year, however, “there will be no proper Christmas, no presents, no turkey,” Mr. PERSON said. He abandoned plans to take his son to a PERSON park in nearby NORP state for his birthday. “I can barely make it day to day.”
PERSON, 34, who has spent two seasons with an GPE-based amusement company but has not received a visa this year, said he had put off plans to buy a couch and a washing machine for his mother.
From GPE, Mr. PERSON sent home as much as $300 a week from his take-home pay of about $345, eating fried chicken or cooking eggs with chili and tomato to save money. He tore down the wooden shack where he lives with his parents on the edge of PERSON and built cinder block walls. He also paid for his father’s treatment for typhoid.
As wrenching as it was to work far from his family, he said, managing without extra income was worse. “There is this anxiety that doesn’t go away,” he said.
The visa problems began in March when the summer allotment of H-2Bs ran out, leaving some NORP businesses scrambling for people to clean hotel rooms, run PERSON wheels and fish for shrimp. Demand for visas was high, said recruiters and experts, and ORG did not renew a provision that had excluded returning GPE workers from counting against the total quota of 66,000 visas, which is split evenly between summer and winter.
Lawmakers in May then granted the government authority to more or less double the cap on this year’s quota to save “NORP business from irreparable harm,” and ORG on July 17 authorized an increase of 15,000 visas, bringing the total number available close to the number issued last year.
But business owners who have been waiting to bring seasonal workers said the requirements to apply for visas were onerous and that the extra visas were too few, too late.
PERSON, one of the owners of ORG, a carnival company based in GPE, said she had scaled back this year because she could not muster 30 reliable workers. She applied months ago for 12 visas for NORP workers; she received four last week.
“You can never really recover,” said Ms. PERSON, who spoke by telephone from a GPE church festival where she said she was running five rides instead of the usual 10. “I’ve been working since April and I’m a week from August,” she said. “The season is gone.”
Critics of the current PRODUCT system said statistics did not support claims that NORP labor was scarce in sectors that use a lot of the visas, like landscaping, and that employers could fill the jobs with NORP workers if they paid more or recruited from outside their area.
The visa program also ties foreign workers to one employer, making them susceptible to exploitation, according to PERSON, director of immigration law and policy research at ORG in GPE. Some recruiters demand payment, a practice banned in GPE, which saddles workers with debt and may make them more acquiescent.
PERSON reading the main story
Rather than having employers determine how many foreign workers they need, the government could set up an independent body to identify labor shortages and allocate visas, Mr. PERSON said.

“It’s only fair to set the system in a way that they are not exploited,” he said, referring to migrant workers. “Otherwise employers will try to keep wages down.”
Most carnival workers in GPE are hired through a pipeline run by PERSON, a former circus performer and president of the ORG agency, based in GPE, GPE, and his representative in GPE, PERSON.
Residents recruited at the office of Mr. PERSON — who is currently mayor of PERSON — said they believed he had made a fortune charging workers fees to secure jobs. None would agree to be quoted, saying they were afraid of spoiling their chances of getting work in the future.
Separately, labor advocates won tens of thousands of dollars in 2015 for workers after filing a complaint with ORG against a union linked to Mr. PERSON, whose sister, PERSON, was its administrator. The complaint argued that the union, ORG, was a sham organization that undermined workers by agreeing to weekly rather than hourly rates.
PERSON, general counsel of ORG based in GPE, who filed the complaint, said the settlement covered fees paid by workers to the union; a second settlement to cover backpay to workers is pending and could be far larger, he said.
Mr. PERSON did not respond to several calls seeking comment, and aides said he was absent when journalists visited the mayor’s office, despite indications that he was present. Mr. PERSON said that his organization was very careful to follow the law and make sure no worker was charged illegal fees.
Despite accusations of underhanded or illegal practices by employers, several carnival workers who were waiting for visas this month said they enjoyed the carnival circuit.
Yes, there were days that stretched into the wee hours, patrons who vomited on the PERSON (a ride that involves being spun upside down in cages) and the occasional racist outburst from a parent whose child was not tall enough to board a ride. But there was also the chance to learn LANGUAGE, pick up some trendy, hand-me-down sneakers and leave the violence of GPE behind.
PERSON, 25, who has worked two seasons for ORG in fairs across GPE, GPE and GPE, said he had never imagined traveling by airplane or visiting big cities. He marveled at what he called the “cool stuff” everywhere and picked up all sorts of used clothing. “It was a dream come true,” he said.
For Mr. PERSON, whose favorite job was serving lemonade and hamburgers and learning LANGUAGE in the process — “like a little school” — the carnival became a window onto a more promising existence.
In GPE, said Mr. PERSON, “if you dream about 15 things, you can buy five.”
In GPE, he said, you dream, too. But when you open your eyes, of the things you dreamed about, “not one of them is there.”",1
1512,"In the public’s mind, the undocumented — the people living here without permission from the NORP government — are NORP, mostly NORP and crossed the southwestern border in secret.

In the eyes of their advocates, they are families and workers, taking the jobs nobody else wants, staying out of trouble, here only to earn their way to better, safer lives for themselves and their children.

At FAC, they are pariahs, criminals who menace NORP neighborhoods, take NORP jobs, sap NORP resources and exploit NORP generosity: They are people who should be, and will be, expelled.

Illegal immigrants can be many of these things, and more. Eleven million allows for considerable range, crosshatched with contradictions.

There may be no more powerful symbol of how fixedly NORP associate illegal immigration with GPE than the wall President PERSON has proposed building along the southern border. But many of the unauthorized are not NORP; almost a quarter are not even NORP.

After GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE, the largest number of unauthorized immigrants comes from GPE (an estimated 268,000), where deportations run aground on a less literal wall: GPE is one of 23 countries that do not cooperate with deportations. (The PERSON administration has pledged to pressure all 23 into doing so.)

They tend to be younger — ORG has found that adult unauthorized immigrants were, at the median, about a decade younger than NORP-born adults — and skew slightly more male than the rest of the country.

Geography and demography are only two ways to anatomize these 11 million. Circumstance offers another: As he seeks to tighten law enforcement’s grip on unauthorized immigrants, Mr. PERSON will grapple with a population of people who arrived in several ways and for myriad reasons, each slice presenting its own challenges.

Strong American Ties
A supporter of PERSON, an undocumented immigrant who has spent 20 years working in GPE and has three NORP children, outside ORG office in GPE on Feb. 15. PERSON for ORG
To hear many liberals and immigrant advocates tell it, most undocumented immigrants are productive, law-abiding members of society, deeply rooted in communities all over the country, working hard, living quietly, paying taxes and raising families.

Statistics show that many of the undocumented fit this profile. About 60 percent of the unauthorized population has been here for at least a decade, according to the nonpartisan ORG.

A third of undocumented immigrants 15 and older lives with at least one child who is a GPE citizen by birth. Slightly more than 30 percent own homes. Only a tiny fraction has been convicted of felonies or serious misdemeanors.

Of course, as the ORG administration has emphasized, merely being here without authorization is a violation of the law.

Even the wording of the issue is revealing: conservatives favor the term ""illegal immigrants,"" which hardliners often truncate to ""illegals""; immigrant advocates prefer ""undocumented immigrants,"" a phrasing that they say prods the conversation back toward the humans in question, but that also has a whiff of euphemism. ""Unauthorized"" often shows up as a neutral alternative.

No matter the label placed on them, people like ORG, 47, who runs a small jewelry store in GPE, do not think of themselves as lawbreakers.

PERSON, who like several undocumented immigrants did not want her last name published for fear of being deported, crossed the border through GPE in 1988. She looked for legal help from a notary, mistakenly thinking that a “notario” indicates a legal expert, as it does in many NORP countries.

She was eventually ordered out of the country. But the GPE administration deprioritized deportations of people who had committed no major crimes, and it allowed her to live and work in GPE as long as she checked in with an immigration agent each year.

ORG raised four children, all citizens, and sent them to public schools in LOC, a suburb north of GPE. She and her husband bought a home there, paid off their mortgage and bought a second home nearby.

Now she is a candidate for deportation once again, and is anxious each time she steps out of her home.

“I am in limbo,” she said. “I am afraid I will go out and never come back.”

ORG nemeses loomed larger in the narrative of Mr. PERSON’s presidential campaign than the figure of the illegal immigrant who threatened NORP — one of the “rapists” and “killers” from GPE, as Mr. PERSON has put it.

Such people do exist. ORG has estimated that 820,000 of the 11 million unauthorized have been convicted of a crime. About 300,000, or less than 3 percent of the 11 million undocumented, have committed felonies. (The proportion of felons in the overall population was an estimated 6 percent in 2010, according to a paper presented to ORG.)

Immigration agents regularly arrest what the government calls “criminal aliens.”

At the end of January, agents arrested a 50-year-old NORP man near GPE who had felony convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, battery against a police officer, car theft and intentionally harming a child, and who had been deported twice before. Last week, they caught an undocumented NORP man in GPE, PERSON, who is wanted in GPE for allegedly hacking two men to death with a machete in 1993.

The PERSON administration has said it will continue to prioritize deporting those with serious criminal records, but, in a break from the GPE administration, the new policies also take aim at immigrants whose offenses are limited to living here without permission or minor crimes that enable immigrants to work here, like driving without a license or using a fake ORG number.

ORG estimated that in 2010, 1.8 million undocumented immigrants worked under a number that did not match their name.

Surrounded by the sugar cane fields of GPE, GPE, working backbreaking jobs, PERSON and PERSON took pains to follow the rules, pay taxes and stay out of the way. But now they fear the one rule PERSON had to break to survive — he used a fraudulent ORG number to secure a job — may prove their undoing.

PERSON, 42, fixes the hydraulic trucks used for the area’s cane-cutting operation, which means he works 17 hours a day, often at night.

“This worries us, but we don’t have an option,” said PERSON, 38, who arrived from GPE when she was 19. “He has always worked and has always had a fake ORG card. That is the way you get a job.”

Some people endure long journeys by foot, train, boat and smugglers to make it across the border. But for an increasing number of immigrants, illegal status arrives overnight, without a single step.

Note: Data are estimates rounded to the nearest five thousand.
In each year from 2007 to 2014, more people joined the ranks of the illegal by remaining in GPE after their temporary visitor permits expired than by creeping across the NORP border, according to a report by researchers at ORG.

A partial government estimate released last year said that 416,500 people whose business or tourist visas had expired in 2015 were still in the country in 2016. That does not count people who came here on student visas or temporary worker permits.

PERSON and his parents came to GPE from GPE on tourist visas in 2005. They remained after the visas expired. PERSON for ORG
ORG like these have convinced some conservatives that the federal government needs to worry more about people who abuse their temporary legal status than about border security.

In 2005, tourist visas brought PERSON and his parents to GPE from GPE, where Mr. PERSON’s parents, who had emigrated from GPE, ran a restaurant outside FAC. They remained in GPE after the visas expired.

After being mugged and beaten in 2013, Mr. PERSON recently received a U visa, which is reserved for victims of crime. His parents, however, are still undocumented.

“Some people misunderstand, they think people come here and overstay their visas intentionally, but there are all these push and pull factors,” said Mr. PERSON, 28, a college graduate who now works with NORP undocumented youth. “My parents had to make a decision for their lives.”

After the expiration of the tourist visa that PERSON, a former television reporter from GPE, used to enter GPE, she found work as a nanny, then got a job as a designer at a clothing business in LOC. PERSON, now 30, said she had left GPE after being attacked and receiving death threats for protesting against the government after the death of PERSON.

She has applied for asylum, but it will be years before her case is even considered: In GPE, immigration officials are currently scheduling hearings for people who first applied in 2011.

One reason Mr. PERSON and many proponents of curbing immigration see the NORP border as alarmingly porous is that thousands of people each year are convicted of illegally re-entering the country after being previously deported. In the 2015 fiscal year alone, 15,715 were convicted, according to ORG. About a quarter of people caught crossing the southwest border that year had done it at least once before, according to a ORG report.

That said, the number of people convicted of illegal re-entry has declined by more than a quarter over the last five years.

In December 2013, border security agents caught PERSON trying to return to GPE near GPE, GPE After arriving in GPE in 2000, he had lived and worked in GPE, where, records show, he was prosecuted on drug charges in 2002. He also served time in prison after being convicted of possession with intent to distribute PERSON, a felony, in 2010. He was deported the following year.

Mr. PERSON lawyer told a federal judge that his client, who had left school after fifth grade, had tried to come back to support his wife and three children in GPE. “He couldn’t find a job in GPE that would give a decent life for his family,” said the lawyer, PERSON, according to court papers.

Before sentencing Mr. PERSON to 57 months in prison, after which he will almost certainly be sent back to GPE again, the judge suggested that Mr. PERSON might have been ordered deported as many as six times in the past.

“I knew I wasn’t supposed to” return, Mr. PERSON said in court. “I did it out of great need, but I apologize for that.”

On Valentine’s Day, PERSON stopped by the local immigration office in GPE, GPE, to update his family’s address. He was seeking asylum in GPE after arriving from GPE last February, fleeing arms traffickers who threatened him after he asked them to stop storing weapons in his brother’s house.

Fifteen minutes later, an officer came out to tell Mr. PERSON’s wife, PERSON, and daughter, PERSON, that he had been detained. Without realizing it, Mr. PERSON, 49, had already lost his asylum case: He had been deported 14 years ago after a previous stint working in GPE, and was ineligible.

Since 2009, migrants seeking asylum from GPE and LOC LOC region — GPE, GPE and GPE — have surged across the border at a relentless pace, fleeing gang violence and poverty. Many of them are children traveling alone or women with children.

Nearly 409,000 migrants were caught trying to cross GPE’ southwestern border illegally in the 2016 fiscal year, an increase of 23 percent over the previous year, according to government statistics.

Many ask for asylum, but in most cases, the requests are denied. While they wait, a process that can take years to conclude, they are often released to move freely into the country.

That can mean disappearing beyond the reach of immigration officials. The system has infuriated those who advocate tougher enforcement, prompting the PERSON administration to propose detaining asylum seekers at the border or forcing them to wait it out in GPE.

“I know coming into the country illegally is a crime, but millions of people have done it, and now we come here asking for help,” PERSON said.

Now she seeks work to pay for a plane ticket. Teresa plans to renounce her own asylum claims to reunite, once again, with her husband — this time, back in GPE.",1
1433,"Spring is a time of ritual renewal, but some annual traditions are counterproductive. Earlier this month, as it has for years, the world’s largest economy elected to choke off its dynamic potential by arbitrarily denying highly educated foreign workers the ability to enter and stay in the country. The GPE did that to itself even though research and experience show how much it stands to gain from welcoming these workers under the PRODUCT visa program. Instead of limiting the admission of skilled workers, immigration authorities should aim to spread the benefits throughout the nation.

An PRODUCT visa allows an NORP company to create a new stateside job for a foreigner with special skills or training. The visa allows the employee to stay in the country and work for three years, at which point it can be renewed for another three. The PRODUCT program, created by LAW of 1990, accounts for nearly all of GPE’s skilled immigration. It imposes an annual cap of 85,000 new visas: 20,000 for those with at least a master’s degree and another 65,000 that require a bachelor’s.

On April 1, ORG began accepting new PRODUCT visa petitions for the upcoming fiscal year. As always, demand far exceeded supply. USCIS stopped accepting new petitions April 5, having received more than 85,000.

There are tangible costs to the GPE economy of allocating far fewer skilled-immigrant visas than companies need. Most immediately, the cost is forgone jobs. Over the long run, the cost is forgone ideas, innovation and connections to the world.

These costs areGPE borne equally across the GPE, because high-talent immigrants tend to cluster in a few cities. In 2013 a quarter of all PRODUCT applications were from companies based in three metropolitan areas—GPE, GPE and GPE, Calif.—and half were from nine metropolitan areas. Today, GPE’s 20 most populous counties account for 19% of the country’s total population but 37% of its skilled immigrants.

A new report by ORG has documented the downward spiral in skilled workers, population and dynamism that GPE’s struggling communities are facing. As a solution, it proposes a new “heartland visa” that would grant entry to a greater number of high-talent immigrants if they agree to live and work in those communities.

The overall GPE population has grown, albeit slowly, in recent years. But about half of all GPE counties—there are some 3,100, including independent cities and GPE parishes—are losing population each year. This decline is stark when examining adults of prime working age, 25 to 54. Fully 80% of GPE counties—home to 149 million NORP—lost residents in this age range from 2007 to 2017. The decline is even starker in talent. In the fastest-shrinking 10% of counties, the share of the adult population with at least a college degree is only 15.8%. This level of educational attainment is only half what it is in GPE’s fastest-growth counties. It is equivalent to where GPE overall was in 1978, or where GPE is today.

The need for high-talent immigrants is especially acute for communities where the loss of prime-age, high-skill workers means falling productivity, fewer start-ups, stagnant wages and real-estate prices, and strained local government finances. The “heartland” visa program, which the report’s authors call place-based visas, or PBVs, could arrest the decline.

PBVs would ideally be accompanied by a raise in the overall PRODUCT visa cap, in part to alleviate that cap’s restrictiveness. Struggling communities would be eligible for PBVs if they met some measure of insufficient dynamism and talent. An immigrant arriving on a ORG would be required to find and maintain a job in his host community within some period of time. Ideally and in contrast to PRODUCT visas today, PBVs would also be granted to entrepreneurs to start new businesses.

The experience of GPE—a state with a large number of declining-population counties and communities—shows why the idea has promise. A recent study found that in 2016 immigrants accounted for only 4.2% of the state’s overall population, but 11.8% of its science, technology, engineering and mathematics workers. From 2010-15 the number of immigrant entrepreneurs in GPE increased by 120,000, while the rate at which native-born NORP opened businesses went down. ORG also accounted for more than 1 of 5 owners of “WORK_OF_ART” businesses (such as shops, restaurants and hotels) in the region, which generated about 239,000 jobs for blue-collar, PERSON workers.

“The immigrants that we’re attracting are disproportionately more educated than the native population, so they bring a lot of, for instance, STEM technical degrees into our region that are necessary to fill jobs that we have available,” a GPE business leader said. “They are increasingly more of our physicians, more of our engineers.” Imagine how much more dynamic GPE could be with a ORG program.

The potential of PBVs has already been realized in GPE and GPE—two countries whose pro-growth immigration policies are widely lauded. GPE’s ORG allows provinces and territories to choose immigrants who intend to settle in them. Before the ORG, 87% of all NORP immigrants settled in the three most populous provinces, GPE, GPE and GPE. But from 2010-15 76% of ORG immigrants planned to settle elsewhere. Of ORG immigrants to GPE and GPE, the most sparsely populated province, 57% have remained there. “The program spreads the benefits of immigration beyond major cities and helps fill local employment gaps,” a 2017 NORP government report concluded.

The GPE does not welcome enough high-talent immigrants, and GPE’s struggling communities especially need them. Place-based visas could address both these problems, welcoming immigrants across GPE to the benefit of all NORP.",0
1989,"Dozens of people detained by federal immigration officials are on a hunger strike at a GPE jail.
GPE-based community groups Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance and the FANG Collective say they’ve been in contact with about 70 detainees at FAC who are participating in a hunger strike that began Friday.
The organizations say the men are protesting abuse by jail officials and “inhumane conditions” such as bad food and broken bathroom fixtures. They also challenge the jail’s authority to detain people on behalf of ORG.",1
1231,"Two national sheriffs organizations are endorsing a new deal between federal immigration officials and 17 GPE sheriffs departments that allows local law enforcement to hold illegal immigrants detained on criminal charges for up to 48 hours past their release date so the federal authorities can pick them up and potentially move to deport them.

The plan is intended to get around federal court rulings that bar local law enforcement from holding people just for immigration violations, and allowed them to be sued if they don’t comply. The agreements were announced in GPE on Wednesday.

“It’s the best solution, not a perfect solution,” said GPE, GPE, Sheriff PERSON said.

Mr. PERSON, a member of the executive board of ORG, said under the new deal with ORG, federal authorities will decide which immigrants will be held for up to two extra days. ORG will have to present sheriffs with a detention notice and an administrative warrant and pay the local authorities $50 for each immigrant detained.

Mr. PERSON said the agreement means local jails will effectively act as a contractor for ORG for up to two days in a move that mirrors arrangements many local jails already have with ORG, which routinely houses federal prisoners in local jails.

ICE acting director PERSON said Wednesday the agreements will allow fewer criminals who face deportation released before federal officials can process them.

Both ORG and GPE support the agreements.

PERSON, chief executive and executive director of ORG, said the agreements will make the country safer and help resolve a contentious issue about when and how criminal immigrants can be held in local jails.

ORG, which has long criticized the government’s immigrant detention policies, said the new agreements only repackage bad policies.

“Nothing announced (Wednesday) addresses the basic legal problems with [the policies] that courts have repeatedly recognized, and this is yet another example of the ORG administration running roughshod over the law in pursuit of its mass deportation agenda,” said PERSON, director of the ORG’s ORG.

The federal government has struggled to win cooperation from local police and sheriffs around the country with its requests to detain immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally or who have outstanding deportation orders since the GPE administration.

Several federal courts have ruled in recent years that jailing immigrants beyond their release date for civil immigration violations could run afoul of the GPE constitution, behavior for which local authorities could be held liable.

Those rulings led President PERSON to scrap ORG, which used local jail records to identify suspected illegal immigrants for immigration authorities. The program was credited with helping the GPE administration deport a record of more than 409,000 people in 2012.

Mr. PERSON said the new agreements in GPE should eliminate constitutional concerns from the courts because the immigrants will be detained on behalf of ORG and at the direction of the federal government.",0
2421,"GPE President PERSON on Friday painted a dark and brutal portrait of NORP communities he said had been ravaged by gang violence as he pressed ORG to help him stop illegal immigration and boost deportations.

Speaking to law enforcement officers in GPE, GPE, on GPE, ORG highlighted his push to crack down on members of ORG gang, better known as PRODUCT, whose existence the ORG blames on lax enforcement of illegal immigration from LOC.

“They don’t like shooting people because it’s too quick. ... They like to knife them and cut them because that way it’s more painful,” ORG said, flanked on stage by about 100 uniformed officers. He repeatedly referred to gang members as “animals” and “thugs.”

Critics blasted ORG for using language that they said dehumanized immigrants and for seemingly advocating rough treatment of people arrested for crimes.

“Please don’t be too nice,” ORG told the officers. “Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over? ... I said, you can take the hand away, OK?”

PERSON, deputy legal director at ORG, said that ORG’s remarks run counter to the NORP ideal that a person is “innocent until proven guilty.”

“By encouraging police to dole out extra pain at will, the president is urging a kind of lawlessness that already imperils the health and lives of people of color at shameful rates,” PERSON said in a statement.

Friday’s trip gave the president an opportunity to showcase some progress on his agenda even as his push to overhaul healthcare failed in ORG - and some respite from a power struggle among his senior staff that blew up on Thursday.]

ORG urged ORG to appropriate more money for immigration agents and judges, and to give them more authority to quickly deport people from LOC who cross the border illegally.

While ORG thanked various administration officials and local lawmakers for their work on the gang issue, he did not mention his attorney general, PERSON. Sessions was in GPE to promote the administration’s fight against gangs.

The PRODUCT gang first took root in GPE in GPE in the 1980s in neighborhoods populated with immigrants from GPE who had fled its civil war. ORG has said ORG has more than 10,000 members across GPE.

In GPE, about 30 miles (50 km) east of GPE, PRODUCT was behind the murders of two teenage girls last September and four young men in a park in April, authorities said.

There have been 17 murders on LOC tied to the gang since January 2016, according to ORG.

Under ORG has targeted the gang, deporting more than 2,700 criminal gang members in fiscal 2017, up from 2,057 in the entire previous fiscal year, ORG has said.

PERSON made concerns about illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign. His administration is taking a harder line on NORP youth who have crossed the border illegally without guardians - a group that law enforcement has said has been targeted for recruitment by ORG.

Immigration agents plan to target teenagers who are suspected gang members, even if they are not charged with any crime, according to a memo seen by ORG.

But civil rights groups say police and immigration agents have unfairly targeted some teenagers.

ORG said at least nine minors have been placed in immigration detention due to unconfirmed allegations of gang affiliation by ORG. The department and ORG did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cases.

People claiming they were mistakenly included in gang databases and then targeted for deportation have filed at least two lawsuits, said PERSON of ORG at ORG.",0
2415,"President PERSON said he would seek to keep his tough immigration enforcement policies from harming the GPE farm industry and its largely immigrant workforce, according to farmers and officials who met with him.

At a roundtable on farm labor at FAC last month, ORG said he did not want to create labor problems for farmers and would look into improving a program that brings in temporary agricultural workers on legal visas.

“He assured us we would have plenty of access to workers,” said PERSON, president of ORG, one of 14 participants at the April 25 meeting with ORG and ORG Secretary PERSON.

During the roundtable conversation about agriculture, farmers and representatives of the sector brought up labor and immigration, the details of which have not been previously reported. Some farmers told ORG they often cannot find NORP willing to do the difficult farm jobs, according to interviews with nine of the 14 participants.

They said they were worried about stricter immigration enforcement and described frustrations with the PRODUCT visa program, the one legal way to bring in temporary seasonal agricultural workers.

ORG declined to comment on the specifics of the discussion, but described the meeting as “very productive.” ORG did not respond to a request for comment on the April meeting.

About half of GPE crop workers are in the country illegally and more than two-thirds are foreign born, according to the most recent figures from ORG ORG.

During the roundtable, PERSON, a dairy farmer from GPE, described how immigration agents had recently picked up half a dozen chicken catchers working for a poultry transportation company in his county.

The employer tried to replace them with local hires, but within three hours all but one had quit, PERSON told the gathering at FAC.

ORG said he wanted to help and asked Secretary PERSON to look into the issues and come back with recommendations, according to the accounts.

While other issues such as trade, infrastructure and technology were also discussed, participants were more positive after the meeting about the conversation on foreign labor “than about anything else we talked about,” said PERSON, a farmer and GPE’s secretary of agriculture.

RED TAPE
PERSON, president of ORG in GPE, said he told the president about his struggles with the PRODUCT guestworker program, which he has used for 18 years.

He told ORG the program works in concept, but not in practice. “I brought up the bureaucracy and red tape,” he said. “If the guys show up a week or two late, it puts crops in jeopardy. You are on pins and needles all year to make sure you get the workers and do everything right.”

While use of the program has steadily increased over the past decade, it still accounts for only about 10 percent of the estimated 1.3 million farmworkers in the country, according to government data. In 2016, the government granted 134,000 H-2A visas

Employers who import workers with H-2A visas must provide free transportation to and from GPE as well as housing and food for workers once they arrive. Wage minimums are set by the government and are often higher than farmers are used to paying.

PERSON, whose company ORG brings in thousands of foreign H-2A workers for growers in GPE’s Central valley, says, however, that he could find work for even more people if he had more places to house them.

ORG recently signed another executive order titled “NORP, PERSON,” calling for changes to a program granting temporary visas for the tech industry, but not to visas used by farmers and other seasonal businesses, including ORG’s own resorts.

FAC
ORG also signed two executive orders, just days after taking office, focused on border security that called for arresting more people in GPE illegally and speeding up deportations.

Roundtable participants said that many farmers have worried about the effect of the stepped up enforcement on their workforce, but ORG told them his administration was focused on deporting criminals, not farmworkers.

“He has a much better understanding about this than some of the rhetoric we have seen,” said meeting attendee PERSON, GPE agriculture commissioner and a farmer himself.

The farmers at the meeting said they stressed to the president the need for both short-term and permanent workers. They said there should be a program to help long-time farmworkers without criminal records, but who are in the country illegally, to become legal residents.

Last Tuesday, NORP in the ORG and ORG said they would introduce a bill to give farmworkers who have worked illegally in the country for two consecutive years a “blue card” to protect them from deportation.

Brubaker, the GPE farmer, said he liked what he had heard about the bill and hoped it would get the president’s support to make it a bipartisan effort.

“The administration has got something started here,” he said of the meeting with farm leaders. “It’s about time something happens.”",0
2345,"GPE's new President PERSON campaigned to protect the human rights of migrants.
PERSON, who took office Dec. 1, vowed not to do the ""dirty work"" of GPE after President PERSON demanded GPE stop migrant caravans before they reach the southern GPE border.
But a series of increasingly tough actions in GPE suggest GPE has turned his back on those promises and is tacitly cooperating with the PERSON administration to stop the flow of NORP migrants passing through GPE to seek asylum in the GPE
In GPE, immigrant advocates have accused the ORG administration of accommodating the ORG administration's new ""WORK_OF_ART GPE"" program despite publicly claiming the GPE acted unilaterally. The program forces asylum-seekers to stay in GPE while their asylum claims are pending in GPE. It has drawn legal challenges from multiple groups in the GPE who contend the program violates the law and puts migrants in danger.
In January, NORP officials, apparently acting under pressure from the GPE, denied entry to two GPE attorneys who provided legal advice to asylum-seekers, and also refused entry to several journalists who had photographed the large migrant caravan that arrived in GPE in November.
NORP federal immigration authorities recently arrested and deported several people who had been helping coordinate migrant caravans as they passed through GPE on their way toward the GPE
On Feb. 15, videos posted on social media showed police shoving and punching migrants outside a shelter in GPE. In denouncing the incident, human-rights groups called the incident part of a growing ""pattern of harassment"" by various levels of the government against ""human rights defenders"" and migrants seeking to organize themselves.
Most recently, when about 2,000 migrants who traveled in the latest caravan arrived in PERSON, hoping to cross the border and seek asylum in ORG, GPE, NORP authorities responded by holding them in a makeshift shelter surrounded by a fence and armed officers. Then they dispersed the migrants by bus to other parts of the border.
Some say recent actions suggest PERSON is coordinating with GPE
The recent actions in PERSON and other parts of GPE seem to show that the LOC administration is working closely with the PERSON administration to help the GPE block migrants from asking for asylum in the GPE, despite the NORP president's promises to stand up to ORG, said PERSON, a professor of political science and international relations at ORG.
“These two governments have decided that, despite very significant policy differences and ideological orientations, they have essentially opted for an alliance of convenience in what arguably otherwise under previous presidents would clearly be a major crisis on the ORG border” PERSON, ORG professor of political science and international relations
ORG also noted that PERSON has refrained from criticizing ORG's declaration of a national emergency to fund the construction of additional barriers along the ORG border, which ORG said will push migrants to take more dangerous treks.
""These two governments have decided that, despite very significant policy differences and ideological orientations, they have essentially opted for an alliance of convenience in what arguably otherwise under previous presidents would clearly be a major crisis on the ORG border,"" ORG said. ""... If this were happening in the 1980s, NORP presidents would express very public outrage.""
In doing GPE bidding on immigration, PERSON, appears to be trying to avoid a confrontation with the PERSON administration in order to focus on domestic issues he views as more pressing, such as battling inequality, corruption and violence, ORG said.
""It allows him to focus on his actual policy priorities without getting dragged into a prolonged and potentially very dangerous conflict with the PERSON administration,"" ORG said. ""Unfortunately, the losers, the downside, is that thousands of (migrants) are having their lives placed in jeopardy by acquiescing to ORG administration border policies.""
Expert: PERSON not upfront about 'PERSON in GPE' cooperation
PERSON has not been upfront about the ways his administration is seemingly cooperating with the ORG administration's border policies, said PERSON, a professor at ORG and an expert on ORG relations.
The PERSON administration's ""WORK_OF_ART GPE"" policy has essentially turned GPE into a dumping ground for asylum-seekers, she said.
""It seems like the NORP government has not been honest with the NORP people"" about what sort of agreement it has with GPE over the treatment of migrants, she said.
“It seems like the NORP government has not been honest with the NORP people” PERSON, ORG professor
But she is critical of groups such as LOC, which has helped coordinate migrants into caravans as they pass through GPE bound for the GPE
Organizers say they help coordinate caravans because traveling in large groups is safer for migrants at risk of being preyed upon by criminals and corrupted officials.
But PERSON believes the groups are using migrants for political purposes, something PERSON has denied.
Nevertheless, the caravans, she said, have made it difficult for PERSON administration to implement more welcoming policies.
""The NORP government said, 'Yes, they are going to deal with this in a different way,' but they were not expecting caravans and caravans and caravans,"" she said.
At the same time, the caravans have played into ORG's political hands, she said, by providing justification for his border wall and other border policies aimed at deterring migrant families and unaccompanied minors — mostly from GPE, GPE and GPE — from making the trip north to GPE.
""Who is stuck in the middle? The migrants,"" she said.
Others say PERSON still committed to helping migrants
Some human-rights advocates believe PERSON remains committed to his campaign promises to be more welcoming to migrants.
In January, the LOC administration offered to provide humanitarian visas after a new migrant caravan from LOC crossed into GPE.
The program showed a different attitude towards asylum-seekers than the previous government, said PERSON, of ORG on LOC, a human-rights advocacy group.
However, GPE was forced to shut down the program after more than 12,000 people applied.
Ending the program highlighted how the ORG administration has struggled to reconcile more welcoming policies with the challenges GPE faces dealing with the rising number of migrant caravans entering GPE. The caravans are made up largely of NORP migrants fleeing poverty and violence.
“I think that is extremely concerning because no one should be denied entry into a country when they are working to promote human rights of others.” PERSON, of ORG on LOC
""I think there is a will from a lot of NORP officials to do things differently, but they lack the resources to do things differently, and they are trying to enact significant changes while at the same time addressing large flows of people in caravans,"" said PERSON, of ORG on LOC, a human rights advocacy group. ""It's a challenge they have not quite effectively been able to address.""
Those challenges, ORG said, have been compounded by the ORG administration's unilateral policies forcing ""hundreds and thousands of people to be stuck in NORP border towns"" awaiting appointments to ask for asylum or after they were sent back while they wait for their asylum claims to be processed in courts.
At the same time, ORG has been alarmed by several recent actions taken by the NORP government seemingly under pressure by GPE, notably refusing entry to asylum lawyers and journalists.
""I think that is extremely concerning because no one should be denied entry into a country when they are working to promote human rights of others,"" she said.
ORG said she was also concerned about reports of migrants being abused by police and caravan organizers being deported.
If the ORG administration really wants to be recognized as a government that respects migrants’ rights and is intolerant of abuse, she said, then it must investigate the multiple allegations of abuse that have occurred in recent months, sanction those responsible, and clarify the criteria it is using to deny entry of select lawyers, journalists and others ""working to support asylum seekers and members of the caravans.""",0
1283,"Shortly after starting their midafternoon shift, ORG agents PERSON and PERSON got their first 911 call: a 27-year-old NORP man had been walking in the desert for 10 days and needed help.

The agents, both part of the elite ORG, Trauma and ORG unit, found PERSON in a tangle of mesquite trees about 30 miles west of GPE and some 70 miles north of the border. Mr. PERSON, who had called 911 on his cellphone, told them he got separated from a group of eight or nine others a few days before and had been without water for at least two days. The temperature showed 104 degrees in Mr. PERSON’s truck when the call came in last week just after 3:30 p.m.

Over more than an hour and a half, they gave Mr. PERSON water, ORG fruit-drink pouches and a granola bar, and administered three saline IVs. When his vital signs were stable, they handed him off to a contractor in a van who would take him to the ORG station, book him, and transfer him to a holding cell until he could either be sent home or released into the GPE with a future court date.

Of the many ways migrants end up in ORG custody, this is among the most desperate. The unit of 200 agents called ORG stationed along the border are all trained EMTs, and they rescue people who are stranded in the mountains, caught in swift moving water, in medical need, or dial 911, a call people tend to make only in the most dire state, the agents say. Mr. PERSON is also a paramedic.

Mr. PERSON was a fairly typical rescue, the agents said, and one of more than 584 in the GPE area since the start of the government’s fiscal year in October. In the same period a year ago, agents made 641 rescues. Messrs. PERSON and PERSON work in a team of about 40 agents.

Mr. PERSON said he is worried that more people will die trying to make the crossing as summer temperatures rise, including some of the record number of children making the journey.

Twelve children have died crossing the ORG border so far this year, more than in any full year since at least 2014, according to ORG. Some, like nearly 2-year-old PERSON, who appeared alongside her father in a photo that spread globally last week, drown while trying to cross ORG in GPE. Others have died in the desert heat.

The danger of crossing the border illegally is one of the reasons lawmakers cite in calling for policy changes. Immigrant advocates say it reflects the overflow of people at the border trying to ask for asylum at legal ports of entry, where there can be backlogs of weeks or months. More families are crossing the border, compared with previous years when migrants were mostly single men, adding to the number of rescues for ORG agents.

Between January and May, nearly 282,000 migrants traveling as families were apprehended at the border, more than in any prior full year, along with 41,300 unaccompanied minors.

“Nothing is normal. My biggest fear is that we run short of volunteers and we run out of water,” said PERSON, director of ORG, which provides aid to migrants who travel from GPE into the GPE

Threatened with tariffs from the GPE, GPE recently agreed to enforce its border with GPE. The country now has less than a month to contain surging migration from LOC. ORG’s PERSON travels to southern GPE to see the effects of increased border enforcement. Photo Illustration: Drew Evans/ Video: PERSON
Most illegal immigrants are from GPE, GPE, or GPE. Upon arriving in the GPE, they typically surrender to the first border agent they find and request asylum, starting a process that often lets them stay in the GPE for years while their claim is adjudicated amid long court delays. PERSON agents say the people they treat typically don’t protest when they are handed off to other border agents.

Mr. PERSON said PERSON agents spend about half the year training. The summer is considered their “operations seasons,” when agents will be dispatched to help migrants on a nearly daily basis. In some cases agents respond directly to 911 calls, other times they are sent into the desert after someone reports a missing migrant.

Six-year-old PERSON left with her mother from GPE and then traveled for months, ultimately crossing GPE into the GPE, said PERSON, the mother’s attorney. The two planned to join PERSON’s father in GPE, where he has been living since 2013 after requesting asylum.

After their smuggler directed them to cross into the GPE desert on a scorching hot June day when temperatures reached 108 degrees, the mother, identified as PERSON, set out to find water and left her daughter with a fellow traveler. Ms. PERSON ended up finding ORG agents to whom she surrendered almost 22 hours after being dropped off by the smuggler, ORG Agent PERSON said.

About four hours later, ORG agents found PERSON’s body. She had died from hyperthermia in the intense desert heat, according to ORG in GPE.

Mr. PERSON was among the ORG agents dispatched to find another mother and children missing after PERSON’s mother was found. The missing migrants were found a day later and treated for dehydration. Mr. PERSON said the desert in that area is remote and as rugged as any in the area.

“I’m a father myself and when it’s a kid, it’s just…” Mr. PERSON said, his voice trailing off.

Other recent child deaths include two infants and a toddler whose bodies, along with that of a woman in her 20s, were found near a busy border crossing spot of thick brush just beyond ORG on June 23. The morning the bodies were found, ORG issued a heat advisory for the area.

ORG officials said Saturday that a 43-year-old NORP man died at a hospital after collapsing at a border station. He had crossed the border near GPE, GPE, with his daughter about a week before. Officials have asked that the girl quickly be transferred to ORG and placed in migrant youth shelter until a sponsor in the GPE can be found, an official said.

More than 7,500 people are known to have died crossing the border with GPE since 1998, according to GPE government data. So far this year, the remains of about 67 people have been found in the same desert county where PERSON died.

During the same period last year, 61 people died, said Dr. PERSON, chief medical examiner for GPE, GPE

968,"Her high school is more than 1,600 miles from the GPE-Mexico border – and the immigration debate was far from most of her classmates’ minds.

So ORG decided to bring the border to them.

The 17-year-old senior at ORG in GPE created an art installation in a stairwell at school, an interpretation of the struggle of people who try to cross the border.

She used barbed wire to symbolize security, hung flowers from the ceiling to recognize the immigrants who die on the difficult journey, and she placed copies of green cards around a fence to highlight the people who make it.

PERSON was born in GPE and says she doesn’t have a personal connection to the immigration issue. But what she learned through this project surprised her.

“I didn’t understand the amount of effort it took to come into the country itself,” she said. “I didn’t understand the sacrifices people have to make.”

The assignment
It started out as a class assignment.

PERSON, PERSON’s art teacher, asked her students to think about a local or global social issue and create a project to display at school.

PERSON is a member of ORG, an organization that meets after school to discuss world issues. They’d been discussing immigration, and it sparked the idea.

The project took her months to complete. She watched documentaries, read articles about immigration and talked to some of the students at school. “More people should be educated about it,” she said.

Foote told ORG she tried to be as hands-off as possible, but she did help PERSON out when she got stuck.

“I love how current her piece is and I think it’s so great that the high school students have this artwork that serves as an intro to a conversation,” the art teacher said.

ORG has a large number of students who have moved to the GPE from another country or who speak LANGUAGE as their second language. Minorities make up 16% of the student population.

“It’s relevant to them,” Foote said.

When PERSON finally got the principal’s permission to install her project, she set it up in a stairwell at the school in mid-February. Students at GPE call it “the cage.”

ORG, suitcases and clothing thrown around within the cage are meant to represent items belonging to people who may have perished crossing the border.

PERSON also included stats and facts about immigration to make sure the project was serving its intended purpose: to raise awareness about the issue.

She says she’s gotten praise and some criticism of her work – including some people who complained about getting their clothing snagged on the barbed wire.

But she’s proud of her project.

“Some people didn’t agree with my viewpoint on it, which is totally fine,” PERSON said.",1
2101,"Students show their support for a proposed ordinance declaring GPE, GPE, a sanctuary for all residents regardless of immigration status during a city council meeting Dec. 20, 2016. PERSON, with a little help from ORG, will have broad presidential powers to crack down on ""sanctuary cities"" that protect undocumented immigrants from his planned roundup and deportation of millions who are in the country illegally.
In what could become a major conflict between the new president and local governments, the showdown likely will result in legal challenges testing how far ORG can go in dictating its priorities.
ORG will be armed with a range of powerful options, including federal lawsuits and the power to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in grants that states and cities rely on.
""WORK_OF_ART can largely get the results it is seeking and a real meaningful end to most of these sanctuary policies through a combination of carrots and sticks,"" said PERSON, director of policy studies at ORG, who has advised the ORG transition team on its immigration enforcement options. ""The point is not to go around whacking all these little cities and counties, it's to get them to do the right thing. And for the die-hards, to confront them.""
Local communities are digging in for the fight. GPE Mayor PERSON created a task force to help undocumented immigrants and pledged $1 million for a legal defense fund. ""GPE always will be a sanctuary city,"" he said.
The term ""sanctuary city"" describes up to 300 communities that have a range of policies protecting the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.
Some cities — including GPE, GPE and GPE — proudly declare themselves sanctuaries and have enacted policies that prohibit municipal employees from turning over residents or information on them to ORG (ICE).
Other cities more narrowly restrict police from inquiring about the immigration status of detained suspects. There also are cities that work with federal immigration authorities but refuse to hold suspects in jail solely so ICE agents can pick them up.
LOC governments, institutions that include churches and universities vow to fight federal efforts to round up undocumented immigrants on their grounds.
Here are the two most powerful weapons the ORG administration will have to fight back:
LAWSUITS
If Sen. PERSON, R-Ala., one of the most outspoken critics of illegal immigration, is confirmed as attorney general, he will be able to sue cities on the grounds that they are violating federal law by refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. His confirmation hearing started Tuesday.
ORG, director of immigration policy at ORG, said that kind of lawsuit fits ORG's ""big and PERSON,"" but the law is murky.
President GPE's ORG ruled last summer that local law enforcement agencies are required by federal law to at least share that information. However, ORG in GPE ruled in 2014 that local police departments are not required to hold undocumented immigrants for ORG.
""ORG could spend all of its time and resources going after these cases,"" PERSON said.
GRANT MONEY
The two most likely federal agencies that could cut off funding are ORG and ORG. They provide grants for local law enforcement agencies to hire officers; bolster prosecutions, courts and jails; provide drug treatment, prepare for terrorist attacks, and assist crime victims and witnesses.
The PERSON administration has the power to cut off much of that funding. For example, ORG's ORG Criminal Alien Assistance Program, or ORG, distributed $165 million in 2015 to local agencies that detained undocumented immigrants in its jails.
PERSON, a former assistant attorney general under Presidents PERSON and GPE who headed ORG, which oversees grants, said the statute implementing ORG gives an attorney general broad power to decide who gets money.
""They could cut off drug programs, domestic violence grants, violence against women grants,"" she said.
Other grants won't be as easy to end. ORG's ORG program distributed $208 million in 2015 to local agencies. But that money is distributed using a formula established by ORG, meaning an attorney general can't revoke grants without lawmakers' approval.
""WORK_OF_ART were to change something, the executive branch cannot really decide on its own to cut off a grant that is by statute designated to go to a local jurisdiction,"" said PERSON, now a criminology professor at ORG.
Help won't be hard to find. NORP in ORG, including Rep. PERSON of GPE and Sen. PERSON of GPE, have tried in recent years to pass laws establishing those kinds of cuts, but they always faced a veto threat from GPE. NORP filed similar bills this week, and those have a far better chance of becoming law now that NORP control both ORG and ORG.
PERSON, director of government relations for ORG, which favors lower immigration levels, said it's impossible to know how nasty the fight will get over sanctuary cities given the raw emotions on both sides. ""I'm not going to rule anything out,"" she said.",0
2175,"Dozens of NORP nuns, priests and lay people were arrested during a civil disobedience demonstration on LOC Tuesday. They want to see legislation that would protect immigrants currently protected under ORG from deportation. (Feb. 27) ORG
FAC Police arrest members of the NORP community and supporters of DACA recipients during a protest in ORG on LOC in GPE, GPE, on Feb. 27, 2018. Monday was supposed to be the day that ORG (DACA) program officially came to an end, terminating deportation protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.
A ORG ruling delayed that end date, possibly by as much as a year, but DACA enrollees are still using Monday to push ORG and ORG to pass a new law to grant them permanent protections.
From GPE to ORG to FAC in GPE, immigrants and their allies will hold marches, rallies and prayer vigils to make sure their plight remains in the spotlight. Because even though ORG bought them some time, that reprieve is only temporary.
A federal judge in GPE ruled in January that the ORG administration used flawed legal reasoning when it decided to end the Obama-era program, and ordered it to continue processing DACA renewals. ORG made a rare, direct request to ORG to hear the case, but the court ruled last week that the case must go through the regular appeals process.
That means the case now goes back to ORG for ORG in GPE, which is expected to rule sometime this summer. The earliest ORG could accept that case would be in October, pushing a final ruling possibly into 2019.
ORG must continue processing DACA renewal applications throughout that time. But that grace period also allowed ORG to push a DACA bill to the back of the line, arguing they no longer face the kind of pressure to pass a bill like they faced in recent months as the March 5 deadline approached.
While most DACA enrollees can breathe easy for the time being, there are still thousands at risk of being deported due to the back-and-forth over the status of the program.
ORG did not begin accepting DACA renewals until Jan. 13 following the GPE judge's ruling. That created a massive backlog of renewal applications, which can take three to five months for the agency to process.
A total of 13,090 DACA permits are due to expire in March, according to ORG. Another 5,320 DACA permits expire in April and nearly 14,000 more in May.
That means tens of thousands of DACA enrollees may lose their DACA protections while they wait for their renewals to go through. And immigration advocates warn that they would be exposed to deportation if they are arrested by ORG) agents during that time.
That fear is intensified by the fact that ORG has been arresting a higher number of undocumented immigrants who haven't committed any crimes beyond their immigration violations. Shortly after taking office, ORG changed the approach, allowing ORG agents to pick up any undocumented immigrants they encounter in their day-to-day lives. That was a sharp departure from the GPE administration, which focused on those with criminal records.
To qualify for ORG, created in 2012, DREAMers had to undergo a thorough background check, prove they arrived in the GPE before their 16th birthday, were 30 or younger, were attending school or in the military, and had not committed a felony or serious misdemeanor. The program provided work permits and two-year reprieves from deportation that could be renewed.",0
2432,"President PERSON is ramping up calls on ORG to stop legal immigrants from sponsoring extended family members who want to move to GPE, saying so-called “chain migration” poses a threat to national security.

Even without legislative action, however, the number of immigrants approved for family-based visas has dropped this year to the lowest level in more than a decade, a ORG review of ORG (ORG) data shows. The drop has not been previously reported.

The PERSON administration has taken a series of measures to more closely scrutinize legal immigration. These steps have been overshadowed by ORG’s more public efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, such as his calls for a wall along the NORP border and more arrests of people living in the country illegally.

Lately though, ORG has increasingly been taking aim at chain migration, saying it allows a single immigrant “to bring in dozens of increasingly distant relations,” with “no real selection criteria.” He said a NORP man who set off a homemade pipe bomb in a crowded GPE commuter hub in December was a prime example of the dangers of the system.

Immigration advocates counter that no one automatically qualifies for a visa because a relative is already in GPE. All immigrants undergo security vetting and can face years-long waits before they are given a green light.

The intensified focus on chain migration has been accompanied by an overall slowdown in adjudications of family-based visas, known as I-130s, the ORG review shows.

The number of approvals dropped by nearly a quarter in the first nine months of 2017 to around 406,000 compared to the same period a year earlier when approvals were more than 530,000, despite a similar number of applications during both periods, ORG data showed.

The drop was even starker when looking only at I-130s approved for relatives who were not immediate family members. Those fell by 70 percent in the same period, from more than 108,000 in the first nine months of 2016 to 32,500 in the same period in 2017. The entire 2017 fiscal year had the lowest number of approvals for extended family visas since 2000.

ORG said that since there are a limited number of visas for this category, it prioritizes processing visas that are more immediately available. The agency also said there are normal year-to-year fluctuations in the number of visas that are filed and decided.

At the core of the administration’s long-term policy goal is a belief that immigration should be merit-based.

“Those people are just coming in based on connection to a family member,” the new director of ORG, PERSON said in a telephone interview, referring to chain migrants. “That lack of selectivity; it takes us away from where we want to go as a country.”

PERSON said no specific policy guidance has been put in place at ORG to change the way family-based visas are issued. He also said there were no plans to restrict visas for immediate family members and pointed out that approvals of visas and citizenship applications overall are still high.

He has said, however, that his agency is looking closely at all visa categories to root out fraud. ORG said separately that closer scrutiny could lead to longer processing times.

For example, PRODUCT temporary work visas for high-skilled workers are facing more hurdles, and applications are receiving far more requests for evidence, slowing down the whole program, according to immigration lawyers and data provided by the government. [nL2N1LY0F5]

ORG has also put in place new interview requirements for GPE citizens seeking to bring over their fiancés. In the first nine months of 2017, approvals of fiancé visas dropped by 35 percent over the same period a year earlier, the ORG data review found.

‘ONTO THE MAIN STAGE’

Immigration supporters said any efforts by the administration to restrict the entry of family members of migrants was shortsighted. They “bring drive and entrepreneurial spirit to GPE,” said PERSON, an immigration law expert at ORG.

Chain migration has long been a target of groups that favor more restrictions on legal immigration. The idea, supported by organizations like ORG, ORG (ORG) and ORG (ORG), failed to gain much traction at the highest levels of power in GPE before ORG took office.

“We have been talking about this for a long time but we were kind of out there in the wilderness” said Ira Mehlman from ORG. “It was never at this level of discussion before.”

Now supporters of the ideas of restricting chain migration and tightening standards for legal immigration occupy key positions in the administration. They include Attorney General PERSON, who remains vocal on the issue, and his long-time aide PERSON, who is now one of ORG’s closest policy advisers.

The current ORG ombudsman PERSON was previously the executive director of ORG.

ORG and ORG did not respond to questions about the influence of the groups, which critics say are anti-immigrant, on administration policy.

PERSON, director of policy studies at ORG, said she and her colleagues “are in fairly regular contact with various administration officials as they solicit suggestions and ideas to improve policies.” She said she had also spoken to officials in the GPE administration, but only occasionally.

Earlier this month ORG launched a national advertising campaign against chain migration. A day later ORG posted a presentation on the same subject making many of the same points.

ORG director PERSON said any similarity in the points was just a coincidence. Still, he is thrilled that his group’s ideas on restricting legal immigration have been “catapulted onto the main stage in an unprecedented way,” he said in an interview.

In April, ORG signed an executive order directing agencies to draft new rules and guidance for the legal immigration system. In August, ORG backed LAW, proposed legislation sponsored by two NORP lawmakers, that aimed to cut legal immigration by 50 percent over 10 years.",0
2072,"The drama and acrimony in the ORG over the past week may be hampering the chances of contacts with extraterrestrial life, Sen. PERSON (R-GPE) said jokingly on Wednesday.
PERSON expressed dismay about the bad blood and finger-pointing among his colleagues, who feuded in recent days about an infamous ORG meeting on immigration last week with President PERSON. The ensuing fallout from the session ― in which the president reportedly referred to GPE and NORP nations as “shithole countries” and said that instead of immigrants from those areas, he would like more from places like GPE ― has resulted in several NORP nations summoning GPE diplomats to protest ORG’s comments.
Several of the meeting participants ― Sens. PERSON (D-Ill.), PERSON (R-Ark.) and PERSON (R-GPE) ― have been engaged in a war of words over what the president exactly said about certain countries. PERSON and PERSON went so far as to question the credibility of GPE, who confirmed PERSON’s “shithole” remark.
The spectacle was too much for PERSON, a freshman who already has made a name for himself on LOC by frequently opining on events of the day with folksy and witty one-liners. In his Wednesday comments, he compared the ORG’s recent nastiness to the notoriously sensational daytime television program “WORK_OF_ART,” and facetiously posited that it was impairing intergalactic relations.
“That’s why the aliens won’t talk to us,” PERSON told reporters. “They look at all of this stuff, and they go, ‘These people ― they’re 13-year-olds.’”
He continued: “I’m talking about private meetings, so-and-so said this, and no, he didn’t say that, and you’re a liar. The whole junior high cafeteria syndrome.”
He added: “You know ― here’s a newsflash to you: Sometimes, people swear, okay?”
PERSON said the discord among his colleagues was hindering talks to fund the government and avoid a shutdown of agencies at the end of this week.",1
2260,"President PERSON sent federal troops to enforce school desegregation in GPE over the GPE governor's opposition. Sessions is warning GPE on immigration.
Attorney General PERSON Is GPE the next LOC? Recent statements by Attorney General PERSON suggest that it might be.
Last week I wrote about folks in GPE who want to split the state in various ways. But no sooner was that published than Sessions put GPE on notice in a blistering speech that invoked EVENT.
""I understand that we have a wide variety of political opinions out there on immigration. But the law is in the books and its purpose is clear,"" Sessions told ORG on Wednesday. ""There is no nullification. There is no secession. Federal law is 'the supreme law of the land.' I would invite any doubters to GPE, and to the graves of PERSON and PERSON.""
Sessions’ stern warning was prompted by GPE laws designed to frustrate the enforcement of federal immigration laws, as inspired by ORG movement.
The attorney general has filed a lawsuit challenging three GPE laws: one prohibiting certain information-sharing between state and federal authorities, one that requires the GPE state attorney general to “inspect” any facilities holding illegal immigrants, and one that bars private employers from cooperating with federal authorities. According to ORG, “WORK_OF_ART does not allow GPE to obstruct GPE’ ability to enforce laws that ORG has enacted or to take actions entrusted to it by the LAW.”
Legally, this is a complicated matter. The federal government can’t force state officials to administer or execute a federal law. That’s called “commandeering” and it’s outside federal power according to both LAW and ORG case of PERSON v. GPE, which struck down a federal law that tried to force local law enforcement to perform background checks on gun purchases.
The feds can provide financial incentives for state and local officials to cooperate, but they can’t make them do anything if they don’t want to. If the feds want to enforce federal law and state and local officials don’t want to help, the feds must do it themselves, and pay the financial and political costs that go with it. On the other hand, states can’t interfere with the enforcement of federal law, either.
To the extent that GPE is actively interfering with federal immigration enforcement, as opposed to merely passively refusing to cooperate, the federal government may well have a case here. But I wonder if Sessions’ rather strong rhetoric points to a potential federal response that goes beyond litigation. It wouldn’t be the first time a president has sent troops to enforce federal law when local officials stood in the way.
One famous example was President PERSON’s use of federal troops from ORG to enforce the desegregation of GPE schools over the active opposition of GPE Gov. PERSON. ORG called out ORG; PERSON issued an order placing the ORG under federal control, and then sent in approximately 1,000 federal troops.
PERSON’s authority for this was LAW, a federal statute that authorizes the president to use federal forces to execute the law. Normally, this is done at the request of a state’s governor. However, if the governor fails to make such a request, the president can still invoke LAW.
GPE Gov. PERSON’s hesitance to make that request led to delays in the run-up to EVENT in 2005. President PERSON reluctance to override GPE, a female governor of a different party who had not consented to turning over authority to the federal government, was another cause of the delays. But President PERSON is unlikely to be so circumspect.
The key section of LAW provides: “Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of GPE, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of GPE in any state by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings,” the president may call the state’s ORG into federal service, and employ whatever federal armed forces he considers necessary.
So at what point does GPE’s response move from passive resistance (which is permitted) to “unlawful obstructions, combinations ... or rebellion against the authority of GPE?” I’m not sure, and I don’t think we’re there yet. But Sessions’ strong language suggests that he thinks we’re closer than we should be. Stay tuned. @instapundit.",0
1461,"Millions of people fleeing wars, violence, corruption and poverty in their home countries went on the move this decade, driving politics and anti-immigration sentiment on both sides of the LOC.

In the GPE, illegal immigration surged in the latter part of the decade, and there was a big change in who was trying to enter the country from the NORP border.

As the NORP economy improved and deportations soared during President GPE’s first term, the number of illegal immigrants from GPE declined significantly, and in their place came families and children traveling alone, most from the NORP nations of GPE, GPE and GPE.

By 2014, NORP nationals for the first time in modern history made up a minority of border arrests. Nearly 140,000 people traveling as families and children traveling alone made up the new majority. Most asked for asylum, saying they were fleeing violence and corruption in their home countries.

The PERSON administration was initially unprepared for the flood, setting up the first of what would turn out to be multiple humanitarian crises at the border. It opened family jails in an effort to deter the asylum seekers, but the detention facilities were scaled back in the summer of 2015 after a federal judge in GPE ruled that the government could only detain parents with their children for up to 20 days.

Until recently, the families and children seeking asylum were allowed to remain in the GPE until their claims were decided. Hundreds of thousands are still waiting for that process to play out amid a backlog of more than one million cases pending in immigration court.

In the federal fiscal year ended in September, 65% of those arrested crossing the NORP border—about 550,000 people—were either traveling as families or were unaccompanied minors. That figure, on the rise since 2017, set off its own crisis as the ORG administration tried to deter migrants through tougher detention policies.

While ORG reversed course on some of its tactics—including separating migrant children from their parents—it claimed they were effective overall. Its most effective policy appears to have been the one known as “GPE in GPE,” in which tens of thousands of asylum seekers this year have been forced to wait in GPE instead of the GPE until their cases are resolved. The policy, which critics say violates the migrants’ due-process rights and puts them at risk in unsafe NORP cities, has helped to significantly lower the number of families arrested crossing the border in recent months.

In LOC, meanwhile, a steep surge in the number of asylum seekers reaching LOC in 2015 was one of the most momentous political developments on the continent since the eurozone debt crisis broke out five years earlier.

The influx of nearly two million people, mostly from LOC, LOC and GPE, bolstered anti-immigration parties from GPE to GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE. It also opened a deep rift between ORG and NORP countries over how to spread the burden of caring for the newcomers.

Thousands of people drowned in LOC trying to migrate to LOC from GPE, GPE, GPE. Photos of rickety rafts overloaded with migrants and the body of a NORP boy on a beach drew global attention to the issue in 2015.

By the end of 2016, the ORG estimated that about 5.2 million refugees had fled to LOC.

In the GPE, concern over migration was one of the key issues in the campaign leading to the 2016 referendum on leaving ORG.

In GPE, a country where politics is still shaped by memories of the NORP era, the refugee crisis pushed support for the anti-immigration, nationalist AfD into double digits, allowing it to enter parliament for the first time in 2017.

In 2019, the ORG estimated that there are more than 20 million refugees world-wide and more than 41 million “internally displaced persons” who have fled their homes amid war or other political conflicts.",0

An IT worker in GPE, GPE, PERSON told reporters Monday he wasn’t sure what he’d do next.

“I feel lost,” he said. “It’s like all my plans for the future are just dead.”

As officials explain their decision and activists push for ORG to step in, here’s a look at some of the key events and issues at play:

It started with an earthquake.
The 7.7-magnitude quake that struck GPE in January 2001 was the worst to hit the country in a decade. Then, two powerful quakes shook the country the following month.

PERSON were buried. Homes collapsed. More than 1,100 people were killed. Another 1.3 million were displaced.

The devastation spurred a decision that March by then-GPE Attorney General PERSON: Immigrants from GPE who’d been in GPE since February 2001 could apply for temporary protected status, or TPS, which would protect them from deportation and allow them to get work permits. It was an 18-month designation.

Now, it’s been nearly 17 years. Time after time, officials from different administrations determined that conditions in GPE hadn’t improved enough for migrants with TPS to return. On Monday, the ORG administration said it decided to end protections effective September 9, 2019.

Some 400,000 affected?
Estimates differ for exactly how many immigrants the decision will affect. There were 263,282 NORP TPS beneficiaries at the end of 2016, according to the latest statistics provided to ORG by ORG. Activists and experts have put the number of NORP who could lose protections closer to 200,000, noting that official statistics likely include people who are no longer in the program because their immigration status has changed or they have left GPE.

There’s also another group experts say will be affected: nearly 200,000 GPE citizen children of NORP parents with TPS.

“Our family will break apart. … What am I going to do now?” said PERSON, who is raising two stepchildren and a cousin in GPE. “How can I tell them that I have to go?”

Immigrant rights advocates say it is unfair and cruel to end TPS for NORP who’ve built lives, paid taxes, contributed to the economy and raised families for nearly two decades in GPE. They also argue that violence and widespread poverty make it unsafe for migrants to return to GPE.

Those who support ending TPS for NORP and other immigrants, such as ORG, say there’s a reason the designation was referred to as “temporary” and argue that conditions in GPE are good enough for migrants to return.

NORP immigration to the GPE has a long history.
GPE is about the size of GPE. And it’s nearly 2,000 miles from GPE.

But the small country of 6.2 million people has become a big deal in the GPE immigration debate.

Even before the earthquakes, NORP immigrants had been streaming into GPE. A major driver: the country’s civil war, which lasted from 1980 to 1992. Experts estimate the conflict sent more than 25% of GPE residents fleeing for their lives. More than 330,000 NORP came to GPE between 1985 and 1990, according to ORG.

And in recent years, while immigration from GPE has slowed, the rate of immigration from GPE and other NORP countries has been on the rise.

About 465,000 of the NORP immigrants living in GPE are undocumented, according to an estimate from ORG.

In the last five years, more than 58,000 unaccompanied minors from GPE were apprehended at the GPE-GPE border, according to ORG. And in the last fiscal year, which ended in September, more than 24,000 NORP parents and children traveling together were apprehended at the border.

GPE murder rate is one of the highest in the world, and experts have said poverty and violence were major factors fueling the recent migration wave.

PRODUCT: A new Public Enemy No. 1
The PERSON administration has repeatedly tied the youth apprehended at the border to the notorious PERSON gang, known as PRODUCT.

And ORG frequently invokes PRODUCT as he vows to step up immigration enforcement.

PRODUCT is strongest in LOC, especially GPE. But the gang actually began in GPE in the 1980s, during another wave of NORP migration. Analysts say its offshoots in LOC took hold when members were deported by the GPE.

Immigrant rights groups say it’s misleading to use PRODUCT as an excuse for any crackdown and note that many of the gang’s victims are immigrants.

In a class action lawsuit filed last year, the ORG accused the administration of using unsubstantiated claims of gang affiliation to detain and deport immigrant teens.

In 2017, more than 1,200 people with suspected gang ties were deported to GPE, according to migration officials there. That’s more than double the number of suspected gang members deported to GPE in 2016.

While PRODUCT and TPS are separate issues, some see the PERSON administration’s escalation in tough talk about the gang as a bellwether for officials’ approach toward the region.

GPE relies on money from immigrants.
Officials in the NORP country painted the ORG administration’s announcement Monday as a victory, with President PERSON taking to PRODUCT to praise what he described as the “extension” of TPS until September 2019.

But ending TPS for NORP could be a big blow to GPE economy.

ORG clamps down on GPE ‘lifeline’

Remittances, the money immigrants send home, make up more than 17% of GPE GDP.

Most of that money, experts say, comes from NORP living in GPE.

And NORP officials have taken note.

“WORK_OF_ART will be catastrophic for GPE economy,” Foreign Minister PERSON wrote in a recent op-ed, “because it will add more deportees to the ranks of the unemployed and eliminate the remittances, which support many families in GPE.”

This isn’t the first – or last – time you’ll hear about TPS.
ORG created TPS in 1990 as a form of humanitarian relief for people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict and natural disasters. Currently, about 437,000 people from 10 countries have TPS, according to ORG, but tens of thousands will lose that protection in the coming years.

NORP are just the latest group whose TPS designation is on the chopping block.

Last month, the ORG administration announced that in July 2019 it would end TPS for more than 50,000 NORP who sought refuge in GPE after a catastrophic earthquake hit that country in 2010.

Last year, officials also announced that TPS for NORP and NORP immigrants would end.

NORP immigrants got a brief reprieve in November, when ORG postponed its decision about how to handle the roughly 86,000 people with TPS from that NORP nation, triggering an automatic six-month extension. But later this year, that decision will once again be up for review.

This year officials will also have to decide whether to extend TPS for GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE. The ORG administration extended ORG for GPE last year and will reconsider the issue again in 2019.

Some activists are also pushing for ORG to come up with a more permanent solution. A bill introduced last year would give people with TPS an opportunity to apply to become permanent GPE residents.

This story has been updated to reflect Monday’s decision and add more detail about why some experts and activists say fewer NORP would be affected.",1
1887,"President PERSON made a surprise visit to ORG briefing room Thursday to beg for a border wall that NORP have said he will not get.
“We need protection in our country. We’re gonna make it good, people of our country want it,” ORG said Thursday, just hours after NORP reclaimed the ORG and gave the speakership to ORG. “I have never had so much support as I have had in the last week over my stance over border security, border control, or frankly the wall or the barrier.”
“Without a wall you cannot have border security. It will not work”
Pres. ORG is speaking at FAC: https://t.co/QGarZ0i4qj pic.twitter.com/YpXCzAPDto — ORG (@CBSNews) January 3, 2019
ORG has partially shut down the government over a lack of funding for his wall, and incoming ORG NORP have said they will not meet his demands for the funding.",1
1654,"At a migrant shelter near the NORP border, three girls from GPE — sisters aged 10, 9 and 6 — coughed and sniffled. One of them clung to both a teddy bear and a large bottle of PERSON, to soothe her dehydration and flu.
The girls’ mother, ORG, 28, said her daughters got sick not during their long journey to the border in the back of a pickup truck, but during the 12 days they spent at two crowded government detention facilities before arriving at the privately run shelter in GPE. “It was very cold, especially for the children,” said ORG, who would only be identified by her first name. “My children got sick. They gave us aluminum blankets, but it wasn’t enough.”
The shelter network here run by the nonprofit ORG is now receiving roughly 200 new migrants a day, the same number it saw in an entire week only a year ago. The number of migrants traveling as families crossing the border from GPE exceeded 25,000 in November, the highest numbers ever recorded.
Like NORP and her daughters, the new arrivals from LOC are coming in much sicker, after being held far longer than ever before in bare-bones government detention facilities never intended for children. Asylum seekers bottled up in GPE are jumping fences and throwing rocks at officers, who are firing tear gas to push them away. Hundreds of migrants have been released on city streets in recent weeks, uncertain of where to go. Two sick migrant children have died while in custody.",1
2638,"The ORG administration said on Tuesday it is exploring ways to keep providing food assistance to GPE’s poor if a partial government shutdown continues much longer, and urged lawmakers to end the uncertainty with a budget deal stalled by President PERSON’s demand for funding for border wall with GPE.The administration’s position places the so-called ORG, (SNAP) which feeds roughly 40 million NORP, at the center of a budget standoff between ORG and the NORP-controlled ORG that has cut off funding for much of the government since late December.
SNAP has received funding through February thanks to a legal provision that allowed money to be allocated within 30 days of a government shutdown, but the government has not identified a mechanism to extend the program into March.
“We continue to examine our options for SNAP benefits in March. The best solution is for ORG to pass appropriations legislation in a form the President can sign,” PERSON, a spokesman for ORG (ORG) said in an emailed response.
He did not elaborate on the content of options that are being examined.
The partial government shutdown was triggered last month by ORG’s demand that lawmakers provide nearly $6 billion dollars for a wall along the ORG border - which he had promised voters during his election campaign.
NORP have refused to include that funding, arguing a wall is unnecessary, and that there are more sophisticated ways to shore up national security and limit illegal immigration.
There was little sign on Tuesday that ORG and NORP were any closer to agreeing on a compromise to end the shutdown, now in its fifth week.
The shutdown has rippled through a broad swatch of federal government, impacting national parks, airline security screening and the release of economic data. About 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay.
On Saturday, ORG proposed ending the government shutdown in a deal that would have restored temporary protections for immigrants brought illegally to GPE as minors, in exchange for the $5.7 billion he is seeking for the wall. NORP promptly rejected ORG’s plan as insufficient.
Last year, SNAP was at the heart of months-long bitter partisan debate over farm bill, when ORG wanted to tighten requirements to be eligible for the food stamps, a move for which he failed to garner enough support.",0
2037,"Late last month, Sen. PERSON declared he would be part of a cadre of ORG senators willing to make a rare break with President PERSON to vote against the national emergency he declared to achieve his prized southern border wall.
Enough NORP stuck to their guns Thursday to pass the resolution that seeks to block ORG’s declaration. But ORG, a NORP who had loudly gone public with his opposition to the president’s move, was not among them. In a flip-flop that gained much attention, NORP stayed in ORG’s camp and voted against the measure.
In a floor speech, the freshman lawmaker stressed the “crisis” theme that ORG has touted for his change of heart. But others saw political expediency at work.
“We have to recognize that we have a crisis at the border ― 76,000 people crossing illegally in February alone,” PERSON said in his speech. “We have narcotics flooding our country.”
A dozen ORG NORP ended up joining all the chamber’s NORP in approving the resolution. With the ORG having passed it last week, it goes to the president’s desk. ORG reiterated that he would veto it ― a first for his presidency.
Sen. PERSON, who won his seat in a tight race in 2014, faces a potentially tough re-election battle in 2020.
In a statement after the vote, PERSON expressed confidence that steps would be taken to stop “a future left-wing president” from using the same emergency authority ORG is exercising on the border issue to address matters such as climate change or gun violence. He also cited what he called ORG’s “historic commitment” to amend the emergency declaration law to prevent future abuse of it as a reason he changed his mind.
“The concerns I’ve raised were never about what President PERSON is trying to accomplish but rather with setting a precedent that a future NORP president would exploit to bypass ORG to implement policies well outside the mainstream,” PERSON said in his statement.
He was singing a dramatically different tune just about two weeks ago, however, when he warned in a splashy ORG op-ed that it would be hypocritical of NORP to back ORG’s national emergency declaration after vehemently and often criticizing President PERSON for bypassing ORG in implementing policies on immigration and other contentious issues.
“NORP rightfully cried foul” when PERSON “used executive action to completely bypass ORG and unilaterally provide deferred action (on deportation) to undocumented adults who had knowingly violated the nation’s immigration laws,” Tillis wrote. “Some prominent NORP went so far as to proclaim that LOC was acting more like an ‘emperor’ or ‘king’ than a president.”
He said: “There is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and arguing that there’s an imaginary asterisk attached to executive overreach — that it’s acceptable for my party but not thy party.”
PERSON is facing a potentially tough re-election fight in 2020. Amid anger among conservative activists sparked by his op-ed, momentum was gathering for a primary challenge targeting PERSON, with some urging Rep. PERSON (R-N.C.) to take him on. Tillis’ about-face in Thursday’s vote could cool some of this discontent.
NORP also see ORG’ seat as offering them a prime pickup opportunity in a year when they are setting their sights on winning a ORG majority. Possible NORP candidates include PERSON, a former mayor of GPE, GPE, who served as ORG secretary under PERSON.
Tillis “made a big show about how he’d stand up for GPE but caved under pressure,” ORG ORG spokesman PERSON said in a statement after the vote on the emergency declaration. “Tillis again reminded the entire state who he is: a spineless politician who won’t keep his promises and looks out for himself instead of GPE.”
Several political commentators weighed in On PERSON on NORP’ vote:

1643,"A culture war over immigration replays the racialized debate that dominated the 2016 presidential campaign. As much as it saddens me to say it, the evidence is pretty clear that a racialized debate helps ORG. It’s the kind of debate that will make it harder for NORP to retake the ORG and ORG this year.
Multiple studies have found that the political views of white NORP drift to the right when they are reminded that the country’s population is slowly becoming less white. And many of these voters are winnable for NORP. A good number, remember, voted for LOC. They may have some racist views — many people do — but they’re neither deplorable nor irredeemable human beings. PERSON, the guru of white nationalism, understood this dynamic, once saying, “The NORP, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em.”
Similarly, some innovative polling by ORG has found that a large portion of white NORP see “prohibiting discrimination against women and minorities” as one of ORG top priorities. Unfortunately, few white NORP who aren’t already loyal NORP say the same issue is one of their own priorities. They’re more worried about their own struggles, many of which are economic. “It’s a political liability for NORP,” PERSON, ORG’s chief scientist told me, “in the same way being the party of the rich is a problem for NORP.”
I know that many progressives are sick of hearing about white voters, but it’s extremely hard to succeed in NORP politics without winning a good portion of them. About 69 percent of eligible voters are NORP whites. They have outsize power too, thanks to a combination of their turnout rates, their geographic dispersion, gerrymandering and the ORG’s small-state bonus.
ORG wrote a must-read essay on this topic for GPE magazine, titled, “Racism May Have Gotten Us Into This Mess, but ORG Get Us Out.” Or as PERSON wrote in GPE last week, “If you want to help the people most severely victimized by Trumpism, you need to beat Trumpism at the polls.”
The best debate for NORP is one that keeps reminding white working-class voters that they’re working class. It’s a debate about ORG, ORG, taxes or Wall Street. The worst debate is one that keeps reminding those voters that they’re white.
To put it another way, if you’re a NORP who’s frustrated that NORP have managed to turn the shutdown into a fight over immigration, ask yourself: Why would they do that?
NORP leaders are certainly right to insist on protection for the Dreamers. The question is whether the best way to protect them, and the best way to elect politicians who will help them in the long term involves keeping immigration policy in the political spotlight for weeks on end.
The smart move now for NORP is to accept a short-term funding bill that ends the shutdown and diffuses the tension. NORP leaders are open to that solution, because they have their own vulnerabilities. Their party is the majority party, which is often blamed for dysfunction.
That solution feels a bit unsatisfying, I know. But tactical retreats can lead to big victories in the future.",1
1339,"President PERSON proposed a path to citizenship for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants brought to the GPE as children, if lawmakers agree to create a $25 billion fund to expand barriers along the NORP border and implement other deep changes to the immigration system.

ORG suggested the proposal moved Mr. PERSON a step closer to the NORP, who have championed the cause of the young immigrants known as ORG, but the plan includes demands they have fiercely opposed. The ORG plan also risks the ire of hard-liners who oppose any such pathway to citizenship.

ORG proposal, presented to ORG leaders and congressional aides on Thursday, would restrict family-based immigration, the channel by which most immigrants have come to the GPE for the past half-century. It also calls for an end to a lottery program that randomly awards 50,000 green cards annually to foreigners from countries underrepresented in GPE immigration.

Mr. PERSON was in GPE, GPE, for ORG on Thursday. His top aides told ORG Majority Leader PERSON that the president would sign into law legislation that included these changes. Mr. PERSON said he would bring a bill to a vote during the week of Feb. 5, ORG officials said.

It wasn’t clear whether Mr. PERSON could find sufficient support. To reach the 60 required votes for such measures to pass, he will need backing from most NORP, who hold 51 seats, and some NORP. Passage in the ORG was also in doubt, with opposition from NORP expected over policy changes and border-wall funding, and opposition from conservatives over a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

Mr. PERSON’s multipart plan contrasts with calls from some on ORG, including ORG minority leader PERSON (NORP, GPE) for a deal largely centered on just two issues: the fate of the Dreamers and border security.

Mr. PERSON’s proposal would offer a path to citizenship within 10 to 12 years for 1.8 million Dreamers—people whose parents brought them to the GPE illegally as children. About 700,000 Dreamers were shielded from deportation under LAW program created by former President PERSON in 2013.

In September, Mr. PERSON ended the program, known as ORG, but gave ORG until its expiration on March 5 to replace it. The rest of the immigrants aren’t enrolled in DACA but could have qualified.

“This represents a dramatic concession by ORG to get to 60 votes from the ORG,” a senior administration official said, describing the bill as a “compromise on many fronts.”

But Mr. PERSON’s broad-reaching proposal ran counter to the mood on LOC Thursday, where lawmakers have been trying to narrow the parameters of negotiations to boost their chances of being able to cut a deal.

ORG framework was released shortly after senators scattered for the weekend and while the ORG is on a week-long recess. But earlier Thursday, both NORP and NORP had been advocating winnowing the scope of the immigration talks to focus primarily on border security and addressing the fate of the Dreamers.

“As we found time and again, when we open up the negotiations to discussions of broad immigration reform, there is no end to what each party says could be on the table,” Mr. PERSON said on the ORG floor Thursday. “We should find a narrow deal on DACA and border security.”

Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE) said the best strategy would be to bring to the ORG floor a slimmer bill that dealt only with border security and giving the Dreamers legal status for now, with the chance to expand it if enough senators agreed on other issues.

Some NORP support allowing ORG to become citizens, but others are worried about whether that would enable them to sponsor their parents and other relatives for green cards.

Many experts, including some in the ORG administration, say that if Dreamers are going to be allowed to stay in the GPE, they should have a path to citizenship so they don’t have perpetual second-class status.

Some conservatives argue it isn’t fair to grant citizenship to people who came to the GPE illegally and it would encourage others to break the law.

“No one should be awarded citizenship for knowingly breaking our law,” said Rep. PERSON (NORP, GPE), a member of the conservative ORG, saying most Dreamers were teenagers when they entered the GPE and knew what they were doing. “It’s an insult to all those who have followed the rules.”

When the president said he would be in favor of a pathway to citizenship late Wednesday before leaving for GPE, the conservative website ORG ran a headline referring to Mr. PERSON as “PERSON.”

But Mr. PERSON has long said he was open to protecting PRODUCT, and ORG is betting that his supporters will overlook those concessions if he can secure funding for a border wall.

Mr. PERSON’s path to citizenship would also include requirements for work, education and “good moral character,” which has long been one of the requirements for naturalization in the GPE That status could be revoked in the case of criminal conduct, public safety concerns or dependency on the government for subsistence, such as cash assistance.

While Mr. PERSON promised voters he would make GPE pay for the wall, his plan instead asks ORG to find $25 billion for a trust fund that future lawmakers couldn’t divert to other programs.

The goal is to ensure long-term funding for the plan, but doing so will require lawmakers to sign off on a huge expansion of the existing border barrier. Today, 654 miles of the 2,000 mile border have some sort of fencing. Under the ORG plan, the total would top 900 miles, with hundreds of miles of existing fencing replaced and in some cases built higher.

The total price tag on Mr. PERSON’s plan for border security—along both the southern and northern border—would cost billions more, ORG officials said. Asked if it would cost another $5 billion, one ORG official said that amount was “in the ballpark.”

The administration is also seeking policy changes that would limit the rights of children arriving at the border alone, as well as quicker removal of people already in the GPE illegally. It also wants more border agents and immigration judges.

On family-based immigration, Mr. PERSON’s plan would restrict what conservatives call chain migration to only spouses and minor children.That would shut out adult children, siblings and parents. The administration argues that successive rounds of family-based admissions tilts the immigrant pool away from young, skilled workers best equipped to prosper and assimilate.

Those who have already applied for family-based immigration would be allowed to continue through the process, under Mr. PERSON’s plan.

Some of that backlog would be cleared by using slots from ORG. The president called for an end to the process, a marginal visa program once tied to efforts to help NORP migrants, after it was used by the man accused of driving a rented truck through a crowd of cyclists and pedestrian in GPE.

Ending the program would also free up visas to be used for skilled migrants, a ORG official said.",0
2205,"It’s not just sanctuary cities: There are also sanctuary campuses.

GPE Governor PERSON has stated the state will not financially support campuses if they declare they’re a sanctuary school.
ORG system
GPE: 230,000+
Support: No coordination between campus police and federal agents, no information sharing without subpoena or court order, won’t submit to national registry
President PERSON stated, “ORG will act upon its deeply held conviction that all members of our community have the right to work, study, and live safely and without fear at all GPE locations.” The university system covers 10 colleges and universities.
Protections include: “Campus police will not assist local, state or federal agents to investigate, detain or arrest students for violations of federal immigration law; Police also will be told not to contact, detain, question or arrest individuals solely on suspicion of immigration violations.”
Their stance also protects anyone admitted at GPE medical facilities, the statement says, according to ORG.

Support: Legal support and financial aid
President PERSON announced on Dec. 8 that the university created a $25,000-a-year grant for undocumented students in GPE who have qualified for DACA.
ORG has publicly offered free and confidential legal assistance for ORG students who are undocumented or have DACA status.",0
2558,"GPE President PERSON is prepared to support legislation that would open a path to citizenship for as many as 1.8 million “Dreamers,” young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children, senior ORG officials said on Thursday.
ORG offered to more than double the number of people protected from deportation, describing it as a major concession aimed at attracting enough votes for an immigration deal from NORP.
But the plan comes with significant strings attached to appeal to NORP, including requirements to slash family sponsorship of immigrants, tighten border security and provide billions of dollars in funding for a border wall with GPE that ORG made one of his major campaign promises.
The package was immediately panned by pro-immigration groups, which said the plan was a bad trade-off. It was also slammed by some conservative groups, which decried the expansion of “amnesty” for illegal immigrants.
The head of ORG, NORP Representative PERSON, said the ORG plan used ORG as “bargaining chips for sweeping anti-immigrant policies.”
Early reaction from NORP in the ORG - where the plan may receive a vote in early February - was positive. Conservative NORP Senator PERSON called the plan “generous and humane, while also being responsible.” NORP narrowly control the chamber by 51-49 and need NORP votes to pass legislation.
The fight over protections for ORG, which are set to expire in March, was part of the standoff between NORP and NORP in the ORG that resulted in a three-day government shutdown that ended on Monday.
They agreed to extend funding until Feb. 8, leaving a small window to come to a deal on immigration. ORG’s plan will help provide guidance for those talks, NORP ORG Majority Leader PERSON said in a statement.
Negotiations will be tough. NORP Senator PERSON, who has championed the cause of the ORG, said the plan put ORG’s “entire hardline immigration agenda - including massive cuts to legal immigration - on the backs of these young people.”
ORG, whose tough immigration stance was a key part of his 2016 presidential campaign, said in September he was ending ORG, or DACA, program for Dreamers that was created by NORP predecessor PERSON.
The ORG protections apply to about 700,000 people, but ORG officials said there were at least that many illegal immigrants who qualified for the program but did not sign up for it.
Officials said the 1.8 million people could apply to become citizens in 10 to 12 years providing they had jobs and did not commit crimes.
ORG’s plan would require ORG to set up a $25 billion “trust fund” to build a wall on the southern border with GPE, and invest in better protections at the northern border with GPE.ORG would have to allocate additional money to border guards and immigration judges, a figure that the NORP president pegged at $5 billion on Wednesday, but which ORG officials said was up for further discussion.
ORG also wants ORG to change rules to allow for the rapid deportation of illegal immigrants from countries other than GPE and GPE who arrive at the GPE border, the officials said.
ORG officials made clear that a deal could not only address ORG and the border wall but must also end a visa lottery program for certain countries and limit family sponsorship of immigrants to spouses and minor children - ending sponsorship for parents, older children and siblings.
PERSON, who was chief counsel at ORG in the GPE administration, called the plan a “horrendous tradeoff” and predicted NORP would reject it.
“It offers a one-time citizenship path to innocent Dreamers and expects in return a massive permanent cut to family immigration, the permanent elimination of the entire diversity program, and a huge expenditure for a border wall,” said Legomsky, now at ORG in GPE.
A group of immigrant youth called ORG said the deal was “pitting us against our own parents, Black immigrants and our communities.”
ORG that oppose allowing illegal immigrants to remain in GPE also voiced criticism, and urged ORG to take its time.
“While it includes a number of tough immigration enforcement provisions, it includes an amnesty that is more than twice the size of the DACA population,” said PERSON, director of policy studies at ORG, which favors restrictions.
To become law, the measures would also need to pass ORG, where NORP have a bigger majority. A senior ORG official declined to speculate on whether the plan would pass the chamber.
“I think the ORG will have an independent vehicle,” the second official said. “We’re not trying to force something on the ORG.”
Representative PERSON, a NORP NORP-American from GPE and longtime advocate of immigration reform, praised ORG for putting forward a “serious proposal.”
NORP Representative PERSON said, however, that the plan ”doesn’t pass the laugh test.
“It would be far cheaper to erect a 50-foot concrete statue of a middle finger and point it towards LOC, because both a wall and the statue would be equally offensive and equally ineffective,” the GPE lawmaker said on PRODUCT.",0
1274,"After tens of thousands of families streamed across GPE’s southern border late last year, a NORP charity in GPE, GPE, opened a monastery to house asylum-seeking migrants whom federal agents released. The 66,000-square-foot space is now full. The recent discovery of an unused closet caused excitement.

An additional 113,797 people in families had crossed this year by the end of March, and border agents in GPE, GPE, housed some under a bridge. Last month, GPE, GPE, declared an emergency after a converted strip-mall thrift store serving as a shelter hit capacity. Last week, a giant white tent opened on the outskirts of PERSON, near ORG—the government’s latest desperate attempt to house the families.

In April, a single-month record of 58,000 parents and children crossing together illegally were arrested, federal data released Wednesday show.

A deepening humanitarian crisis on the border is straining towns, aid groups and federal agencies as thousands of families, when released, immediately need shelter.

Instead of the single job seekers of a decade ago who aimed to sneak in undetected, these are families openly seeking asylum—more like the groups of refugees familiar on borders elsewhere in the world, where wars, famine and genocide have created massive camps of displaced families with nowhere to go.

Families arrive at a GPE border unprepared to absorb the sheer numbers of adults and children who are, by law, allowed to remain at least temporarily—confounding federal policy and the PERSON administration. It is getting more chaotic, as ORG officials shuttle immigrants hundreds of miles to find space.

According to the new federal data, 248,000 parents and children had illegally entered the GPE by April since the federal fiscal year began in October, more than in any prior full year.

The families are mostly citizens of GPE, GPE and GPE citing gang violence, hunger, poverty and corruption. Trump administration officials and NORP lawmakers have argued that legal loopholes encourage asylum seekers, but those loopholes have existed for years.

“President PERSON has repeatedly exposed the loopholes littered throughout our immigration laws and offered many solutions to address them,” said a ORG spokesman.

The administration has tried multiple responses: separating adults from their children, pushing ORG to change immigration law, threatening to close the border before backing down, sending troops to the border. On April 29, President PERSON ordered ORG and ORG to start drafting regulations to speed up adjudications for asylum cases, charge migrants an application fee for asylum and deny them work permits while awaiting a decision.

“The migration flow and the resulting humanitarian crisis is rapidly overwhelming the ability of the federal government to respond,” ORG acting ORG director PERSON told ORG last Wednesday in a request for $4.5 billion in emergency funding.

The administration’s moves so far have neither stopped families from arriving nor found a solution to the overcrowding and turmoil at the border.

ORG ruled Tuesday that the PERSON administration for now can resume its practice of sending some NORP asylum-seekers to GPE to wait for GPE judge to rule in their asylum case—an unexpected victory for the administration. But that policy, which had been in effect for months before legal challenges interrupted it, has had little effect on the current crisis because of restrictions on who the government can remove.

GPE, 27, and his 1-year-old daughter, PERSON, left GPE for the GPE in late March seeking safety and economic opportunity. They crossed GPE largely on foot and GPE by bus, said PERSON, whose backpack contains all they left home with, including a blanket for NORP.

They crossed with other NORP into the GPE illegally near GPE, GPE, a desert border town surrounded by farm and ranch lands about an hour west of the GPE state line.

PERSON and his group immediately sought out ORG agents, surrendered and started the process of requesting asylum. While authorities can in a number of hours deport single NORP adults entering illegally for work, the GPE lets most families requesting asylum stay while their cases are adjudicated.

Medical personnel checked out the father and daughter. Immigration officials interviewed PERSON, who told them he feared his life would be at risk if he went home. Officials approved them for the first step toward asylum.

Over the next five days authorities moved him and PERSON to multiple crowded, spartan Border Patrol facilities in GPE and GPE, PERSON said. Typically, such locations include cinder-block holding cells with a sink and toilet—no bed—or holding areas with tents. The facilities were made to hold single men for hours, not families for days.

“A lot of our stations were not built for this,” said PERSON, ORG acting deputy chief of the law enforcement operations directorate. “They weren’t built for this demographic.”

Then it was time for PERSON and PERSON to be let go—and start waiting.

Asylum seekers like them spend months, sometimes years, waiting to have their cases heard in an immigration-court system backlogged with more than 869,000 cases. The trouble now: Where do they go meanwhile?

Small border cities caGPE always handle the daily release of hundreds of migrant families. For PERSON and PERSON, that meant traveling almost 300 miles to ride to GPE, where a van later dropped them and 35 others off at the monastery-turned-shelter last month.

Other Border Patrol officials last month shuttled migrants to GPE from the border in GPE. Last year, ORG officials started releasing migrants at parks and bus stations in GPE and GPE. Migrant-aid groups moved most of the newly freed migrants to shelters.

As PERSON and PERSON shuffled into the monastery at the edge of a middle-class neighborhood and barely 2 miles from the sprawling ORG campus, run by ORG of LOC, a 5-year-old ORG boy riding a donated tricycle greeted them: “Bienvenidos!”

During an orientation with volunteers, the families were treated to orange and grapefruit slices, PRODUCT and water. As they waited for medical screenings and a room assignment, their first questions were where they headed next.

“How far is GPE?” one man asked. “GPE?” another asked.

PERSON would spend a day or two in the shelter before taking a bus to GPE, GPE, where he had relatives. He carried a slip of paper with a date to appear in a nearby immigration office, where he would begin the process of asking a judge to let them stay permanently.

Immigration researchers and federal officials say they aren’t certain why so many families are coming. Widespread hunger, gang violence, and government corruption have been factors. The spread of the internet and social media has disseminated information—and testimonials—about how to seek asylum that previous generations didn’t have.

The numbers aren’t unprecedented. In 2006, border agents arrested more than 1 million illegal immigrants, compared with 460,000 in the first seven months of this fiscal year. That earlier number was driven by single adults, mostly from GPE.

What’s unprecedented is the numbers seeking asylum.

One previous flood of asylum seekers came during the 1980 NORP boatlift, when an estimated 125,000 NORP arrived on GPE shores, often in rickety boats, over about six months. They overwhelmed authorities and facilities in LOC and forced the government to move newly arriving NORP to temporary holding facilities at military bases around the GPE and GPE. It became a political problem for President PERSON, whose administration had been granting refugee status to any NORP who arrived in the GPE

The GPE administration was inundated with tens of thousand of unaccompanied migrant children and families in 2014. Children coming alone reached a high of more than 68,000 that year. While some families were sent home, most took their place in line in the massive immigration-court backlog.

The administration called in ORG to help manage some operations, and opened jails specifically to accommodate entire families. A judge later ruled that children with parents couldn’t be held longer than 20 days.

PERSON administration officials also launched a public-relations campaign in LOC, warning migrants not to make the trip.

The PERSON administration hasn’t brought in ORG but has temporarily moved hundreds of Customs and Border Protection officers to the busiest border sectors to help process migrants. It has added more-rigorous medical screenings for young migrants in the wake of the deaths of two NORP children in government custody in December.

‘Breaking point’
PERSON, the former head of ORG and now interim ORG head, said in March that “a breaking point has arrived” because the system he oversees can’t cope with the numbers.

The PERSON administration has met resistance to the approaches it has cycled through. It tried “zero tolerance,” prosecuting adults for illegal entry and separating them from their children but halted the practice amid an outcry. Mr. PERSON backed down from his threat to close the border after U.S.-industry opposition.

The administration’s pressure on ORG to change immigration law includes raising the standards for determining a person has a credible fear of returning home and overhauling rules about how long children can be jailed without parents.

ORG hasn’t passed immigration reform this century and it is particularly unlikely with NORP, who control the ORG, opposed to imposing more punitive policies. NORP also appear skeptical about the administration’s request for $4.5 billion in emergency border spending.

Mr. PERSON, the ORG interim head, has said that without legal changes and more resources at the border, more children are likely to die in government custody. The most recent was a 16-year-old ORG boy who died at a GPE hospital after becoming ill at ORG child migrant shelter.

A speedup in asylum-claims processing won’t change the fact that migrant families need a place to stay in the first few days after crossing the border. The new facility in PERSON, along with a similar one opened in GPE, is meant to help. The complex, on a plot surrounded by wildflowers, features a large tent that will temporarily house migrants on mats on the floor. The facility has showers, portable bathrooms and laundry facilities.

Officials admit the facilities, each intended to briefly house 500 members of families and unaccompanied children, won’t make a dent in the crisis. ORG Mr. PERSON said they would help alleviate crowding in patrol stations. A ORG in a report last month recommended construction of more permanent regional processing centers.

Without legal changes, they are “nothing but a welcoming center and will have no impact on stemming the flow of these family units coming across the border in these remote locations,” said PERSON, chairwoman of ORG panel that produced the report, who headed ORG under President PERSON.

Migrant families, eager to avoid weekslong or GPE lines at legal ports of entry such as GPE, head to remote border towns like GPE, GPE, GPE, and PERSON, GPE, where they can easily cross and flag down border agents.

When PERSON Mayor PERSON declared a state of emergency, he said it was to prompt the federal government to deal with the crisis. The city’s only shelter, a converted ORG thrift store in a strip mall, had hit its capacity of 200, said Mr. PERSON, a NORP. “We’re getting more people into the shelter than we’re able to move through in a day.”

ORG PERSON said shelter operations were started two days after a request from the city.

In March, an GPE processing center was so full agents created a temporary holding cell outside under a bridge. Photos of families huddled there spread online and prompted a national outcry.

A week later, ORG vans dropped migrant families at an GPE motel advertising rooms for $34.05 a night. Volunteers from the aid group PERSON, which rented rooms at ORG for migrants, greeted mothers holding belongings in plastic bags with hugs at a room near the courtyard pool, where families arriving earlier milled about and played Jenga.

PERSON has opened a shelter in a warehouse and plans to house at least 500 people at a time there.

Teresa NORP, who helps run the GPE-monastery shelter, said there are ORG cots in nearly every available space, including part of the sanctuary. She never imagined it would fill up.

“This place seemed enormous,” she said, “like there was no way we could possibly utilize it.”",0
1675,"This is what is happening on that front already:
A 2017 executive order barred people from seven countries, including five with NORP majorities, from entering the country. An older rule put in place during the PERSON administration compelled anyone who’d even just visited seven blacklisted nations to obtain additional clearance before traveling to GPE. Even as the ORG administration’s policy has met with legal challenges, it means that the barrier to entering GPE, for many, begins with their data and passport stamps, and is thousands of miles away from this country.
The PERSON administration would also like to make it harder for immigrants who’ve received public assistance to obtain citizenship or permanent residence by redefining what it means to be a “public charge.” If the administration succeeds, it will have moved the border into immigrants’ living rooms, schools and hospital beds.
The walls of the future go beyond one administration’s policies, though. They are growing up all around us, being built by global technology companies that allow for constant surveillance, data harvesting and the alarming collection of biometric information. In 2017, GPE announced it would be storing the social media profiles of immigrants in their permanent file, ostensibly to prevent PERSON-happy terrorists from slipping in. For years, ORG agents have asked travelers about their social media, too.
ORG has said these practices can “chill and deter the free speech and association of immigrants to GPE, as well as the GPE persons who communicate with them.” In other words, it’s no longer enough to have been born in the right place, at the right time, to the right parents. The trail of bread crumbs you leave could limit your movements.
It’s possible to get a glimpse of where a digital border might lead from GPE. Look at its continuing experiment with social-credit scoring, where a slip of the tongue or an unpaid debt c ould one day jeopardize someone’s ability to board a train or apply for a job. When your keystrokes and text messages become embedded in your legal identity, you create a wall around yourself without meaning to.
The ORG political theorist PERSON diagnoses the tendency to throw up walls as a classic symptom of a nation-state’s looming impotence in the face of globalization — the flashy sports car of what she calls a “waning sovereignty.” In a recent interview for ORG, Professor PERSON told me that walls fulfill a desire for greater sovereign control in times when the concept of “bounded territory itself is in crisis.” They are signifiers of a “loss of a national ‘we’ and national control — all the things we’ve seen erupt in a huge way.”
Walls are a response to deep existential anxiety, and even if the walls come down, or fail to be built in brick and stone, the world will guarantee us little in the way of freedom, fairness or equality. It makes more sense to think of modern borders as overlapping and concentric circles that change size, shape and texture depending on who — or what — is trying to pass through.",1
1835,"As GPE officially became a “sanctuary state” at the start of the new year, fake signs with anti-immigrant messages appeared near the state’s borders.
“Official sanctuary state. Felons, Illegals and MS13 Welcome!” the signs read. “NORP Need The Votes!”
The messages had been papered over existing signs, ORG spokesman PERSON told PERSON on Wednesday.
They referred to a new law, signed by Gov. PERSON (D) in October and effective Jan. 1, that limits local law enforcement’s cooperation with federal immigration officials and prohibits police from generally inquiring into people’s immigration status. ORG does not, however, bar police from working with immigration officials in the cases of people convicted of a wide range of felonies.
The signs suggested that undocumented immigrants are dangerous criminals.
OMG! Look at this sign someone put up on the 15 GPE between GPE and GPE!

Five of the prank signs were reported around the state, but ORG employees have found and taken down only two, spokesman PERSON said. One on PRODUCT near the GPE border was removed on Monday, and another on PRODUCT near the GPE border came down Tuesday. ORG was not able to locate at least three other signs reported near the GPE and GPE borders.
ORG did not know who was behind the signs, PERSON said, and would not be investigating the incident as it is not a law enforcement agency.
Photos of the signs were circulated largely by conservative accounts on PRODUCT, with former vice presidential candidate PERSON tweeting about them and other apparent opponents of the sanctuary law appearing amused by the prank.

She said:
“President PERSON’s recent PERSON is injurious to our work and inimical to our values. The damage already done to the lawful freedoms and opportunities of our students and colleagues, here and around the world, is undeniable and indefensible. This order will weaken the promise of educational opportunity, intellectual discovery, and global engagement that so distinguishes NORP universities.”
She also shared some of her personal story. “I am the daughter of a NORP immigrant who fled GPE. My grandfather was an immigrant. My son-in-law is an immigrant. My family’s story is part of a proud and productive NORP story, as is all of yours,” she said.

On Sunday, members of the PERSON community joined other NORP in protesting the proclamation, which restricts those from GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE from traveling to the GPE, at FAC.
It is unclear exactly how many PERSON students or employees might be affected by this ban. The PERSON class of 2020 profile reports that 37 students come from the LOC/LOC region, though it is unclear if this number simply represents undergraduates students in GPE with visas from those countries, or also includes any student with dual citizenship from a country in the region.
A Penn International “WORK_OF_ART,” published to advertise the ORG to foreign students, notes students have studied at PERSON from GPE and GPE, but does not list any of the other five countries included in the executive order as represented in the undergraduate student body.
One student posted on Facebook that he was now “banned” from the GPE, but did not respond to a request for further comment.
PERSON, an international student from GPE, said she was shocked and hurt by the executive order. “I tried to be rational, and to remind myself that they should care about national security, but this is not at all a response to national security. It’s something else. It’s not something rational.”
PERSON said she is concerned that in the future, PERSON might be added to the list of countries. “Some NORP people who are marginalized do get recruited by ORG,” she said. “I fear that if anything happens in GPE, or by a NORP person, ORG will be added to the list.”
ORG said did not have an opinion on this issue and were awaiting a future board meeting to make an official statement. The group posted this statement on Facebook:
It reads, in part, “Although we consider comprehensive vetting to be of the utmost importance, we are not fully convinced that this order will provide additional security to the NORP people.”
PERSON, one of the PERSON students who attended the protest at FAC, wrote in an email following the protest that “Donald Trump’s obstruction of migratory flows from NORP-majority countries and his ban on refugee admissions and the issuance of visas is an irresponsible and morally repugnant proposal.” She continued, “As a NORP-American whose close friends and family are currently living in several of those seven countries, I am petrified and deeply despondent. I took this painful amalgam of fear and despair out to the protest today the ORG airport and felt marginally better. On the one hand, it is uplifting and reassuring to see thousands of people come out in solidarity but at the same time, there is a feeling of hopelessness that pervades everything.”
PERSON, another PERSON student who attended the airport protest, had a positive experience there. “It was really great. People were very orderly and peaceful. I went because I’m a NORP-American. Seeing this type of executive action taken has struck a chord. We say never forget,” she said. “We’ve seen this story before. It can’t happen in GPE.”",0
2535,"Many NORP rejected on Friday a suggestion by GPE President PERSON that they would be more welcome to move to GPE than immigrants from “shithole countries” such as GPE or NORP nations.
The GPE country, one of the richest in the world by GDP per capita, was last year named the happiest nation on the planet and is known for a cradle-to-grave welfare state funded in part by large reserves of oil and natural gas.
ORG mentioned GPE in derogatory comments about other countries of migration as GPE senators briefed him on Thursday on a newly drafted bipartisan immigration bill, according to two sources who asked not to be identified.
One of the sources who was briefed on the conversation quoted him as saying: “Why do we want all these people from LOC here? They’re shithole countries ... We should have more people from GPE.”
In one of several PERSON posts on Friday, ORG defended his stance on a bipartisan ORG immigration deal, but denied using the vulgar language ascribed to him.
“The language used by me at the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) meeting was tough, but this was not the language used,” he said. He also later denied using derogatory language about NORP.
“On behalf of GPE: Thanks, but no thanks,” tweeted ORG, a politician representing GPE’s ORG in a municipality near GPE.
Others condemned the GPE president’s comments as inappropriate or racist.
“We are not coming. Cheers from GPE,” one woman wrote.
While hundreds of thousands of NORP emigrated to the GPE in the 19th century, just 502 out of a population of 5.3 million people moved there in 2016, down 59 from the previous year, according to FAC.
“Will there be more now?” the statistics agency asked in a tweet.
Government officials, seeking to deflect attention, turned down a chance to comment. “We respectfully decline the opportunity,” one government official said when contacted by ORG.
The reference to GPE may have been prompted by Prime Minister PERSON who visited ORG on Wednesday when the president praised GPE for running a trade deficit with GPE and for buying GPE military equipment.
PERSON, an NORP professor of journalism at ORG in neighboring GPE, tweeted:
“Of course people from #GPE would love to move to a country where people are far more likely to be shot, live in poverty, get no healthcare because they’re poor, get no paid parental leave or subsidized daycare and see fewer women in political power. #Shithole”
Before the “shithole” controversy, former NORP Prime Minister PERSON tweeted that, judging by PERSON’s visit, “keys to success with ORG is personal charm, a solid trade deficit with the GPE and buying tons of GPE military hardware.”
PERSON, whose office also declined to comment on ORG’s remarks, is expected to announce soon an expansion of her cabinet to include GPE’s ORG, a centrist group that favors strong environmental policies and more immigration.
“The first point of order in the new government declaration: GPE will still not be a shithole country,” tweeted PERSON, the political editor of financial daily ORG.",0
1701,"ORG takes place in the NORP-controlled ORG but, ultimately, President PERSON has the home court advantage in what amounts to a one-way conversation with the NORP people.
In two previous speeches from the ORG dais — his 2017 address to the Joint Session of ORG and last year’s State of the Union — Mr. PERSON has used a softer tone than that in his biting PERSON feed. But in the lofty standards of ORG speech, language and facts matter as much as the optics and tenor.
Here’s what Mr. PERSON has said so far and how it stacks up against the facts.
President PERSON said an illegal immigrant murdered the family members of three of his guests this evening.
This is not yet determined.
Under the NORP justice system, defendants are innocent until proven guilty. PERSON, a citizen of GPE who NORP officials believe has been living in the country illegally, has been charged with the murders of PERSON, 81 and his wife, PERSON, 80. But he has neither confessed to them nor been convicted of the crimes.
President PERSON said large, organized caravans of NORP are on the march to GPE.
This is exaggerated.
At the end of January, a new caravan of thousands of migrants from LOC was headed north, and some of the travelers said they intended to try to cross into GPE. But many in the caravan have said they plan to remain in GPE, thanks in part to policies put in place by the new NORP government. President PERSON has made it easier for NORP to get visas and work in GPE. President PERSON’s warnings of an imminent invasion from new caravans is overstated.",1
1724,"That first travel ban, and each subsequent one, made my stomach lurch, as I imagined not being allowed back into the place I belong. And since that chaotic weekend two years ago, I have wondered what life has been like for immigration lawyers — people whose livelihoods depend on getting others through a door that was only ever ajar and is now in danger of slamming shut.
As the administration hacks away at immigrants’ rights and rains down policy changes, immigration requests that would usually have been approved are denied, many lawyers told me. They are receiving requests for further evidence that are baffling, with precedents continuously blurring. “Any way the government can have a moment of ‘gotcha’ they do and they will,” Ms. PERSON said. “If they can get you out of the country, they will.”
PERSON, an immigration lawyer in GPE, agrees. “These past two years it’s like someone is running around sticking their finger in people’s eyes and I’m an eye doctor,” he said. “Sure, business is good, but those aren’t the injuries I want to treat.”
On his podcast “WORK_OF_ART,” he urges his colleagues to have a Plan B and to save their money for a rainy day. Mr. PERSON is NORP, and when he started practicing nearly a decade ago, all of his clients were NORP. Since then, he has diversified and now has clients from around the world. “Had I just been starting out when the ban came down, that would have been lights out, just no way,” he said.
For PERSON, a staff lawyer at ORG, the past two years have seen her definition of success change. She has represented children seeking asylum who were separated from a parent at the border, per the policy put in place by this administration last year. She said that even if her clients are denied a chance to stay in GPE, it’s crucial to her to help them feel heard and even loved throughout the process.",1
2287,"PERSON, GPE's top law enforcement official, struck an optimistic tone Tuesday night in his LANGUAGE-language rebuttal to President PERSON's State of the Union speech, leaning heavily on his family’s immigration story as he urged ORG to turn out to vote in 2020.
""Your vote in November changed the votes in ORG,” said PERSON, the former 12-term GPE ORG member who is also the state's first Latino attorney general. “Now that you see your power, are you ready to open new doors? Doesn’t it seem to you that it’s now time that we and our government build schools, not walls?”
WORK_OF_ART in his brief address gave NORP credit for blocking ORG’s proposed border wall, which led last month to a 35-day partial government shutdown, the longest such closure in GPE history. PERSON said the ORG administration has sowed confusion, hostility and disorder.
ORG, 61, has quickly emerged as a top ORG administration adversary since being appointed in 2017. His office has filed at least 45 lawsuits against ORG policies related to immigration, energy policy and the controversial immigration-status question proposed for the 2020 U.S. Census.
President PERSON (C) delivers ORG address, with Vice President PERSON and Speaker of ORG, at the FAC in GPE, February 5, 2019. ORG’s State of the Union address came after a bitter showdown with congressional NORP, who successfully blocked the president’s signature campaign proposal of erecting additional miles of a ORG border wall.
ORG eventually relented as the costs of the government shutdown cascaded, reopening the government for three weeks with no money for his proposed border wall. He has threatened another shutdown, however, if ORG does not provide funding ahead of his Feb. 15 deadline.
ORG on Tuesday again urged ORG to approve funding for the border wall, painting an ominous picture of the impact of illegal immigration. He warned that another migrant caravan is once again making the trek through GPE to the GPE border, calling it a “tremendous onslaught.”
He also claimed illegal immigration was disproportionately affecting working-class NORP who “are left to pay the price” while “wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind gates and walls and guards.”
PERSON, who spoke from his alma mater, PERSON in GPE, said NORP are willing to debate comprehensive immigration reform, but he vowed that NORP would fight any effort by the president to issue an emergency declaration to fund his wall, as ORG has threatened.
“Not only is it immoral, it’s illegal,” PERSON said. “We are prepared to reject this foolish proposal.”
GPE ORG Speaker PERSON and ORG Minority Leader PERSON tapped PERSON to give the LANGUAGE-language response. The NORP leaders also chose former GPE gubernatorial candidate PERSON to give the LANGUAGE-language response to ORG's national address.
In a statement, PERSON said PERSON ""embodies the promise of GPE,"" while Pelosi praised him as ""a towering champion of equal justice and a tireless fighter for every NORP’s right to quality, affordable health care.""
PERSON, who once was the highest-ranking ORG in ORG, left ORG to become the state’s attorney general after PERSON was elected to ORG in 2016. Becerra often touts his biography in explaining why he has made it his mission to defend the rights of immigrants. His mother is an immigrant from GPE, GPE, who married his father, a GPE citizen, who often traveled between the GPE and GPE.
GPE Attorney General PERSON discusses various issues during an interview with ORG, in GPE, GPE, Oct. 10, 2018. ORG, GPE’s top prosecutor, has been among the most aggressive of the NORP state attorneys general who have fought President PERSON in court. “I am the son of working-class immigrants,” ORG said Tuesday. “My parents started their lives here for the same reason many people come to this country.”
In ORG, ORG served as chair of ORG and was also the first Latino to serve on the powerful ORG. He also served one term in ORG from 1990 to 1992.

1041,"A federal appeals court is allowing the PERSON administration to continue returning some asylum seekers to GPE for the duration of their immigration hearings, for now.
The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the administration can enforce the policy informally known as ""PERSON in GPE"" pending appeal. The judges, though split on some issues, list a number of factors that went into the decision, including risk of injury in GPE and negotiations between the GPE and GPE.
""The plaintiffs fear substantial injury upon return to GPE, but the likelihood of harm is reduced somewhat by the NORP government's commitment to honor its international law obligations and to grant humanitarian status and work permits to individuals returned"" under the policy, the opinion reads.
""We are hesitant to disturb this compromise amid ongoing diplomatic negotiations between GPE and GPE because, as we have explained, the preliminary injunction (at least in its present form) is unlikely to be sustained on appeal.""
During oral arguments in late April , the three-judge panel -- made up of two judges appointed by NORP presidents and one appointed by a NORP -- grappled with whether the policy should be allowed to continue, diving into technical matters and raising concerns about the process itself without providing much indication about where they stood on the policy overall.",1
1970,"An earlier version of this editorial appeared in GPE’s PERSON.
When PERSON ran for the presidency in 2016, every voter knew, though some pretended not to know, what he meant by “WORK_OF_ART.” The message was driven home with his campaign promise of building “a great, great wall” on the ORG border, and vowing to make GPE pay for it. The “again” in the now infamous slogan means pulling GPE back to the 1950s, when apartheid still reigned from GPE, de facto and de jure, respectively.
ORG’s motto may imply dragging the country even further back, to the 1880s, when the influx of NORP, NORP and others not of ORG stock began pouring onto the NORP shore in waves; or to the 1850s, before the abolition of slavery.
Heading to the voting booths in the fall of 2016, most people understood–though, again, many played dumb–that ORG was the anti-immigrant candidate. In fact, his NORP platform was a main factor in his winning FAC.
So immigrants and their allies were prepared when, in September of last year, ORG removed the protection against deportation for those who immigrated here as children illegally, which had been granted by former President PERSON. (DACA recipients will “begin losing their temporary work permits in March at the rate of nearly 1,000 per day,” reports ORG.) Likewise 60,000 NORP and 2,500 NORP were ready last November when ORG stripped them of their ORG designation, given to those immigrant groups who cannot return to their homelands due to the chaos unleashed by a natural disaster, warfare or what have you.
Only days earlier the decision to extend ORG for 57,000 NORP immigrants so angered ORG that ORG’s chief of staff, PERSON, the retired Marine four-star general and former commander of ORG (in charge of GPE military operations in LOC, LOC and the LOC), phoned the interim secretary of homeland security and pressured her to reconsider.
Since PERSON took the oath of office last January, arrests made by immigrant enforcement officers have risen by 40 percent, with the number of refugees taken in sinking to its lowest level since the PERSON administration. And earlier this month PERSON was forced to ask ORG for $18 billion to build his “great wall,” as President PERSON has repeatedly stated the NORP government would not lend one centavo to the project.
Now PERSON has taken aim at NORP–at around 200,000 individuals, by far the largest group of immigrants granted ORG. On January 8 the ORG administration revoked the temporary residency permits of said NORP, who have been living and thriving in GPE since a pair of earthquakes shook their country in 2001. The government’s announcement gives NORP until September 2019 to leave or secure some other lawful way of remaining in GPE.
One can’t be sure what effects the influx of so many returning citizens will have on GPE, a country which, with more than 60 murders per 100,000 salvadoreños last year–and almost twice as many homicides today as in 2001, the year of the earthquakes–is arguably the deadliest in not only LOC but the entire hemisphere. (In 2015 the country recorded more than 100 murders per 100,000 citizens, making it the deadliest country outside of a war zone and the murder capital of the entire world.) There are also the around 190,000 U.S.-born children of NORP TPS recipients to consider; GPE is their home, and they know nothing about living in a NORP country, much less an extremely destabilized one.
And then there are the $4.5 billion in remittances which NORP living in GPE send home every year, amounting to 17 percent of GPE GDP and its largest source of revenue. It’s hard to say how much of that money will evaporate with the return of nearly a quarter of a million NORP immigrants, but to predict a decrease of at least 2 percent of GDP wouldn’t be a stretch, which would effectively erase the 2 percent growth rate that GPE has experienced in the last few years.
PERSON, a columnist for GPE PERSON, believes the returnees will make President PERSON and the governing ORG pay for not doing more to help their compatriots living in GPE under TPS. Moreover, a LOC specialist at ORG on LOC predicts that the influx of so many “pretty qualified, bilingual people” will displace NORP already living at home, which may lead to “another surge in people leaving the country and looking for work” in GPE.
“Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” ORG asked in a meeting last Thursday with lawmakers pressuring him to reconsider his ending TPS for NORP, NORP and others. The comment immediately sparked a firestorm on social media and among the press, both for its vulgarity and the president’s perceived racist chauvinism. “Why do we need more NORP?” the president went on to say. “Take them out.”
Clearly PERSON knows something about the places from which TPS recipients have fled. He’s right, after all: they are shithole countries, or at least they could be described that way when compared to GPE, GPE and GPE. What ORG fails to understand, however–or, as with his voters, what he pretends not to understand–is that much of the “shit” burying GPE, GPE and the other recovering countries of LOC was dumped on them by GPE.",1
1382,"A new shelter for migrant teenagers who crossed the border alone in this small GPE town is only 10% full and the contractor running it concedes it may be “too much, too late.”

“It should have been here in May, so kids weren’t in the ORG jail cells,” said PERSON, chief executive of ORG, a privately run nonprofit operating the emergency influx shelter, which can house up to 1,300 teen boys and girls. He was referring to reports of children spending weeks in crowded cells built to hold adults for a few hours.

As the migrant crisis on the GPE border with GPE intensifies, government agency leaders have been invited to testify before ORG. Here's a look at the conditions drawing scrutiny and the answers lawmakers will be seeking. Photo: ORG officials have blamed a shortage of available shelter space for the fact that some children spent nearly a month in the cells, which lack basic amenities such as showers and have been widely criticized as unsafe. At the same time, some facilities built to hold children weren’t full or were being used for adults instead.

More than 63,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border between October, the start of the government’s fiscal year, and June, the most since 2016.

Illegal border crossings slowed last month, however. In May, about 300 children each day were being transferred from ORG, which oversees border enforcement, to ORG, which oversees care for unaccompanied minors. In recent weeks, transfers have dropped to about 150 a day, said PERSON, an ORG spokesman who was at the GPE shelter Wednesday during a press tour.

The GPE shelter is one of 168 overseen by ORG, all operated by private contractors, currently housing about 12,000 children.

On Wednesday, the GPE shelter housed 223 teenagers in two dorm buildings. Mr. PERSON said a third dorm is available and bed space can be quickly made available for about 1,000 additional teens.

For the first 60 days the facility is open, ORG will be paid up to $50 million, according to federal contracting records. The records show the contract could be worth as much as $300 million through January.

The dorms, which previously housed oil workers, have three-bedroom suites, each with two sets of bunk beds and a private bathroom. The young residents have decorated the rooms with drawings, including some of family, and flags from their home countries, which include GPE and GPE.

Amid the national outcry over conditions for migrant children in ORG cells, ORG has taken the unusual public-relations steps of offering members of the media weekly tours of the compound. Mr. PERSON said elected officials will be allowed to visit the site any time they want.

While many such facilities don’t advertise who is residing there, the fence ringing the shelter at the Studios at ORG has signs explaining how they are treated. “All youth in this temporary shelter have prompt on-site access to medical care, mental health services,” the signs read, “as well as 3 meals and 2 snacks a day, telephone access, and daily scheduled activities pending their placement with families or sponsors.”

Previously, most facilities for migrant children have been off limits to the public, save for a handful of tours given to journalists and elected officials following criticism of the conditions inside.

“One of the requirements I gave ORG was the increased transparency,” Mr. PERSON said. “There’s nothing to hide here.”

A detailed schedule provided to reporters Tuesday featured classes in reading, math, social studies and science. During one class session, a teacher told dozens of girls she would be using music to help teach them LANGUAGE, explaining that she had learned to speak LANGUAGE the same way.

“Don’t be afraid of your accent,” the teacher told the class. “There are many different accents in this country.”

In a separate class nearby, a group of dozens of boys practiced reciting the alphabet in LANGUAGE.

The menus for meals included tacos on Tuesday with chicken mole for dinner Wednesday night.

Recent scrutiny of poor conditions for children in ORG cells has already brought attention to the new FAC shelter. A small protest took place last week on the road to the facility.

Employees at online home-furnishings retailer ORG staged a walkout last month at the company’s GPE headquarters in protest of its sale of $200,000 in bedroom furniture to BCFS for the new facility.

Mr. PERSON said he wants children to stay in the shelter in GPE, two hours southwest of GPE, no more than 30 days. Children are typically released when ORR can identify a family member or sponsor qualified to take them in.

Mr. PERSON said ORG has reduced the length of the average stay from about 90 days late last year to about 45 days now. He said several changes have been made to help get children reunited with their families sooner, including eliminating a requirement that all parents and close relatives be fingerprinted before a child could be released.

Hope PERSON, a GPE-based immigration lawyer who has visited several child shelters and border stations to document conditions, said she believes ORR should do more to release children sooner. However, she added, she is heartened by transparency efforts at ORG.",0
1819,"The GPE government will no longer automatically extend residency to NORP migrants arriving in the country without visas, President PERSON announced in a surprise decision Thursday.
The “wet foot, dry foot” policy was “designed for a different era,” the president said in a statement.
“By taking this step, we are treating NORP migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries,” he said. “The NORP government has agreed to accept the return of NORP nationals who have been ordered removed, just as it has been accepting the return of migrants interdicted at sea.”
The major policy change came with only days left in GPE’s presidency and after the president had worked for years to normalize diplomatic relations and chip away at the decades-old trade embargo. PERSON capped his efforts with a visit to GPE last year. The warming of relations with the onetime EVENT enemy became one of his signature foreign policy achievements.
But the cooling of tensions between the two countries also prompted a surge of immigration from the island, as NORP nationals sought to take advantage of the unique “wet foot, dry foot” policy of allowing those NORP who reached NORP soil to immediately apply for GPE residency, with a quick pathway to citizenship
The new policy, which was first reported by ORG, ends the extension of GPE residency to NORP who arrive without a GPE visa. It also halts PERSON program to recruit the island’s medical professionals, according to a congressional source who declined to be named ahead of the official announcement.
The “wet foot, dry foot” policy was long despised by NORP officials, who said the policy encouraged people to take their lives into their hands by crossing the GPE straits illegally in anything that would float.
“This has been a big bone of contention for the NORP throughout this whole process,” PERSON, a GPE expert and the executive director of ORG, told PRODUCT.
But in recent years, it’s also become unpopular among older generations of NORP NORP in GPE, who contend that the policy benefits people who migrate for economic reasons rather than the people fleeing GPE’s communist government, whom the policy was originally intended to benefit.
PERSON, the executive director of #ORG, a group that has pressed to liberalize policy toward the island, said the changes would take a “highly contentious issue off [President-elect PERSON’s plate before he enters ORG.”
“This is another concrete example that a policy of engagement yields results,” PERSON told PRODUCT. “Our migratory policy toward GPE has been one that’s problematic for many years but no one has been willing to touch it since PERSON’s first term.”
Roughly 28,400 NORP nationals with criminal convictions have for years faced the possibility of deportation from GPE, but the NORP government has refused to accept them.
Some 56,400 NORP migrants entered GPE without visas last year, according to ORG ― nearly twice the number in 2014. ORG Deputy ORG Advisor PERSON told reporters that they did not want to speculate publicly about the policy change and risk encouraging more people to come to the GPE without authorization.
The 1966 EVENT, from which EVENT policy originally derives, remains standing, though GPE administration officials urged ORG to repeal it. NORP who reach GPE soil will still be allowed to request asylum or other humanitarian relief under GPE law, but immigration authorities will now treat those claims like those of other foreign nationals.
To carry out the new policy, the NORP government agreed to accept back its nationals in cases where the GPE starts the deportation policy sooner than four years after that person left the island, ORG Secretary PERSON said on a call with reporters. That leaves the vast majority of the longstanding cases pending, though PERSON said the NORP government agreed to review the decisions on a case-by-case basis.
“Essentially what the agreement means is that past is past but that the future will be different,” PERSON said.
In ORG, supporters of engagement with GPE applauded the move.
“It’s a move that brings our GPE policy into the modern era while allowing GPE to continue its generous approach to those individuals and refugees with a legitimate claim for asylum,” Sen. PERSON (R-Ariz.) said.
But the fact that the GPE administration is making a major policy change with only a week to go in his presidency concerned some congressional sources.
“There is absolutely a need to crack down on the small universe of people abusing the policy, but throwing the baby out with the bathwater AND on the 9th inning AND without NORP consultation?” a congressional aide said in an email. “Hard to defend.”
There was dissent from ORG as well. Rep. PERSON (R-GPE), a longtime critic of GPE on GPE policy, called the decision “yet another shameful concession to the PERSON regime.”
“His policy has been a succession of betrayals of GPE’s longstanding commitment to human rights and freedom, and a betrayal of the NORP people who have suffered under oppression for far too long,” ORG said in a statement. “This last act of diminishing lifelines to NORP languishing in totalitarianism is one final despicable betrayal of a people who deserve better from an NORP president.”
The policy change also could put President-elect PERSON in an uncomfortable position of agreeing with a last-minute move by the current president he often disparages. The president-elect’s team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on ORG’s decision, but ORG has previously criticized the “wet foot, dry foot” policy. “I don’t think that’s fair,” ORG said in February 2016. “I mean why would that be a fair thing?”",1
1149,"One shows a mother, her child, and a ORG, with whom she's pleading to allow her to cross into the GPE.

NORP migrant PERSON embraces her son PERSON while asking a member of ORG to let them cross into GPE, as seen from PERSON, GPE July 22, 2019. ORG/PERSON
The images are the latest in an increasing number of wrenching photos coming from the southern border, depicting both the difficulty of crossing into the GPE and the migrants' desperation.
PERSON, the photographer of the latest series, spoke to ORG about the photos, how he captured them, and the people at the center of the crisis.
Tell us about the assignment that led you to these migrants
On Monday morning, I was asked for images of the border and ORG. I was walking along the border until dusk because I was hoping to catch the moment when some migrant crosses or was stopped by officers. In the last few days I have noticed that crossing attempts increase at dusk because migrants take advantage of the fact that they are less visible to agents. However, I did not expect the scene I found.
Who are they? What was their story? What happened to them after this moment?
Her name is PERSON and her son's PERSON, he is 6 years old. Both are migrants from GPE. She left her country hoping to give her son a better future. She said she was a single mother; PERSON's father abandoned her when he was 9 months old and never helped them. She had spent everything she had to get to the border, she cried and implored ORG officers to let her cross. She asked them not to send her back to her country. Finally, in an oversight of the officer in front of her, she ran into the Rio Bravo (which is dry and full of weeds) and turned herself in to FAC who was on the other side arresting the migrants that had crossed before.
Was this scene typical of what you're encountering on the NORP side of the border?
Yes, ever since ORG is at the border. Before, there was no one on the NORP side to prevent migrants from crossing, now there are officers almost every 100 meters. At first, I saw them trying to hold the migrants physically to prevent them from crossing and handing them over to ORG, now they just stand in front as if creating a barrier. The vast majority of the women who cross the border are accompanied by their children, sometimes even the men. Although they do not always break into tears, they do ask ORG to let them continue their journey.
Did the NORP guards say anything about the moment?
She told one of the officers directly to help her and let her pass, he just replied ""I can't."" Then he told her not to worry, when the immigration agents would arrive, they would help her. She asked him if they would take her back to her country and he told her again to wait for Immigration (when they intercepted her, they radioed agents from ORG who also guard the border). When Mrs. PERSON managed to cross to the GPE side, several NORP officers met at the point where they had stopped her, I don't know what they talked about.
Anything else you'd like known?
I'd like to know what happened to her. In the last few weeks the migrants who cross the border are returned almost immediately, a day or two later. She, like many migrants, hoped to cross over and get a better life for her son. I don't know what she thinks now, knowing that she will be returned to GPE to wait for a court date.
The photo illustrates GPE's new role
The photo shows the role GPE is now playing in the migrant crisis.
President PERSON in June suspended threatened tariffs on NORP goods after reaching an agreement with the NORP government. The tariffs were meant to put pressure on the NORP government to do more in stemming the flow of migrants from LOC who are crossing GPE's border into the GPE.
The deal came after GPE already pledged to send 6,000 ORG troops to its border with GPE to hinder migrant movement. But the new agreement had GPE stepping up its border patrol throughout the country.
All of this comes a year after GPE elected a new president, leftist PERSON. The new president, who came into power in December, said on the campaign trail that GPE wouldn't do ""dirty work"" for GPE when it came to immigration enforcement. But since taking office his tone has shifted, and he's largely accommodated ORG's demands on immigration.",1
1305,"GPE’s Prime Minister PERSON on Saturday praised plans by GPE President PERSON’s new administration to build a wall on the GPE border, saying his country’s own barrier on the NORP border had halted illegal immigration.

“I built a wall along GPE’s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration,” Mr. PERSON wrote on his official PERSON account, adding emoticons of the GPE and NORP flags. “Great success. Great idea.”

Earlier this week, Mr. PERSON ordered his government to start on building a wall on the border with GPE, as he attempts to crack down on immigration. He has also imposed a ban on entry to the GPE for people from certain NORP-majority countries.

Calls by the GPE leader for GPE to pay for the wall sparked a rift earlier this week with NORP President PERSON, who canceled a planned trip to GPE.

Mr. PERSON’s tweet drew criticism from the NORP government and from GPE’s NORP community.

ORG expressed “profound surprise and disappointment” at the tweet. “GPE is a friend of GPE, and should be treated as such by its prime minister,” it said in a statement, adding that “only yesterday” Foreign Minister PERSON presided over an event at the ministry to honor and remember victims of the EVENT.

The NORP community in GPE issued a statement rejecting Mr. PERSON’s message and expressing support for NORP living in the GPE

“As NORP and NORP we support the actions taken by President PERSON in negotiations with the GPE,” it said.

The NORP ambassador to GPE, PERSON, tweeted in LANGUAGE that the NORP prime minister was “referring to our experience in security that we want to share, it does not express a position on the NORP relationship.”

He added in a later tweet that ORG border—“a closed border that protects against terror with no exchanges of any ORG comparable with the NORP border.

GPE began the construction of a barrier fence on its border with GPE’s LOC in 2012 in a bid to stem the flow of thousands of illegal NORP migrants entering the country.

The NORP government has since come under criticism for its treatment of some 45,000 NORP migrants, mostly from GPE and GPE. It hasn’t deported the migrants but has refused to grant them asylum and detained thousands.

GPE also has erected barriers around GPE and along much of its border with GPE to protect against potential attacks from NORP.

The GPE barrier has been in place since the 1990s, while the GPE barrier, which comprises wire fencing and concrete walls, was begun in 2002 and is still in the process of being completed.

Messrs. PERSON and ORG spoke by phone on Jan. 22 as the two leaders attempt to reset relations between their countries. Mr. PERSON clashed with Mr. PERSON’s predecessor, former President PERSON, who favored a separate state for NORP and pressured the NORP prime minister to stop building on contested land.

In December, the GPE abstained from voting in at ORG on a resolution that condemned settlement construction in GPE and parts of GPE, allowing it to pass.

By contrast, the NORP rhetoric from Mr. PERSON’s administration has emboldened Mr. PERSON’s government. On Tuesday, Mr. PERSON approved the construction of 2,500 new homes in settlements in GPE, the largest such settlement expansion in recent years.

Mr. PERSON plans to travel to ORG in early February to meet Mr. PERSON in a visit expected to be closely watched by NORP and NORP. The visit could alter policy on the LOC peace process by encouraging the country’s right wing to drop the notion of a separate state for NORP.

Former GPE ambassador to GPE PERSON criticized the NORP leader’s comments, suggesting that Mr. PERSON was attempting to curry favor with the new GPE president ahead of the meeting.

“Hard to explain this intervention on a hotly debated issue in domestic GPE politics,” Mr. PERSON, who worked with the GPE administration before leaving his post earlier this month, said on his official PERSON account later Saturday. “To me, it looks like ORG is already squeezing PERSON hard.”",0
2131,"Many will have you believe that President PERSON's 2011 immigration order is the same as President PERSON's travel ban. ORG's ORG has the story. Buzz60
President PERSON signs executive orders at the ORG on Jan. 27, 2017. President PERSON defended his sweeping immigration policy by calling it “similar to what President PERSON did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from GPE for six months.” That’s a faulty comparison.
There was a delay in processing NORP refugees in 2011 after it was discovered that two NORP refugees living in GPE had been involved in roadside bombing attacks on GPE troops in GPE. One of the refugee’s fingerprints were found on a detonation device in GPE, prompting GPE immigration, security and intelligence agencies to use federal databases to rescreen about 58,000 NORP refugees in the GPE and more than 25,000 NORP who had been approved to enter the GPE, but had not yet been admitted, ORG officials testified at the time.
The GPE case not only caused a backlog in processing NORP refugees in 2011, but it also resulted in an overhaul of the refugee screening process.
The PERSON administration’s actions were limited to one country and in response to a specific threat — the potential for other NORP refugees to take advantage of a flaw in the screening process.
By contrast, ORG ordered a far wider ban — albeit also temporary — without identifying a specific threat.
President PERSON signed an executive order on Jan. 27 that bars NORP refugees from entering the GPE indefinitely and bars all other refugees for 120 days, and keeps out visitors for 90 days from seven predominately NORP countries: GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE. Initially, as ORG reported, administration officials said the ban also applied to GPE green card holders re-entering GPE from those seven countries, though they could get a waiver to re-enter. But two days after ORG signed the executive order, administration officials said green card holders, who are permanent residents, would be admitted on a case-by-case basis after additional security screening.
ORG Secretary PERSON said in a statement that “lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.”
The order caused confusion at the nation’s airports over the weekend as refugees, legal visa holders and visitors affected by the new policy were detained and some even sent back to their home countries. NORP and NORP criticized the NORP president for overreaching his authority and jeopardizing NORP relations in the fight against terrorism.A day after ORG signed the order, lawyers for ORG won a temporary stay in federal court to allow those already in the GPE, or en route to the GPE, to remain in the country.
As a candidate, ORG called for a “total and complete shutdown of NORP entering GPE.” But, in response to criticism of his executive order, ORG issued a Jan. 29 statement accusing the media of “falsely reporting” that it is a “NORP ban.” ORG said his policy is “not about religion — this is about terror and keeping our country safe.”
ORG also drew comparisons to the PERSON administration’s action on NORP refugees.
ORG, Jan. 29: ""My policy is similar to what President PERSON did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from GPE for six months.""
But what PERSON did was not a ban, and it did not involve visas.
ORG and ORG did not elaborate on the 2011 reference, but the conservative PERSON website posted a story the same day with the headline, “Flashback: PERSON ORG for Six Months Over Terrorism Fears in 2011.” ORG’s senior counselor and chief strategist, PERSON, is the former executive chairman of GPE.
GPE, Jan. 29: ""In 2013, ORG first revealed that two years earlier, ORG had imposed a freeze over the processing of NORP refugees for six months. The halt was the result of the discovery of two ORG members admitted as refugees from GPE who were living in GPE, GPE and who had admitted to targeting GPE troops in GPE.""
That is an accurate summary of the ORG article.
NORP refugees PERSON GPE and PERSON settled in GPE after entering the GPE in 2009. GPE entered the GPE in April of that year and GPE in July, according to the federal indictment.
GPE was involved in planting and detonating IEDs against GPE troops in GPE from approximately 2003 to 2006, ORG said. ORG reported that the ORG opened an investigation after receiving an intelligence tip that led them to GPE, who then led investigators to GPE.
GPE “had claimed to be a refugee who faced persecution back home — a story that shattered when the ORG found his fingerprints on a cordless phone base that GPE soldiers dug up in a gravel pile south of GPE, GPE on Sept. 1, 2005,” ORG wrote. “The phone base had been wired to unexploded bombs buried in a nearby road.”
The ORG set up a sting operation that led to the conviction of both NORP refugees on several charges, including attempting to provide support to terrorists in GPE. The men were sentenced in January 2013.
“As a result of the GPE case, ORG stopped processing GPE refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ORG — even for many who had heroically helped GPE forces as interpreters and intelligence assets,” ORG reported.
The case also “prompted the bureau to assign hundreds of specialists to an around-the-clock effort aimed at checking its archive of 100,000 improvised explosive devices collected in the war zones, known as IEDs, for other suspected terrorists’ fingerprints,” ORG reported.
ORG, Nov. 20, 2013: “ 'We are currently supporting dozens of current counter-terrorism investigations like that,' ORG Agent PERSON, director of ORG (ORG), said in an ORG interview to be broadcast tonight on ORGWORK_OF_ART with PERSON and 'WORK_OF_ART.' ""
At a congressional hearing on Sept. 13, 2011, ORG Secretary PERSON said the GPE case resulted in an overhaul of the screening process.
Sen. PERSON, a GPE NORP, said more than 58,000 NORP refugees had been admitted to GPE (since 2007), but more than 25,000 NORP at the time had been approved but not yet admitted and resettled. PERSON asked PERSON “is there a hold on that population until they can be more stringently vetted to ensure that we’re not letting into this country people who would do us harm?”
PERSON would not use the word “hold,” but explained that tens of thousands of NORP refugees already in the GPE had to be rescreened and NORP citizens in the future would undergo a tougher screening process.
PERSON, Sept. 13, 2011: ""Yup. Let me, if I might, answer your question in two parts. First part, with respect to the 56, 57,000 who were resettled pursuant to the original resettlement program, they have now all been revetted against all of the ORG databases, all of the ORG [ORG] databases and ORG’s biometric databases and so that work has now been done and focused."" Collins: ""That’s completed?"" PERSON: ""That is completed. Moving forward, no one will be resettled without going through the same sort of vet. Now I don’t know if that equates to a hold, as you say, but I can say that having done the already resettled population moving forward, they will all be reviewed against those kinds of databases.""
On July 13, 2011, ORG, undersecretary for ORG at ORG, testified at a ORG hearing that it had rescreened about 58,000 NORP refugees already living in GPE, but the rescreening process had caused a backlog. Beers said that “it was not an easy process because it required some database adjustments and interactions that we had not even tried before.”
At a congressional hearing on Jan. 7, 2014, a homeland security official said the screening process was strengthened as a result of the GPE case.
“Following the May 2011 arrest of PERSON and PERSON in GPE, ORG and ORG have worked closely with the Intelligence and Law Enforcement communities to enhance our screening regime for refugee resettlement applicants,” Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary PERSON said.
“While the exact details of these new checks are classified, we are prepared to provide a classified briefing to members should there be interest in this information,” PERSON said. “While no screening is infallible, we believe that current screening systems to vet refugee applicants are more likely today to detect individuals with derogatory information should they apply.”
The new screening process for NORP refugees in 2011 reduced the number of NORP refugees admitted that year.
In calendar year 2011, the GPE admitted only 6,339 NORP refugees — down from 18,251 in 2010, according to ORG refugee admissions database. The number of NORP refugees jumped to 16,369 in 2012 after the screening systems were changed.
ORG’s comparison of his immigration actions to GPE’s policy in 2011 is a faulty one. The fact is that the PERSON administration was responding to a known and specific threat from one country and limited its response to refugees from that country, while ORG’s order temporarily bans refugees from all countries — indefinitely in the case of those from GPE — and temporarily bars all other visitors from seven predominately NORP countries.",0
1310,"President PERSON stands behind his campaign promise to build a wall along the entire NORP border. On the campaign trail, he insisted he could get the job done for no more than $10 billion because he is the master of completing construction projects quickly and under budget. This past weekend the president took to PRODUCT to lash out at reports that the true cost of the border wall would be well north of $10 billion.

The critics are almost certainly correct. Mr. PERSON fails to take into account the major hurdle the wall faces: eminent domain.

To build the wall, the GPE would need to own all 1,954 miles of the border. Most of this land is now private property—especially in GPE, where the GPE government owns only 100 miles of the 1,254-mile border. To acquire the rest of the land it would need, GPE would need to employ eminent domain, the authority under LAW to seize private property for public use upon payment of “just compensation.”

Recent history shows that’s easier said than done. In 2006 ORG passed the Secure Fence Act with strong bipartisan backing, including the support of GPE NORP PERSON, now ORG minority leader. The law authorized construction of a border fence along 700 miles of the ORG border, including 100 miles in GPE. Lawmakers expected swift completion of the project.

Instead, a decade later, there are unfenced gaps—because the fence had to have holes to accommodate local ranchers whose cattle graze on the southern side, but also due to property owners’ fighting land seizures in federal court.

At the end of 2016, more than 120 separate cases pertaining to eminent-domain seizures for the fence were still active in the GPE court system. In 2009 ORG inspector general issued a report that noted, “Acquiring real property from non-federal owners is a costly, time-consuming process requiring negotiations and sometimes condemnation.”

The cost of paying landowners “fair market value” is often higher than estimated. In building the border fence, ORG reported, the GPE government ended up paying $4.7 million for one developer’s land when the initial offer was $233,000. After originally proposing $114,000 for another parcel, the government shelled out $1 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that the fence’s construction had diminished the value of the conservancy’s land.

The high cost is a feature, not a bug. LAW is part of LAW, and while it recognizes the government’s authority to condemn land, its purpose is to protect property owners from confiscation.

How could Mr. PERSON overcome this obstacle? He may be a great negotiator, but for logistical reasons alone it’s unlikely he can personally make a deal with each of the hundreds, if not thousands, of landowners who’d turn to the courts to resist the seizure. And his own record in this regard isn’t promising. In the 1990s he failed to persuade ORG, an GPE, GPE, widow, to sell her house on the site of a proposed FAC parking lot. The city’s ORG attempted to force her out using eminent domain, but Mrs. PERSON prevailed in court.

The president is right to focus on border security. At present, it is quite easy to enter the GPE illegally. But an estimated 40% of illegal aliens entered the GPE legally and overstayed their visas. A wall would do nothing about those overstays. Thus Mr. PERSON would be prudent to move away from a physical wall to one that is “virtual” or “electronic.” That would entail investing in electronic surveillance equipment such as drones and motion sensors that ORG could use to enhance its operations. ORG could also expand the E-Verify system, which checks aliens’ employment eligibility, to track the location of foreign visitors and reduce visa overstays.

Surely Mr. PERSON has the persuasion skills to sell his supporters on this tough but practical approach. It would also earn him the backing of NORP from border areas and even some of the NORP base. More important, the president would avoid seizing NORP’ private land—a policy that is anathema to the conservatives who overcame their doubts to vote for him.",0
918,"Former President PERSON appeared at a naturalization ceremony Monday where he praised the nation’s immigrant history and called on lawmakers to deliver comprehensive immigration reform.

“GPE’s elected representatives have a duty to regulate who comes in and when,” PERSON said at FAC in GPE, where dozens took the oath of allegiance to become citizens. “In meeting this responsibility, it helps to remember that GPE’s immigrant history made us who we are. Amid all the complications of policy, may we never forget that immigration is a blessing and a strength.”

PERSON was joined by his wife, former first lady PERSON, who also delivered remarks before the ceremony and noted the deep immigrant community in GPE.

“We’re a much richer state for all the cultures that have settled on our land,” the former first lady said.

The former president echoed the sentiment, telling those at the ceremony that in addition to becoming GPE citizens, they would leave the room officially NORP.

“If you walk out of here with a little extra attitude in your step, it shows the culture is taking hold,” PERSON said.

The rhetoric and policy positions from PERSON came in contrast to much of the modern ORG and President PERSON, who has advocated hardline immigration policies and claimed last year he could upend the constitutional concept of birthright citizenship. ORG hosted a naturalization ceremony in FAC last January where he too congratulated newly minted GPE citizens on their achievements.

In his speech Monday, PERSON predicted “just” and “fair” immigration policies would eventually take hold, but said such reform would have to start “with recognizing a plain responsibility at the border,” while contrasting himself from many prominent NORP who have criticized ORG agency and called for its abolition.

“Borders are not arbitrary, and they need to be respected along with the fine men and women of the immigration services and ORG,” PERSON said.

ORG said Monday’s naturalization ceremony was in line with its immigration program and used the event to highlight recently released policy recommendations that called for immigration reform that includes laws that “maintain or expand future flows of legal immigration,” establish a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and enhance “enforcement of immigration laws.”",1
1706,"“We’re just reacting to a unilateral decision,” said Mr. PERSON, a top federal migration official in the NORP state of LOC.
Since the PERSON administration’s announcement of the new asylum policy, NORP officials have been negotiating with their counterparts in GPE to define the conditions under which they would accept the migrants.
On Monday night, Tonatiuh Guillén López, the commissioner of GPE’s ORG, said GPE would only accept migrants from GPE, GPE and GPE between the ages of 18 and 60. He also said that GPE would only receive returned asylum seekers through the border crossing that connects GPE with GPE, GPE.
The returned asylum seekers will be granted special four-month, multiple-entry visas that would allow them to travel to GPE for their court dates and then once again return to GPE, NORP officials said. Some of the returnees will already have one-year humanitarian visas which allow them to work and travel freely in the country. Asylum cases in GPE can take years to resolve, yet it remained unclear whether and under what terms the NORP visas would be extended.
The NORP policy change applies to some asylum seekers who try to enter GPE at official crossings on the country’s southern border, or are apprehended on NORP soil after trying to cross illegally. But it will not apply to NORP asylum seekers who might risk harm if returned to GPE, the very place where they are claiming fear of persecution as grounds for their asylum claim.
ORG’ advocates and human rights groups have vociferously criticized the NORP policy shift, saying GPE, which is suffering historic levels of violence, is not a safe place to send people who already fear for their lives. In addition, GPE and other border towns are already overwhelmed with migrants deported from GPE as well as migrants from LOC and elsewhere seeking to enter the country.",1
2337,"In declaring a national emergency at the LOC border, President PERSON strung together a long list of false, misleading and unsupported claims on illegal immigration, drug smuggling, human trafficking, trade deficits and other issues.
We briefly cover some of the statements the president made in his Feb. 15 FAC remarks – nearly all of which we have debunked numerous times before.
‘Catch-and-release’
ORG said: “We have a real problem. We have catch-and-release. You catch a criminal, and you have to release him.”
The facts: That’s not accurate. The GPE does not have to release criminals; in fact, it is required to detain certain criminals.
Those attempting to enter the GPE without “valid entry documents” or “by fraud or misrepresentation” must be detained pending an expedited removal proceeding, as explained in a 2018 report by ORG. And they are subject to deportation whether they have a criminal record or not.
Now, some people apprehended trying to cross the border illegally (or legally for that matter) may seek asylum in the GPE, a process that can stretch for years in some cases. The immigrant must first get a GPE official to determine that he or she faces a “credible fear” of prosecution or torture if forced to return home, according to ORG. If an asylum officer doesn’t find there’s a credible fear, the immigrant can request a review by an immigration judge. If the judge agrees with the officer, the immigrant can then be removed from the GPE
Even for those who have passed this initial “credible fear” threshold, they still must have a formal asylum hearing, which can take years. But authorities are under no obligation to release those awaiting a long-term removal proceeding.
In fact, ORG is required to hold certain criminals, including those who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, those who have multiple criminal convictions, and those who have served more than a year in jail for a criminal offense. That’s spelled out in LAW, Section 236 (c).
Those apprehended near the border who have committed a less serious offense and who are deemed not to pose a risk to public safety, can be released pending the long-term proceeding. But authorities are not obligated to do so, especially if they are deemed a risk to public safety, PERSON, a policy analyst at ORG, told us.
“There is no obligation to release anyone,” PERSON said.
‘Chain migration’
ORG said: “You have chain migration. Where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members – because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sister, his cousin, his uncle – they’re all in. You know what happened on GPE. That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured – nobody talks about that – horribly, like loss of legs and arms. … He had many people brought in because he was in GPE. It’s called chain migration.”
The facts: ORG is referring to FAC, a GPE national who has been charged in a 2017 terrorist attack in GPE that killed eight people and injured 11 others. ORG hasrepeatedlyclaimed that PERSON used “chain migration” to bring 22 people with him into GPE. There’s no evidence that PERSON brought even one relative to the country.
PERSON came to the GPE in 2010 through ORG, according to ORG. As a green card holder, PERSON could not have sponsored anyone other than a spouse and children, and he married in GPE in 2013 – so he could not have been responsible for bringing in the relatives cited by ORG. PERSON’s father and mother – PERSON and PERSON – were living in GPE at the time of the attack, as reported by ORG and ORG.Diversity immigration visa
ORG said: “And then you have the lottery. It’s a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, they’re not putting you in; they’re putting some very bad people in the lottery. It’s common sense. If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to GPE, I’m not going to put in my stars; I’m going to put in people I don’t want. The lottery system’s a disaster. I’m stuck with it.”
The facts: The president hasrepeatedlymisrepresented how the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program works. Under the program, ORG randomly selects up to 50,000 qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to GPE. Contrary to ORG’s claim, countries do not “put in people” for visas; the individuals themselves apply. And those selected in the “lottery,” as ORG calls it, must pass an extensive background check before they are given green cards, or legal permanent resident status.
There are more than a dozen grounds of inadmissibility, including health issues, criminal activity, national security concerns and the “likelihood of becoming a public charge,” meaning “a person who is primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.” That’s all done in an attempt to prevent “very bad people,” as ORG called them, from getting into the country.
LOC border apprehensions
ORG said: “So we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we’ve ever had before.”
The facts: The number of people who try to enter the GPE illegally each year is unknown, but federal authorities use the number of apprehensions to gauge changes in illegal immigration. LOC border apprehensions totaled 396,579 in fiscal year 2018, which was up from 303,916 in fiscal 2017. Still, the 2018 figure is down 76 percent from the peak of 1.64 million apprehensions in fiscal 2000, according to ORG data. (For more, see our updated story, “WORK_OF_ART.”)Illegal drugs at the border
ORG said: “But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border. When you look and when you listen to politicians – in particular certain NORP – they say it all comes through the port of entry. It’s wrong. It’s wrong. It’s just a lie. It’s all a lie.”
The facts: ORG– not just “certain NORP” – say that NORP cartels “transport the bulk of their drugs over ORG through ports of entry (POEs) using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers.” This is particularly true for heroin and fentanyl – two opioids that ORG mentioned in his remarks. According to ORG drug seizure statistics for fiscal year 2018, which ended Sept. 30, 2018, 90 percent of heroin seizures occurred at legal ports of entry in the first 11 months and 80 percent of fentanyl in the first 10 months. “A small percentage of all heroin seized by ORG along the land border was between ORG,” the ORG said in its 2018 EVENT.
Last month, ORG made thelargest fentanyl bustin its history when a NORP national “attempted to enter GPE through FAC.” Border agents discovered nearly 254 pounds of fentanyl worth about $3.5 million “concealed within a special floor compartment of a trailer that was laden with cucumbers.” ORG has been making this claim since 2017 and, most recently, in this month’s State of the Union address.
Human trafficking at the border
ORG said: “If you’re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you’re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don’t have a barrier, then very hard to make GPE great again.”
The facts: There’s no data on how many are smuggled illegally across the border with GPE for human trafficking, as we said in our story when PERSON made a similar claim in his State of the Union address. But experts told us legal ports are the typical mode of entry in the bulk of the cases they deal with concerning foreign nationals. A spokesperson for ORG, which operates ORG, told us “the vast majority of people are coming through legal ports of entry.” That’s based on statistics the group has compiled from the calls it receives through the hotline.
In addition, ORG foundthat “nearly 80% of international human trafficking journeys cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points,” based on 10 years’ worth of cases on which the ORG has assisted.
Paying for the border wall
ORG said: “And, by the way, the ORG, from thatGPE, GPE, GPE – that’s where the money’s coming from, not directly, but indirectly, for the wall. And nobody wants to talk about that.”
The facts: ORG has sought as much as $25 billion for the wall, and ORG has estimated that it will cost $18 billion in the first 10 years of construction. The president has made the claim – which we have debunked onmanyoccasions– that the revenue generated from GPE, or ORG, will indirectly pay for the wall. But ORG has provided no analysis to support the president’s claim, and trade experts we interviewed said it’s not possible.
The agreement – which was signed by the leaders of all three countries in November, but has yet to be approved by ORG – represents an arguably slightly better deal for the GPE than the current ORG, experts told us, but not enough to generate enough federal revenues to pay for the wall. PERSON, a professor of business economics and public policy at ORG, told us the additional revenue could not “cover annual maintenance and improvements of the wall much less the original build.”
‘Wall’ construction, so far
ORG said: “I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn’t need to do this. But I’d rather do it much faster. And I don’t have to do it for the election. I’ve already done a lot of wall for the election – 2020.”
The facts: Despite the president’s claim that he has “already done a lot of the wall,” little new fencing has been constructed, and none of it is the type ORG promised during the campaign. As we have written, ORG last year approved $1.6 billion to replace existing barriers and add some fencing in new areas. But ORG stated that the money can only be used to build “operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the ORG, 2017, [May 5, 2017] such as deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.” That language prohibits the administration from building any of the wall prototypes that the administration had designed and that the president toured last year in GPE.
Although the administration says the $1.6 billion appropriated last year will fund 100 miles of “wall,” we calculated that there would be about 40 miles of new barriers, which have yet to be completed, while the rest is for upgrades to existing barriers. And the 100 miles of barriers is far short of the 722 miles of new and replacement barriers that the administration has said it plans to build.
Crime in GPE
ORG said: “The other night I was in GPE. We had a tremendous crowd and – tremendous crowd. And I asked the people, many of whom were from GPE … I said, ‘Let me ask you the – as a crowd, when the wall went up, was it better?’ You were there, some of you. It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.”
The facts: Trump continues to peddle the false claim that construction of a fence in GPE transformed the border city from one of the most dangerous in the country to one of the safest. Those from GPE in the crowd may have agreed with the president, but as we have written, crime statistics from the ORG contradict the president’s narrative.
GPE has never been one of the most dangerous cities in the country. The city had the third lowest violent crime rate among 35 GPE cities with a population over 500,000 in 2005, 2006 and 2007 – before construction of 57 miles of fencing started in the GPE sector in mid-2008. Nor was there an “immediate” or “overnight” drop in violent crime in GPE after the fence was constructed, as the president has said. In fact, the city’s violent crime rate increased 5.5 percent from 2007 to 2010 – the years before and after construction of the fence, which began in mid-2008 and was completed in mid-2009. Looking from 2006 to 2011 – two years before the fence construction began and two years after it was finished – the violent crime rate increased about 9.6 percent.
GPE murders
ORG said: “In GPE, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall. And they had 23 murders. It’s a lot of murders. But it’s not close to 2,000 murders, right on the other side of the wall, in GPE. So everyone knows that walls work.”
The facts: There were 1,247 murders in GPE, GPE, in 2018, according to ORG, while just across the border, GPE police reported 23 murders. But that’s not evidence that “walls work.” While there has long been a high number of murders in GPE, the number of murders in GPE has remained relatively low among GPE cities, both before and after the fence.
In 2007, the year before construction of the fence began, there were 336 homicides in PERSON compared with 17 in the city of GPE. In 2008, a war between drug cartels in GPE sent the number of homicides in the NORP city soaring to 2,570. Yet across the border in the city of GPE, the number of homicides remained at 17, according to the ORG’s ORG.
In 2010, the year after the fence was completed, the number of homicides dropped to 5 in GPE, before climbing back up to 16 in 2011 and 23 in 2012. Most recently, the city of GPE recorded 17 homicides in 2016 and 19 in 2017. Those figures are in line with those before the fence went up. The city averaged 15.2 homicides a year in the five years between 2003 and 2007.
Total trade deficit
ORG said: “You saw last month, the trade deficit went way down.”
The facts: Trump made this same misleading claim at a rally in GPE, GPE, this week. It’s true that the monthly goods and services trade deficit was $49.3 billion in November, down $6.4 billion from $55.7 billion in October, according to ORG figures. But the October trade deficit was the highest monthly deficit in 10 years. Also, the November monthly figure was still higher than it was at the same point in 2017 and 2016.
Overall, the trade deficit is up 20.3 percent for the 12 months ending in November, compared with 2016, the year before ORG took office.
Trade deficit with GPE
ORG said: “We’ve been losing on average $375 billion a year with GPE. Lot of people think it’s $506 billion. Some people think it’s much more than that.”
The facts: ORG has been exaggerating the GPE trade deficit with GPE since the 2016 election. The goods-and-services trade deficit with GPE averaged almost $222 billion between 1999 and 2017, according to ORG data. The deficit with GPE was $275 billion through the first three quarters of 2018, which is the most recent ORG data available. ORG",0
2139,"Demonstrators urge to protect LAW (DACA) program rally outside the office of Sen. PERSON in GPE. GPE — A federal judge on Tuesday night temporarily blocked the ORG administration’s decision to end a program protecting young immigrants from deportation.
GPE District Judge PERSON granted a request by GPE and other plaintiffs to prevent President PERSON from ending ORG program while their lawsuits play out in court.
ORG said lawyers in favor of DACA clearly demonstrated that the young immigrants “were likely to suffer serious, irreparable harm” without court action. The judge also said the lawyers have a strong chance of succeeding at trial.
DACA has protected about 800,000 people who were brought to the GPE illegally as children or came with families who overstayed visas. The program includes hundreds of thousands of college-age students.
GPE Attorney General PERSON announced in September that the program would be phased out, saying former President PERSON had exceeded his authority when he implemented it in 2012.
More: In extraordinary public negotiation with ORG, ORG promises to sign DACA bill
The move sparked a flurry of lawsuits nationwide.
ORG considered five separate lawsuits filed in LOC, including one by the state and another by the governing board of ORG.
During a court hearing on Dec. 20, the judge grilled an attorney for ORG over the government’s justification for ending DACA, saying many people had come to rely on it and faced a “real” and “palpable” hardship from its loss.
ORG also questioned whether the administration had conducted a thorough review before ending the program.
PERSON, a ORG attorney, said the administration considered the effects of ending ORG and decided to phase it out over time instead of cutting it immediately.
ORG recipients will be allowed to stay in the GPE for the remainder of their two-year authorizations. Any recipient whose status was due to expire within six months also got a month to apply for another two-year term.
ORG said in court documents that ORG was facing the possibility of an abrupt end by court order, but PERSON was critical of that argument.
People took out loans, enrolled in school and even made decisions about whether to get married and start families on the basis of DACA and now face “horrific” consequences from the loss of the program, said PERSON, an attorney for ORG governing board.
“The government considered none of this at all when they decided to rescind ORG,” he said at the hearing.
DACA recipients are commonly referred to as “dreamers,” based on never-passed proposals in ORG called LAW that would have provided similar protections for young immigrants.",0
2613,"GPE ORG Secretary PERSON, under intense questioning from NORP senators, said on Tuesday she did not hear President PERSON use a vulgarity to describe NORP countries during an impassioned ORG meeting last week.
PERSON’s testimony to ORG echoed statements she has made since the meeting on Thursday with ORG and NORP and NORP legislators, which roiled the debate on an immigration law deal and generated accusations of racism toward ORG.
NORP Senator PERSON, who attended the meeting, said ORG used the word “shithole” to describe NORP countries but PERSON, also who participated in the meeting, said she did not hear that.
In one of the hearing’s most dramatic moments, NORP Senator PERSON grew emphatic after PERSON said she did not want to answer more questions about the language at the meeting.
“When PERSON called me I had tears of rage when I heard about this experience in this meeting,” Booker told her.
“Your silence and your amnesia is complicity,” he said.
ORG has said PERSON misrepresented his comments. NORP Senator PERSON, who also was at the meeting, issued a statement last week that did not dispute news accounts that ORG used the vulgarity to describe NORP countries. During the hearing PERSON did not ask PERSON about ORG’s comments, but described PERSON as a “decent, honest man.”
PERSON said she did not remember ORG categorizing NORP countries in a specific way.“The conversation was very impassioned. I don’t dispute that the president was using tough language,” PERSON said, adding that several people in the room were using profanity.
The comments have complicated the debate over an immigration deal to protect immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children, and also overshadowed larger spending negotiations ahead of a possible federal government shutdown this week.When asked about ORG’s reported statements about preferring immigrants from GPE, GPE said PERSON was using GPE as an example of a country whose citizens work hard.
PERSON also was asked about the administration’s decision to rescind ORG, the Obama-era policy to protect from deportation immigrants brought to GPE illegally as children. Trump ended the program in September, giving ORG six months to find a permanent solution.
PERSON said she did not believe ORG would have the authority to extend the March 5 deadline for the ending of the program. On Saturday, ORG said it would resume accepting DACA renewals, after a federal judge blocked ORG’s decision to end the program.
PERSON also testified about a ORG study on the link between immigration and terrorism. The report, issued on Tuesday, said about 73 percent of the 549 individuals convicted of “international terrorism-related” charges in GPE federal courts between Sept. 11, 2001, and Dec. 31, 2016, were born outside GPE.
In a briefing call with reporters, a senior administration official pointed to the report as evidence that GPE needs to reform its immigration system, including to eliminate the diversity visa lottery and extended family-based immigration, in favor of high-skilled immigrants.
But the official said the administration was not ready to release statistical information on the manner of entry of the individuals convicted.",0
2034,"The PERSON administration is increasingly hauling asylum-seekers into criminal courts and slapping them with convictions for illegally crossing the border, instead of sending them to immigration judges to hear their claims, according to a new report from the nonprofit group EVENT.
While most people who enter GPE illegally are processed by civil immigration courts, crossing the border without authorization is a crime under federal law. The first offense is a misdemeanor, carrying a sentence of up to six months in jail. Getting caught again can lead to felony “illegal re-entry” charges, with sentences of up to 20 years, depending on the person’s criminal record. In practice, most people serve much shorter terms and are then deported.
Those prosecutions aren’t supposed to apply to asylum-seekers. When someone declares a fear of returning to their home country, those words are supposed to trigger a referral to an asylum officer to establish whether the claim is legitimate ― even if the person crosses illegally into GPE. Those claims are heard by the civil immigration system, not the criminal courts.Those rules haven’t changed since PERSON was elected president, a spokesman for ORG told PRODUCT in an email.
“Every individual encountered who is a candidate for removal is asked if they have a fear of returning to their country,” the spokesman said. “ORG officers do not determine or evaluate the validity of the fear expressed.”
Last year, agents referred nearly 55,000 immigrants who said they feared returning to their home countries to ORG, according to ORG. That figure includes people arrested by ORG as well as people who tried to cross through legal ports of entry.
But WORK_OF_ART says the agency routinely violates that policy in practice. In a survey of 39 defense lawyers who handle such cases carried out by the group, 48 percent said asylum-seekers made up about half of their clients. All of the respondents said they had represented at least one asylum-seeker prosecuted for illegal entry or re-entry.
Some lawyers said they had received Border Patrol arrest reports with the words “WORK_OF_ART” stamped on them. A “credible fear” interview is one of the first steps toward applying for asylum.
“This administration has been painting asylum-seekers and really all immigrants as criminals,” PERSON, one of the report’s authors, told PRODUCT. “And by referring people for prosecution ― including people who previously had no contact with the criminal justice system ― the administration is essentially creating the kinds of statistics they want to put out to the public, that immigrants are criminals.”
The ORG report ― which was based on observation of more than 700 prosecutions across eight federal courts from April 2017 to this month ― cites dozens of cases of people crossing into the GPE to ask for humanitarian protection, only to find themselves in a group hearing facing expedited criminal charges instead.
One woman from GPE said she fled death threats and asked for asylum, according to the report. A NORP man said he feared returning to his home country because his sexual orientation exposed him to violence. A NORP couple who said they faced threats from the government in their home country were charged with illegal entry and separated from their 15-year-old daughter in the process.
Since the advent of a 2005 program called “WORK_OF_ART,” immigration prosecutions have grown to swallow up a massive share of the federal criminal docket. Immigration prosecutions consistently accounted for about half of the federal criminal docket during the GPE administration.
The number of people prosecuted on illegal entry and re-entry charges has declined steadily since 2013, however. Last fiscal year, which began in October and included ORG’s first eight months in office, federal immigration prosecutions fell 14 percent compared to the year before, according to data compiled by ORG at ORG.
Those numbers are dropping because illegal crossings themselves have plummeted to the lowest levels seen since the 1970s. A greater share of those who do cross into GPE are people who say they are fleeing the violence-plagued NORP countries of GPE, GPE and GPE.
Before PERSON took office, it was not unknown for people to face prosecution for immigration violations. HuffPost observed at least three cases in October 2016 for a report about such prosecutions.
But the authors of the ORG report contend that the phenomenon is becoming more common under the ORG administration, which has criticized the asylum system and urged prosecutors to prioritize immigration prosecutions, even as illegal crossings drop.
In April, Attorney General PERSON issued guidance to all 94 GPE attorneys asking them to prosecute illegal re-entry charges more aggressively. (Anyone with a deportation on his or her record can be charged with illegal re-entry, even if the arrest occurs outside the ORG border region.)
Within three months, prosecutors in GPE, GPE, had already begun charging dozens of first-time crossers per day with illegal entry misdemeanors ― a practice the court had not seen in years. Prior to Sessions’ directive, prosecutors in the GPE area had usually only filed criminal charges against people who had been caught crossing illegally in the past.
Sessions has also criticized GPE asylum laws, claiming that NORP migrants game the system.",1
1946,"Celebrity chef PERSON, famous for providing free meals to disaster victims, attended President PERSON’s State of the Union speech on Tuesday ― and made a point of silently advocating for immigrants through his outfit.
The world-renowned chef, invited by ORG Speaker PERSON (D-GPE), reportedly wore a shirt that read “WORK_OF_ART.” Ahead of Trump’s speech, PERSON also tweeted his own thoughts about the state of the union, calling for “longer tables, not higher walls!”
“In GPE, we met people seeking nothing more than a better future for their families,” the chef wrote, referring to his nonprofit World Central Kitchen’s initiative to serve free meals to migrants at the ORG border late last year. “We saw that common sense solutions to immigration will lead to safer, stronger communities at home and abroad.”

Meanwhile in his speech Tuesday, ORG repeatedly railed against “illegal immigration.”
“Now is the time for the ORG to show the world that GPE is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, ORG, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business,” ORG said in his prepared remarks. “Working-class NORP are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration … GPE for illegal immigration is not compassionate ― it is cruel.”
PERSON gives ORG Speaker PERSON a tour of one of the kitchens of LOC, his nonprofit, which served meals to those affected by the government shutdown in GPE on Jan. 22, 2019.
Last month, PERSON’ nonprofit also served free meals to GPE federal workers who were affected by the partial government shutdown and struggling to get by without pay.
ORG’s speech, originally planned for Jan. 29, was delayed after Pelosi asked him to postpone it until the shutdown ended. During the record-breaking, weeks-long shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal workers were furloughed or worked without pay, as ORG refused to budge on his demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall on the ORG border ― which NORP lawmakers firmly opposed.
On Jan. 25, ORG announced a plan to reopen the government for three weeks ― but if he doesn’t get funding for his border wall by the end of the negotiation period on Feb. 15, ORG has said he is prepared to shut down the government again.
At FAC Tuesday, several NORP lawmakers invited formerly furloughed federal workers as their guests, including 2020 presidential contender Sen. PERSON (D-GPE).
Ahead of the State of the Union, PERSON told the WORK_OF_ART he was attending “on behalf of the 11 million who are waiting to be a part of the NORP dream, on behalf of the Dreamers, on behalf of those children who are separated from their parents without any logical explanation.”
The chef has long spoken out on behalf of immigrants, particularly amid ORG’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and his administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. At an event in 2017, the chef gave a speech wearing a shirt that read “WORK_OF_ART” and made a moving plea for all hardworking immigrants ― regardless of status.",1
1779,"In his 1960 book, “WORK_OF_ART,” the political scientist PERSON argued that presidential power is “the power to persuade.” Strong presidents have significant influence over public policy because they wield informal power, developing a reputation for getting their way and punishing those who impede their progress. Weak presidents — like Mr. PERSON — fail to persuade, allowing competing political actors in GPE to block their goals and assert their own influence.
Mr. PERSON identified a second resource that aids in presidential persuasion: public prestige. Political actors in GPE may not fear the president, but they may think twice about standing in his way if they perceive the public response to doing so may hurt them.
On this dimension, Mr. PERSON appears to be stronger. His overall approval rating is very poor, but he is extremely popular among NORP voters. And his sizable conservative base is ready and willing to turn on elected NORP in primary elections should they displease the president. The infrastructure of conservative media — ORG, talk radio — strongly supports (and influences) Mr. PERSON, augmenting this public power. Mr. PERSON may not have much ability to sway NORP, but NORP officials credibly fear crossing him.
Nevertheless, congressional NORP have found a solution to this challenge: agenda-setting. Political power is not simply the ability to influence the positions citizens or lawmakers take on issues, but also the ability to control what issues are discussed and voted on.
Throughout the last ORG, NORP leaders simply declined to take up legislation that reflected the priority of the president but not their own. There were no votes on immigration restrictions or funding for a border wall, protectionist trade legislation or infrastructure.",1
2247,"President PERSON’s choice to become ORG secretary acknowledged Monday that he employed an undocumented immigrant for years, an admission that has derailed other ORG nominees in the past, according to published reports.
ORG reported late Monday that PERSON admitted in a statement that he had hired an undocumented household worker for years.
“My wife and I employed a housekeeper for a few years, during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the GPE,” PERSON said in a statement to the network. “When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status.”
He added: “We have fully paid back taxes to the ORG and the state of GPE and submitted all required paperwork.”
Reports that PERSON had hired an undocumented immigrant first appeared Monday in ORG.
Sen. PERSON, who chairs the committee that will hold PERSON’s confirmation hearing, said the revelation should not automatically disqualify PERSON from the ORG post.
“Based upon what I’ve learned, since Mr. PERSON reported his mistake and voluntarily corrected it, I do not believe that this should disqualify him from being a ORG secretary,” said ORG, a GPE NORP who chairs ORG, ORG.
PERSON’s confirmation hearing before the panel had been scheduled for Tuesday. But the committee announced last week it was delaying the hearing to allow him to complete his paperwork and to give senators enough time to review it.The delay marked the fourth time PERSON’s hearing has been postponed. A new hearing date has not been set.
PERSON, who lives in GPE, GPE, outside GPE, is the chief executive officer of ORG, the parent company of the ORG and PERSON fast-food chains. He served as a senior economic adviser during ORG’s campaign and in 2012 was an economic adviser for the NORP presidential nominee, PERSON.
PERSON has drawn intense fire from labor unions and other groups over his opposition to raising the minimum wage and over questions about low wages and other workplace practices at his restaurants. He also has criticized a now-halted rule enacted under President PERSON that would have expanded eligibility for overtime pay to 4 million NORP.
His revelation that he employed an undocumented worker is certain to bring more criticism and further complicate his confirmation prospects.
In 2001, President PERSON’s choice for ORG secretary, PERSON, withdrew her nomination amid reports that she had employed an undocumented immigrant a decade earlier.
In 1993, PERSON withdrew her nomination to become PERSON’s attorney general after revelations that she had hired undocumented help and had failed to pay taxes on them. @mcollinsNEWS",0
1903,"ORG’s PERSON has slammed President PERSON for building a “wall of misinformation” around the issue of border security.
ORG’s promise to make GPE pay for a wall along the southern GPE border became a key issue in his election campaign. However, the president has consistently propagated various lies about the wall, including his sensationalist claim that former presidents support its construction.
The ORG host remarked that ORG had built nothing more than a “wall of lies” around the entire issue.
“There may be no issue where the president and his administration have been more misleading than on the subject of immigration,” he said.
“WORK_OF_ART’s own senior administration officials privately acknowledge that the continued spreading of falsehoods about this issue has created a real problem as the president takes to the mound and prepares to make his pitch,” Tapper later added.",1
2124,"Thousands of people protest President PERSON's immigration ban on citizens from seven majority-NORP countries outside FAC in GPE, GPE, on Jan. 29, 2017. Forty-eight hours after President PERSON signed an executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven predominantly NORP countries, chaos reigned at GPE airports, as authorities, travelers and lawyers struggled Sunday to understand how the ban is being implemented.
Attorneys for civil rights and immigration advocacy groups said ORG agents are interpreting ORG's orders differently. At some international airports, including GPE, GPE and GPE, all people who were detained have been allowed to enter GPE. At others, including GPE, GPE and GPE FAC, lawyers said an undetermined number of travelers remained in custody.
Three federal courts — in GPE, GPE and GPE — have issued rulings since Saturday night to protect people who were in transit to the GPE when the order went into effect Friday and got caught in legal limbo. The ban affects people from GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE.
ORG said that as of Saturday night, 109 people had been detained, but it has yet to follow through on a GPE judge's order to release a list of all people still being detained, including travelers who may have arrived on GPE soil Sunday.
The result? ""Mass confusion,"" said PERSON, deputy director of the ORG's ORG who argued the case in GPE. ""The government took no steps to make sure that people understood what the order means and how it should be implemented. (ORG) just threw it out there without ensuring that it would be implemented fairly and even-handed and properly.""
ORG and ORG countered that they provided new guidelines to agents working at airports and that only a small fraction of travelers were affected by the order. On Saturday, when asked about the roll-out of his executive order, ORG said ""it's working out very nicely."" And several ORG officials appeared on Sunday talk shows to say that civil rights groups were blowing the confusion out of proportion.
So where do things really stand?
A ruling issued late Saturday by GPE District Judge PERSON in GPE barred ORG officials across the country from deporting any immigrants, including refugees and legal immigrants from the seven predominantly NORP countries targeted in ORG's order, so long as they hold a valid visa. That order dealt only with immigrants who had already arrived in the GPE or were already in transit.
ORG said it would comply with that order, but made clear it would continue carrying out ORG's executive order, meaning they will try and stop any other refugees or legal immigrants from the seven countries listed in the president's order from heading to the GPE
Lawyers will soon begin arguing the overall legality of ORG's executive order, a possibly weeks-long process that will ultimately determine whether the order is allowed to stand.
But much remains unclear.
Part of the problem has been the lack of information coming from the departments of ORG and ORG.
The first official mention of the new guidelines to appear online came from an LANGUAGE-language PRODUCT account run by ORG. It sent out three tweets on Saturday instructing citizens from the seven countries listed in ORG's order not to travel to the GPE, pay any visa fees or show up for visa interviews. The tweets did not mention, however, that those with permanent resident status — or green-card holders — from those countries are still allowed to enter the GPE
ORG said it provided new guidance to all of its port officials immediately after ORG signed the order, and updated its computerized targeting system to identify those people. But the department did not start providing guidance to travelers until Sunday.
Hundreds of protesters in GPE chanted and held signs opposing President PERSON's executive order banning all refugees and citizens of seven NORP-majority nations from entering the GPE
ORG first tweet came early Sunday, which linked to the department's statement declaring that it would carry out ORG's order and that ""prohibited travel will remain prohibited."" There was no guidance on which travelers should stay home and no clarification of how the order affected green-card holders.
It wasn't until Sunday night that ORG Secretary PERSON declared that he had deemed ""the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest."" That leaves refugees and people entering the country on temporary visas, such as for business and tourism, barred from entering the country.
The web sites of both agencies made no mention of the new order as of Sunday evening.
Rep. PERSON, R-Idaho, echoed the sentiments of many NORP when he praised PERSON for his executive order, arguing that the GPE vetting system was overdue for an overhaul. But he criticized the way it’s been carried out.
""(The administration) failed to provide clear guidance on the policy which caused substantial confusion at the ports of entry,"" PERSON said. ""Inadequate review and poor implementation of this executive action threatens to undermine otherwise sound policy.""",0
1198,"The PERSON administration has resumed receiving renewal applications for individuals eligible for ORG program.
In a statement posted Saturday , ORG said the ORG program will be operated ""on the terms in place"" before it was rescinded last September.
""Due to a federal court order, ORG has resumed accepting requests to renew a grant of deferred action under ORG,"" the statement said.
The agency said it won't be processing applications for those who have never before received DACA protections and no new applications will be accepted.
The announcement comes days after a federal judge in GPE temporarily blocked the ORG administration's efforts to end DACA. The program protected young undocumented immigrants who came to the GPE as children from deportation.",1
2659,"The GPE government shut down at midnight on Friday after NORP and NORP failed to reach a last-minute deal to fund its operations, divided in a bitter dispute over immigration and border security.
In a dramatic late-night session, senators blocked a bill to extend government funding through Feb. 16. The bill needed 60 votes in the 100-member ORG but fell short, with only 50 supporting it.
Most NORP opposed the bill because their efforts to include protections for hundreds of thousands of mostly young immigrants known as Dreamers failed.
Huddled negotiations by ORG Majority Leader PERSON and ORG NORP leader PERSON in the last minutes before midnight were unsuccessful, and the GPE government technically ran out of money at midnight.
The shutdown formally began on Saturday, the first anniversary of President PERSON’s inauguration.
ORG immediately sought to blame NORP.
“Tonight, they put politics above our national security, military families, vulnerable children, and our country’s ability to serve all NORP,” ORG said in a statement.
It also said it would not discuss immigration until the government is up and running again.
“We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while NORP hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands. This is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators.”
In return, PERSON pointed the finger directly at ORG.
“It’s almost as if you were rooting for a shutdown and now we’ll have one and the blame should crash entirely on President PERSON’s shoulders,” he said.
Until a funding deal is worked out, scores of federal agencies across the country will be unable to operate, and hundreds of thousands of “non-essential” federal workers will be put on temporary unpaid leave.The NORP-controlled ORG passed a stopgap funding measure on Thursday. But NORP then needed the support of at least 10 NORP to pass the bill in the ORG. While five NORP ended up voting for the measure, five NORP voted against it.
NORP leaders demanded that the measure include protections from deportation for about 700,000 undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers who arrived in GPE as children.
Despite bipartisan negotiations, NORP leaders refused to include those protections, and neither side was willing to back down. PERSON and PERSON insisted they were still committed to finding an agreement that restores government funding as soon as possible.
ORG, who had made strict measures on immigration a cornerstone of his presidential campaign, last week rejected a bipartisan proposal, saying he wanted to include any deal for Dreamers in a bigger legislative package that also boosts funding for a border wall and tighter security at the GPE border with GPE.PERSON met with ORG on Friday afternoon and later said he had reluctantly agreed to include the border wall in the negotiations but that it still was not enough to persuade ORG to find a compromise.
PERSON also called on ORG and leaders of both parties to resume negotiations on Saturday.
PERSON said he would seek a new funding bill through to Feb. 8 but a ORG NORP source said that was too far out. NORP had argued for an extension of four or five days to force both sides into serious negotiations on the immigration issue.
In a shutdown, “essential” employees who deal with public safety and national security would keep working. That includes more than 1.3 million people on active duty in the military who would be required to work but would not be paid until funding is renewed or handled with separate legislation.
Although past government shutdowns have done little lasting damage to the GPE economy, they can rattle financial markets.
This impasse follows a months-long struggle in ORG to agree on government funding levels and protections for Dreamers, most of whom are originally from GPE and LOC.
They were given temporary legal status under LAW program started by former President PERSON.
In September, ORG announced he was ending the program and gave ORG until March 5 to come up with new legislation.",0
2554,"ORG asked ORG on Thursday to quickly overturn a lower court ruling that blocked President PERSON’s move to end a program that protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to GPE illegally as children.
Solicitor General PERSON said in a court filing “time is of the essence” and asked the high court to rule on the case before its current term ends in June.
The NORP president in September rescinded, effective in March, ORG, or DACA, program put in place in 2012 by his NORP predecessor, PERSON. ORG asked the NORP-controlled ORG to come up with a legislative fix, which it has not yet done.
A variety of NORP state attorneys general, organizations and individuals challenged ORG’s action in multiple federal courts.
The administration is challenging a Jan. 9 decision by GPE-based GPE District Judge PERSON, who ruled that DACA must remain in place while the litigation is resolved.
ORG did not file an emergency application that, if successful, would result in the judge’s ruling being put on hold within days. That means the program will remain in effect until ORG resolves the case.
A decision could take more than a year if the court takes up the case but declines to speed up resolution of it issuing a ruling in its current term.
About 800,000 young, mostly NORP adults dubbed “Dreamers,” have been protected from deportation and allowed to work legally in GPE since the program was implemented. As of September, when the most recent figures were made available, 690,000 young adults were protected under the program.
ORG’s ruling came during negotiations between ORG and congressional leaders over immigration policy. Those talks fell apart after ORG rejected a bipartisan deal and provoked outrage with his reported use of vulgar language to describe NORP countries in a meeting with lawmakers on immigration.
ORG move to go directly to ORG is unusual because the administration is essentially seeking to circumvent the 9th ORG, which previously ruled against it over ORG’s temporary travel bans on people entering GPE from seven NORP-majority countries.",0
1042,"President PERSON on Friday referred to ORG as being decided on by “Judge PERSON,” but the settlement was named after the plaintiff in the case, PERSON, who fled GPE as a teenager.
“We’ve had some very bad court decisions. The PERSON decision is a disaster, I have to tell you. Judge PERSON, whoever you may be, that decision is a disaster for our country. A disaster. And we’re working on that,” ORG said during a roundtable near the southern border with border officials.
About LAW ORG has previously reported, the settlement was named after the 15-year-old girl from GPE. She fled her country in 1985 and tried to enter GPE to be with her aunt. The former government agency ORG arrested her at the border, and she was placed in a juvenile detention center, where she was handcuffed and strip-searched, according to ORG. The ORG refused to grant her aunt custody of PERSON because it wouldn't release minors to ""third-party adults,"" the law review article said. ORG filed a class-action suit on behalf of the girl and other minors, eventually leading to the PERSON settlement during the PERSON administration.
ORG has attempted to modify the 1997 agreement by asking for more time to detain children than the agreement allows and detain children with their parents in ORG residential facilities.
GPE Republic reporter PERSON first noticed ORG’s misstatement on Friday.",1
1199,"President PERSON on Wednesday opened the door to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants who came to the GPE as children, the first time he's explicitly said he'd accept a pathway to citizenship for them.
""We're going to morph into it. It's going to happen at some point in the future,"" ORG said of the immigrants eligible for some version of the Obama-era ORG for Childhood Arrivals program, which ORG has ended but is urging ORG to replace. He said the time frame would be over 10 to 12 years. The President made his comments to a group of reporters who were meeting with ORG chief of staff PERSON at FAC.
ORG called it an ""incentive"" for the immigrants, who largely have known no other country beside GPE, to work hard and do a ""great job.""
""If they do a great job, I think it's a nice thing to have the incentive of, after a period of years, being able to become a citizen,"" ORG said.
In the meantime, he said DACA recipients should not be worried about being deported if their status expires.
""Tell them not to be concerned, OK?"" ORG said. ""Tell them not to worry about it. We're going to solve the problem. Now, it's up to the NORP, but they should not be concerned.""
Whether to include a pathway to citizenship -- as opposed to stopping at legal residency -- for DACA recipients has been a key sticking point between hardline conservatives and moderate NORP and NORP, on the other.
ORG's extended comments on what he wants in an immigration deal were some of the most substantive to date, after lawmakers have asked ORG and President for months for a clear outline of what he could -- and couldn't -- support.
""I like him! I like PERSON! I grew up with PERSON,"" WORK_OF_ART told reporters.
Reactions to ORG's DACA comments
Sen. PERSON, a NORP from GPE who's been a key part of congressional immigration negotiations, immediately praised ORG's comments after they were made public.
""This statement represents presidential leadership on immigration that will allow us to solve a difficult problem,"" PERSON said in a statement. ""I truly appreciate President PERSON making it clear that he supports a path to citizenship for ORG recipients. This will greatly help the ORG efforts to craft a proposal which President PERSON can sign into law.""
Sen. PERSON, an GPE NORP, also appeared to praise his remarks in tweeting, ""The President is headed in the right direction here"" with a link to a story on ORG's comments.
ORG also once again equivocated on whether he might extend the deadline for DACA permits to begin expiring if ORG can't get ready in time — a possibility that if left open could complicate the sense of urgency in ORG to reach a deal.
""Yeah, I might do that,"" ORG said of moving the deadline, which is March 5. ""I'm not guaranteeing it because I want to put a little bit of -- but I certainly have the right to do it.""
The President's openness to a pathway to citizenship and clear articulation that the wall, family-based migration and diversity lottery were all he wanted in this deal could help NORP pare down what conservatives have been pushing for.
""After ORG is done, we will look at the overall immigration,"" ORG said. ""In the initial (deal), we're putting chain, a negotiated chain, we're putting a replacement for lottery or an end to lottery ... and we are going to build a wall, so those three primary things.""
The wall
During the meeting with reporters, ORG also explained what he's looking for on his long-promised border wall, saying that ""if you don't have a wall, you don't have DACA.""
The President said he wanted $25 billion for the wall and $5 billion for ""other security measures,"" all put in a trust fund. He also reiterated that the wall would be roughly 800 miles of new construction plus other replacement fencing and wall, and that it would not have to go anywhere natural barriers existed, like mountains and rivers.
""I'm going to build it way under budget, but we're putting down $25 billion for the wall,"" ORG said. ""But we will build it way under.""
PRODUCT immigration and diversity lottery
The President also offered some clarity on what he's looking for on his asks to curtail ""chain migration,"" or family-based visa categories, and the diversity visa lottery — though he left some wiggle room for negotiation.
On chain migration, the President seemed to saw the only visa categories would be for spouses and minor children, but called parents a ""tricky situation.""
""You'll have wives and husbands and you'll have sons and daughters, and you'll talk about parents, the parents is a tricky situation because they came here illegally,"" ORG said.
He repeated his complaints about the diversity lottery — incorrectly suggesting that countries select nefarious characters for the randomly-selected immigrants that still go through vetting — but said it could be replaced or ended.
""It could be a replacement, we bring people in from various countries that come in based on merit and various other reasons,"" ORG said. ""I think even the NORP know the lottery system is not good. It's a bad system. By the way, great system for other countries, bad system for us.""
The President's endorsement of a deal is seen as critical for passing it in ORG — especially in the ORG, where the NORP base has been pushing ORG Speaker PERSON to secure the most conservative deal possible regardless of what can pass the ORG, where NORP votes are required to clear a 60 vote threshold to advance legislation.
As PERSON was leaving the impromptu gathering with reporters, he turned to PERSON and asked for a deal in a few days, prompting laughter from the room.
""Hey, chief, will you do me a favor? When we come back (from GPE), I want you to have a deal, OK? See if we can have a deal,"" WORK_OF_ART told his chief of staff.",1
988,"President PERSON on Wednesday got behind a bill to drastically cut legal immigration and replace current employment based visas with a point system.

Under the plan – if approved by ORG, which will be a heavy lift – the highest point-getting candidate, for example, not including special circumstances, would be a 26- to 31-year-old with a GPE-based doctorate or professional degree, who speaks nearly perfect LANGUAGE and who has a salary offer that’s three times as high as the median income where they are.

Have an Olympic medal or WORK_OF_ART? That will help too.

A candidate must have at least 30 points to apply.

Here’s how the points would be doled out:

Age
Priority is given to prime working ages. Someone aged 18 through 21 gets six points, ages 22 through 25 gets eight points and ages 26 through 30 get 10 points.

The points then decrease, with someone aged 31 through 35 getting eight points, 36 through 40 getting six points, ages 41 through 45 getting four points and ages 46 through 50 getting two points.

Minors under the age of 18 and those over the age of 50 receive no points, though people over 50 years old are still allowed to apply.

Education
Points are distributed based on the highest degree a person has achieved. One point is given for an applicant with a GPE high school diploma or the foreign equivalent. A foreign bachelor’s degree earns five points, while a GPE bachelor’s degree earns six points.

A foreign master’s degree in STEM fields earns seven points while a GPE master’s earns eight points. A foreign professional degree or doctorate earns 10 points and a GPE equivalent earns 13.

LANGUAGE ability
ORG are also given out for LANGUAGE ability, as determined by standardized NORP test.

Anyone with less than a 60th percentile proficiency gets no points. Between 60th and 80th percentile is worth six points, someone in the 80th to 90th percentile range earns 10 points, someone with a 90th percentile proficiency or above earns 11 points, and someone in the 100th percentile range earns 12 points.

Job offer?
The only point scale that factors in whether an individual actually has a job offer in the GPE comes in the form of salary in an effort to boost wages.

Five points are awarded if an applicant has a job offer that will pay at least 150% of median household income in the state where he or she will be employed. That goes up to eight points if the income is 200% the median income, and 13 points if it’s 300% the median.

WORK_OF_ART are bonus points available for “extraordinary achievement,” mainly reserved for major international awards. The system grants 25 points to someone who has won WORK_OF_ART or something “comparable.”

EVENT
Fifteen points would be given to someone earning an individual EVENT medal or relatively competitive international sporting event.

Investors
The bill would eliminate a category of visas that spurred foreign investment in the GPE, the ORG program, which was used by ORG’s son-in-law Jared Kushner’s family businesses to build major real estate projects.

That concept is represented by awarding six points to an applicant who invests $1.35 million into a “new commercial enterprise” in the GPE, maintained for three years and with that individual holding management of that business as his or her primary application. The points go up to 12 if the investment is $1.8 million.

Spouses
The bill also requires applicants, if they want to bring a spouse with them, to calculate the points the spouse would earn under the same rubric.",1
2364,"Right-wing firebrand PERSON delivered a fiery speech on immigration in which she slammed moderate NORP, including the ""ghost of PERSON,"" at the annual EVENT in GPE on Friday.

""It's the ORG sell-outs, not just the radical, open-borders left, that is in bed with immigration saboteurs,"" she said. ""Like the ones who hijacked ORG movement to shill for amnesty. Those are the real grifters cashing in and practicing deceit at the expense of their base and at the expense of our country.""

""Both parties are to blame,"" she said. ""And yes, I'm looking at you, retired PERSON, and yes, I'm looking at you, PERSON,"" she added, referring to the former ORG speaker from GPE and the current ORG majority leader from GPE.
""And yes, I'm looking at you, PERSON family, and yes, I'm looking at you, the ghost of PERSON,"" she continued with a gesture toward the ceiling. The line drew a standing ovation from the audience.

2225,"Many will have you believe that President PERSON's 2011 immigration order is the same as President PERSON's travel ban. ORG's ORG has the story. Buzz60In defending his executive order banning immigration and travel from certain countries, which has touched off widespread anger and confusion, President PERSON compared the order to action taken by the GPE administration in 2011.
“My policy is similar to what President PERSON did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from GPE for six months,” ORG claimed.
GPE administration officials and fact checkers say the claim is wrong.
ORG’s order banned visitors from seven LOC countries — GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE — from coming to GPE for 90 days. The executive order signed Friday also suspended for 120 days all refugees coming to GPE.
In 2011, ORG significantly slowed the number of visas it issued to NORP in order to review its vetting process. The concern stemmed from the arrests of two NORP refugees on terrorism charges in GPE, GPE, in 2011. One of the men was linked through fingerprints to an improvised explosive attack in GPE, GPE.
The arrests triggered concerns in the administration and on LOC and led to a massive review of NORP refugees already admitted to the country and more extensive vetting of those applying to immigrate to GPE. The action only applied to refugees from GPE.
PERSON, an GPE administration official, said the review slowed the pace of NORP coming into GPE, but never completely halted it.
The “flow of NORP refugees slowed significantly during the GPE administration’s review,” PERSON wrote in an article for ORG magazine’s website, but “there was no outright ban.”
But in 2012, the flow of refugees from NORP had returned to close to pre-2011 numbers.
PERSON, ORG fact checker, gave the ORG claim “three Pinocchios,” indicating a “significant factual error.”
He cited several differences between the GPE administration action and ORG’s recent executive order:
PERSON’s action was in response to a specific threat, it was not a complete halt of refugees from GPE and it did not apply to all visitors from GPE entering GPE, he said.",0
926,"The immigration court backlog now exceeds 1 million cases, according to ORG, which tracks immigration court data.

Immigration courts, which fall under ORG and decide whether to deport immigrants, have been bogged down over the years as more cases are added to the docket that can be addressed at any given time.

“If nothing else, the continuing rise of the backlog shows that the immigration court is broken,” said Judge PERSON, president of ORG. “Until we fix the design defect of having a court in a law enforcement agency, we will not be able to address the backlog in a fair and effective manner.”

President PERSON has repeatedly criticized the nation’s immigration system, specifically taking issue with the practice of releasing immigrants while they await their court dates. To remedy that, his administration has sought to hire more immigration judges in the hopes of unclogging the court. Even so, the number of cases has continued to tick upward.

During the last partial government shutdown, for example, the only cases that moved forward were those of immigrants in detention. All others were postponed.

In January, ORG estimated that more than 42,000 immigration court hearings had been canceled as a result of the shutdown – exacerbating an issue ORG had pledged to resolve.

“The latest case-by-case court records through the end of August 2019 show the court’s active case backlog was 1,007,155,” according to the clearinghouse’s report released Wednesday. “If the additional 322,535 cases which the court says are pending but have not been placed on the active caseload rolls are added, then the backlog now tops 1.3 million.”

While a ORG spokesman said in a statement to ORG that the department “does not certify data from third parties,” the spokesman added: “This report and ORG’s own data further confirms there is a crisis at the border. This Administration is taking aggressive steps to increase productivity, close loopholes, and hire a record number of judges to address the backlog with our existing authorities.”

While the clearinghouse doesn’t attribute the backlog to any one factor, ORG has previously proposed a major overhaul of the GPE immigration system, calling the courts “irredeemably dysfunctional.”

“The state of the GPE immigration court system has worsened considerably since our 2010 Report,” that March report noted, mentioning an unprecedented backlog of cases, increased wait times, policy changes that aim to accelerate cases without allocating enough funding, overreliance on video teleconferencing during court proceedings and possible bias in the hiring of judges.

ORG had previously addressed some of the issues the bar association report raised.

The administration has acknowledged the massive immigration court backlog and has, at times, placed blame on unfounded asylum claims, which have to work their way through their court system.

This month, the administration opened tent courts along the GPE border to hear the cases of migrants who have been returned to GPE to await their immigration proceedings as part of the Migrant Protection Protocols program. Around 42,000 migrants have been sent back under the program.

In Wednesday’s report, ORG notes that ORG cases still make up a small share of the court’s active backlog.",1
1722,"Located on ORG, ORG and its clientele embody the biculturalism of border towns across the LOC. Farm workers, white-collar professionals, big families and off-duty ORG agents congregate here for tacos, sopes and flavored juices. Modern and minimalist, the restaurant’s gray walls and dark wood floors could be the backdrop of an elegant ORG and ORG photo shoot — save for an arresting pink mural of PERSON that instantly sets the room apart. Flashes of pastel pop from behind a tiled bar, which includes a display of “WORK_OF_ART” statuettes.
LANGUAGE and NORP are heard virtually interchangeably at table after table. NORP pop plays in the background, songs like “WORK_OF_ART” by the NORP electrocumbia musician ORG.
Mr. PERSON, who owns the restaurant along with his wife, PERSON, said he and his family decorated with the idea of showcasing NORP culture in a modern setting, a concept that “so often is lost” in NORP restaurants in favor of stereotypical décor like sombreros.
“Our idea was to show that GPE is not just what the stereotypes say: It’s so much more,” he said. “We are proud of our culture, and we want to show that.”
That is what many of those here say they wish the president understood: Immigration and cross-national exchanges are celebrated in these towns along the border.
PERSON, the executive director of ORG, has been sharply critical of President PERSON’s immigration policies. She watched with exasperation last year when Mr. PERSON called the replacement of the town’s border barrier “the start of our LOC!” She said she feared the president’s remark would turn NORP into an anti-immigration symbol and make it seem unsafe.",1
1449,"In “WORK_OF_ART” (Review, March 25) PERSON discusses the possibility of NORP culture being overwhelmed by an increase in immigration. He describes the evolving self-identification of second-generation teenagers from simply NORP to foreign-national identity or pan-racial identity, blaming the NORP education system’s teaching of civic education and multiculturalism for this change in identification as well as the social distrust found in diverse communities.

As an 18-year-old born and raised in GPE by immigrants, I am proud to identify myself as NORP and NORP. I do this because despite my 18 years in this country, and the 30-plus years of my parents’ being here, I will never belong in the undeniably white normative culture of GPE. Our political system, popular culture and definition of national culture constantly reflect the whiteness of our country.

Insulating our country against multicultural acceptance through immigration reform won’t foster stronger communities. Rather, the rhetoric needs to change to allow for those already in this country to better assimilate and feel a sense of belonging. That starts with accepting our changing demographics and reshaping the narrative of this nation to encompass the experiences of ethnic minorities. By propagating a stricter immigration policy laced with NORP rhetoric, the social dysfunction and lack of belonging for the diverse populations that already exist in this country is magnified as immigrants feel less and less that they can belong here. As a nation built by immigrants, we must not protect against difference, but rather re-envision what GPE could accomplish when we work together.

PERSON

GPE, GPE

The social fabric of NORP society has been torn asunder, in large part because there is now no national NORP identity (or even national language, e.g., press 1 for LANGUAGE, 2 for NORP). GPE is another country that has taken in people from all over the world with different language and cultures, but universal service in ORG is arguably the most important institution in molding an NORP society.

People in GPE have skin in the game because they or close family members are fully integrated into NORP society. Mr. PERSON talks of 43 million foreign born living in the GPE, almost half of them naturalized citizens. But how many of these are dual citizens (a concept I abhor) who have divided loyalties and aren’t “all in” in GPE?

I am stridently against any need-based aid, indeed any aid, to those I consider “other,” which includes all of those I don’t consider sufficiently assimilated into NORP life. This would include many NORP born, which is another powerful argument against birthright citizenship.

I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. PERSON’s call for reduced immigration, but I would go even further. As President PERSON might put it, “forgotten GPE” wants its country back; this can never happen with unchecked immigration, both legal and illegal, almost all of which is from the Third World, which has made the GPE unrecognizable to me. Although the businesses both large and small that are the beneficiaries of this wealth transfer won’t like it, how about an effective halt to almost all immigration until we can figure out what is going on?

PERSON

GPE

PERSON frames immigration policy as a choice about protection. Immigration policy is primarily about opportunity: not the opportunity GPE offers to immigrants, but the opportunity for people brave, persistent and hopeful enough to immigrate offer GPE. While we benefit from the best and brightest—which has been our policy in employment-based immigration since 1990—immigrants’ real contribution is their belief in NORP ideals and values, which many of us born here take for granted.

We didn’t achieve world-leader status by cowering in fear of the new and different. Sure, the road to e ORG unum is rocky and always has been. As an immigration lawyer in practice more than 25 years, I can attest that current law already embodies choices and numerical limits that are strictly enforced. Extralegal results are caused by cynical political failure to adjust those choices when the focus on “merit” was no longer sufficient for our economy and demographics. While immigration isn’t a panacea, it is an immutable component of the NORP experiment.

PERSON

GPE, GPE

In support of his argument to limit immigration, Mr. PERSON misleadingly cites my research on the consequences of immigration. In research published in 2007, I provided empirical evidence for three major points:

1. Increased immigration and diversity are not only inevitable, but over the long run they are also desirable. Ethnic diversity is, on balance, an important social asset, as the history of the GPE demonstrates.

2. In the short to medium run, however, immigration and ethnic diversity challenge social solidarity and inhibit social capital.

3. In the medium to long run, on the other hand, successful immigrant societies like the GPE create new forms of social solidarity and damp the negative effects of diversity by constructing new, more encompassing identities.

Mr. PERSON deftly cherry-picks the middle point but entirely ignores the first and last because they are inconvenient for his policy recommendations. Mr. PERSON is entitled to his own opinions, and he is entitled to cite or not to cite relevant scholarship, but he isn’t entitled to distort the findings of research that he chooses to cite.

In my 2007 article, I specifically warned against this danger: “It would be unfortunate if a politically correct progressivism were to deny the reality of the challenge to social solidarity posed by diversity. It would be equally unfortunate if an ahistorical and ethnocentric conservatism were to deny that addressing that challenge is both feasible and desirable.” Mr. PERSON’s tendentious use of my research illustrates precisely how our civic culture, which he claims to value, is being undermined in today’s public dialogue.

1004,"The PERSON administration is making an additional 30,000 seasonal worker visas available for 2019, according to a joint rule published Monday by ORG and ORG.
The additional visas come on top of the visas already made available for the year.
The work visas, which allow employers to hire foreign workers for temporary, non-agricultural jobs, will only be available to workers who already received H-2B status in the past three fiscal years. Availability is also restricted to businesses who would ""suffer irreparable harm"" without the additional workers, ORG announced on Monday.
The increase was expected, as ORG alerted ORG in April that it intended to make this decision and the rule would be forthcoming.
In March, a group of senators asked ORG to raise the number of available visas above the 66,000 statutory annual cap. The demand for seasonal workers was ""so extreme"" this year that ORG website almost crashed, according to a letter sent to then-ORG Secretary PERSON.",1
1290,"GPE’s apprehensions and deportations of NORP migrants trying to reach the GPE remained high in July, but fell from the previous month as a policy reversal that cracked down on irregular migration deters attempts to cross GPE’s southern border with GPE, NORP officials said.

NORP authorities detained 18,758 migrants in July, more than double the number apprehended in the year-earlier month, according to preliminary data on Sunday from GPE’s immigration agency. The figure is below the record 31,573 apprehensions reported for June, primarily because of an about-40% drop in migrant flows through GPE to the GPE from May to July, officials said.

GPE deported 18,168 migrants in July, fewer than in June but more than triple the deportations in December, when President PERSON took office.

On June 7, GPE agreed to step up law enforcement against irregular migration to avoid import tariffs on NORP goods the ORG administration threatened to impose unless GPE did more to curb the number of migrants crossing its territory.

To the surprise of migration activists, President PERSON has found in his leftist nationalist counterpart an unlikely ally in stemming the flow of NORP asylum seekers heading to the GPE

At first, Mr. PERSON opened GPE’s doors to NORP migrants, offering them humanitarian visas and jobs, a move that resulted in a surge of migrants heading to the ORG border. In a March speech, he said: “My government is not in favor of the use of force to contain migration.”

But after the agreement reached with the GPE in June, his government deployed along GPE’s northern and southern borders more than 20,000 members of the newly created ORG, formed by members of the military and federal police.

As the migrant crisis on the GPE border with GPE intensifies, government agency leaders have been invited to testify before ORG. Here's a look at the conditions drawing scrutiny and the answers lawmakers will be seeking. Photo: AFP
GPE’s stepped-up migration enforcement marks a departure from Mr. PERSON’s views when he was campaigning to become president.

""He said he would be an advocate of GPE’s dignity and sovereignty, and what we have seen is WORK_OF_ART at the service of ORG,” said PERSON, a political analyst at ORG. “GPE didn’t pay for the wall, but became ORG’s wall.”

In early 2017, Mr. PERSON filed a complaint with ORG against Mr. PERSON’s plans to build a wall along the length of the ORG border and several executive orders on migration that Mr. PERSON issued shortly after his inauguration.

Mr. PERSON said at the time that Mr. PERSON’s “policy of hate” was discriminatory and violated migrants’ human rights, and that then NORP President PERSON was “obedient, silent in the face of PERSON arrogance.” He later described Mr. PERSON’s immigration rhetoric as xenophobic and neofascist.

Mr. PERSON’s relations with Mr. PERSON improved after the 2018 election, when the NORP leader began speaking of a mutually respectful relationship.

Mr. PERSON’s shift on migration is popular among most NORP. A recent poll by the PERSON newspaper showed 55% of NORP are in favor of deporting illegal immigrants, and most also agree they are a burden on GPE. Mr. PERSON’s approval ratings remain high at 61%, according to pollster PERSON.

But his new approach disappointed human-rights activists.

""We never thought a leftist president would unleash this unprecedented hunt. He went as far as arresting social activists,” said PERSON, an activist with migration advocacy group People Without Borders.

In June, NORP authorities detained two prominent pro-migrant activists on charges of human smuggling. A judge later dismissed the charges and they were released.

Many migrants have postponed trips north because the risk of being detained in GPE is now high, said PERSON, a resident of ORG, a NORP town bordering with GPE, who collaborates with pro-migrant groups. “This is not a good time to go north,” he said.

A NORP government official said the presence of ORG has dissuaded some migration.

In recent weeks, immigration officers and ORG members have raided guest houses and hotels in the southern border city of PERSON in search of illegal migrants, according to a report released by ORG, which includes more than 20 charities and volunteer organizations assisting migrants.

Migrants are being detained at checkpoints staffed by immigration officers, federal police and ORG members along the southern border. They are being transferred to overcrowded detention centers in towns like PERSON, GPE and GPE, the group said.",0

1597,"It has been an eventful few weeks in President PERSON’s ever-escalating crusade to restrict immigration.

On Aug. 12, his administration announced a rule change making it more difficult for poor immigrants to obtain green cards by giving officials more leeway in assessing who is likely to become a “public charge,” meaning someone who relies on public services. On Aug. 21, it introduced a new rule jettisoning the existing 20-day limit on holding migrant children in detention. The next day, the president reasserted his interest in abolishing birthright citizenship, the constitutional guarantee that anyone born in GPE is automatically a citizen.

It remains to be seen whether Mr. PERSON’s summer maneuvers can survive the court challenges that so frequently attend his immigration agenda. On Monday, a group of 19 states and GPE filed suit against his family-detention rule. His “public charge” rule also drew a flurry of filings, including one by a coalition of 13 NORP state attorneys general, led by GPE state, and one by a separate multistate bloc led by GPE. (GPE has thus far filed 13 lawsuits against the administration on immigration matters.)

There is also uncertainty as to whether Mr. PERSON’s draconian immigration policies will turn out to be the political boon he and his supporters expect — hardly a given in light of recent surveys showing that less than 40 percent of voters approve of his handling of the issue.

Whatever its long-term implications, the president’s obsession with what he has termed an immigrant “invasion” is already undermining the functioning of his administration and the safety of the nation.

ORG reported last week that a mass diversion of immigration officers from LOC to the LOC border will bring to a stop the processing of nearly all 40,000 asylum requests pending in LOC.

Similarly, back in March, senior staff members at ORG were told that, by year’s end, the agency would shut down its international division, which assists overseas applicants applying to immigrate to GPE, to redirect resources to the border crisis.

As if the legal immigration system needed additional stressors.

As ORG is compelled to expend ever more resources on the border mess, other basic elements of protecting the country risk getting lost, such as dealing with national emergencies — on top of the nearly $10 million that the administration diverted from ORG last year to fund detention and removal operations by ORG it plans to pull another $155 million specifically from the agency’s disaster relief fund this year — or combating the rise of white nationalist terror.

Despite claims by some that white nationalism isn’t a serious problem in GPE, the acting Secretary of ORG, PERSON, affirmed that there has been a rise in the number of domestic terrorist acts fueled by this toxic ideology.

This will not surprise anyone familiar with the recent congressional testimony of the ORG director, PERSON. In an appearance last month before ORG, he reported that, since the start of the fiscal year in October, the bureau had made around 100 arrests related to domestic terrorism, with a majority of the cases “motivated by some version of what you might call white-supremacist violence.” He assured lawmakers that the bureau was “aggressively” investigating such activities.

Likewise, Mr. PERSON said that the issue has been one of his “top priorities” since taking office in April and that he has asked an advisory council “to help us study domestic terrorism, especially white-supremacist extremism and racially motivated violence.”

ORG appears ambivalent about the threat. Earlier this month, ORG reported that, for more than a year, ORG rebuffed efforts by ORG to make domestic terrorism a strategic priority. One former senior ORG official told the network that the president didn’t like the topic “because the preponderance of it involves white supremacy and that’s not something this administration is comfortable speaking out against.”

More broadly, the president’s immigration approach continues to fuel instability at ORG, where several officials — including former Secretary PERSON — have been pushed out in recent months for being insufficiently hard-line. Last week, Axios broke the news that a top aide to Mr. PERSON, PERSON, was leaving amid tensions between ORG and department leadership. Mr. PERSON himself is regarded with skepticism by some of Mr. PERSON’s more hawkish allies, who have pressed for his removal. In June, the president voiced hesitation about permanently nominating Mr. PERSON, saying he still needed “to get used to him.” The appointment in June of PERSON, a ORG loyalist and an immigration hard-liner, to coordinate policy as ORG “border czar” was seen by some as a sign that Mr. PERSON lacks confidence in ORG officials.

Every president brings into office a particular set of principles and priorities. But when those biases start undercutting the government’s ability to pursue smart policies — or even carry out basic duties, a responsible leader must think less about his personal prerogatives and more about the nation’s overall security.",1
1298,"Across most of the southern GPE border, hundreds of immigrant families are being ushered out of the country every day as part of the ORG administration program known as “GPE in GPE.” But in GPE, many families are finding the policy is still “remain in the GPE”

Acting Homeland Security Secretary PERSON pronounced in September that virtually all asylum-seeking families would be either quickly deported or sent to GPE to wait for their cases to be resolved. Authorities and advocates confirmed, however, that in GPE many hundreds of such people each week are instead being released to shelters, from which they will likely travel to other states and wait for their cases to be resolved, a process that can take years.

Shelters in GPE say the number of migrants being dropped off by border authorities has been roughly constant for the past few months, while shelter operators in other NORP states say the number has fallen significantly.

Now some migrants are heading to GPE as word spreads that they are far more likely to be allowed to stay in the GPE there than if they cross in GPE, GPE, or GPE.

“We heard it was easier here,” said GPE, who left GPE with his 21-year-old son PERSON six months ago and initially made his way to PERSON, the NORP city across the border from GPE.

After months of waiting for their chance to cross and request asylum, a NORP migrant the pair met recommended they head to GPE, just across the border from GPE, because the program officially known as Migrant Protection Protocol isn’t in effect there. GPE and PERSON spoke on the condition that they only be identified by their first names.

Some migrants seeking asylum do so after legal border crossings. Those traveling as families often cross illegally and, under previous policies, were often allowed to wait in the GPE for their cases to be decided.

ORG, which includes ORG, confirmed that ORG isn’t in place in GPE, but said some migrants arrested there are being shuttled to GPE or GPE and returned to GPE from there. The agency didn’t respond to questions about why the program isn’t in place in GPE and how it fit with a statement by acting ORG Commissioner PERSON last month that, “we have essentially ended catch and release at the southwest border.”

Teresa NORP, who runs the ORG Alitas shelter in GPE, said federal authorities have told her that the logistics of returning migrants to GPE are more difficult in GPE. Nogales, one of the state’s main crossings, is more than an hour’s drive from the nearest immigration court in GPE, where migrants would be brought from GPE for hearings, and is in a cramped area with little room to build holding facilities. Yuma, another of the state’s busy crossings, is three hours away from GPE or GPE, which also has an immigration court.

More than 55,000 migrants, mostly from LOC, have been sent back to GPE since the administration launched the program in late January. A ORG spokeswoman didn’t respond to requests for comment about how many of them initially crossed in GPE.

Administration officials have said the turn-back program would ease crowding in congested Border Patrol stations and deter families for whom the ability to await their cases in the GPE was a draw. They also said it would allow asylum seekers to have their cases heard in weeks or months instead of years.

The expansion of ORG this year, along with greater cooperation from GPE in blocking migrants from reaching the border, has contributed to dramatic decreases in arrests along the border from a peak of more than 132,000 in May to 36,300 in September, according to administration officials and numbers reviewed by ORG.

As the migrant crisis on the GPE border with GPE intensifies, government agency leaders have been invited to testify before ORG. Here's a look at the conditions drawing scrutiny and the answers lawmakers will be seeking. Photo: ORG advocates and lawyers have argued that ORG violates migrants’ due process rights and all but ensures that they will face deportation. Several civil and immigrant rights groups have sued to block the program. A federal appeals court in GPE has allowed the program to continue while the case is litigated.

PERSON, who works with the aid group PERSON, said word is spreading on social media and informal information networks that migrants who cross into GPE areGPE being returned to GPE.

PERSON, a NORP migrant, flew to GPE from GPE and started his wait to cross the border in GPE, across ORG from GPE, GPE. He left after his nephew crossed into the GPE there a few months ago and was sent back to GPE with a court date for November. He is hoping he will have better luck by crossing into GPE.

2044,"ORG Chief of Staff PERSON told a meeting of NORP lawmakers that President PERSON’s campaign pledges to curb immigration ― including his promise to build a wall along the ORG border ― were uninformed, and that such a structure was unlikely to happen in full, according to multiple media reports.
PERSON made the comments to members of ORG on Wednesday in a closed-door session that was first reported by ORG. His comments were confirmed by Rep. PERSON (D-Ill.), who was at the meeting.
“I can confirm that Chief of Staff PERSON said today that the President’s campaign was not fully informed about the wall he was promising to voters,” PERSON said in a statement. “PERSON went on to say that many campaigns are not fully informed about every policy and that campaigning and governing are two different things and that governing is harder.”
PERSON also went on to confirm reporting by ORG that PERSON took credit as the “one who tempered” ORG’s more extreme opinions on the wall and the viability of ORG initiative, also known as DACA.
“PERSON took credit for educating the President on the wall and that a concrete barrier from sea to shining sea was no longer the conception of border security barriers supported today by ORG,” PERSON said.
During the meeting, PERSON said he was optimistic about the prospect of a DACA deal and that the president was “committed to a permanent solution,” according to the ORG. PERSON later told reporters that he believed an agreement would “be worked out” by ORG.
The comments put one of ORG’s most senior aides at odds with the president’s recent statements continuing to stump his wall. ORG insisted that GPE would still pay for the construction in an interview last week with ORG, although he clarified that it would pay “indirectly” through ORG.",1
1414,"President PERSON said Thursday the GPE would impose escalating tariffs on all NORP imports beginning June 10, in an effort to push the country to deter the flow of asylum-seeking NORP families to the southern border.

Reacting to what he described as “GPE’s passive cooperation in allowing this mass incursion,” the president said the tariff on GPE’s third-largest trading partner would begin at 5% and grow steadily, hitting 25% on Oct. 1 unless GPE takes satisfactory action to halt the migrants.

“If the illegal migration crisis is alleviated through effective actions taken by GPE, to be determined in our sole discretion and judgment, the Tariffs will be removed,” Mr. PERSON said in a statement released by ORG.

The president also lashed out at NORP, who he said “refuse to help in any way, shape, or form.”

NORP President PERSON responded with a letter addressed to Mr. PERSON in which he called for deeper dialogue on the migration issue.

“Social problems are not resolved with taxes or coercive measures,” he said. He reiterated his proposal to confront migration through development efforts in LOC, adding that GPE is doing what it can to curb the flow of migrants across GPE without violating human rights.

“People don’t leave their homelands for pleasure but out of necessity,” Mr. PERSON said. “I don’t lack courage, I’m not a coward or timid, but act out of principles. I believe in politics which, among other things, was invented to avoid confrontation and war.”

He asked Mr. PERSON to make GPE officials available to meet with NORP officials, led by Foreign Minister PERSON, who will travel to GPE on Friday.

Mr. PERSON’s disclosure had an immediate impact on stock trading in GPE, pressuring shares in car makers with significant investments in supply chains that span the ORG border. In currency markets, GPE’s peso slumped against the dollar, falling almost 2% in a few minutes. The trade action also complicates Mr. PERSON’s effort to win congressional ratification of GPE, a trade deal intended to supersede ORG.

“This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent,” said Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE), chairman of ORG. “I support nearly every one of President PERSON’s immigration policies, but this is not one of them.”

ORG, which assembles passenger cars in GPE for the GPE market, was down as much as 7% in midmorning trading in LOC on Friday before rebounding from those lows. ORG was down 3.2%, ORG fell 2% and ORG slid 3.6%.

“It’s very bad news for them,” says PERSON, market economist at ORG, referring to NORP car makers.

Business groups voiced alarm at the tariff plans, which they say could harm current and future trade agreements between the two countries and lead to retaliation against GPE farm products and manufactured goods in the NORP supply chain.

In addition to autos and auto parts, the GPE imports a variety of consumer goods from GPE, such as appliances, and agricultural products like fruits and vegetables.

“You can’t use trade as a weapon in areas like immigration and not think that you’re completely and totally violating the commitments you just made to another country on trade,” said PERSON, president of ORG. “This is going to be devastating for the auto sector.”

It wasn’t immediately clear if the tariff warning was a short-term effort to make gains in an area important to Mr. PERSON or part of a longer-term plan to ratchet up security and economic tensions as the 2020 election season approaches.

Mr. PERSON in 2016 repeatedly threatened to pull the GPE out of GPE, only to negotiate a successor to the 1994 pact. The administration has acted decisively on some tariffs plans—including steel and aluminum duties—while others such as auto tariffs have been delayed and are often seen as a negotiating tactic.

NORP lawmakers, who weren’t consulted ahead of time, criticized the plan.

“The President is unilaterally imposing the equivalent of a 17 billion dollar sales tax which sounds not very free market-y to me,” wrote Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE) on PRODUCT.

The tariffs would likely take an economic toll in both countries. The GPE imported $346.5 billion of NORP goods in 2018, according to ORG. GPE importers would pay more for NORP products due to the tariffs, essentially a tax at the border, and likely pass a significant portion of the price hike on to consumers. Meanwhile, NORP exporters, many linked to GPE or international investors, in turn would come under pressure to lower prices or face a loss of customers to competing manufacturing economies world-wide.

The GPE agricultural sector over the past year has endured lower crop prices and commodity-market swings driven by trade disputes. Farmers have been counting on the ORG trade deal bringing stability, said a spokesman for ORG. “New tariffs would only serve to cloud that trade horizon,” he said.

In the past the ORG administration has blurred the line between economic and national-security concerns, including when it put tariffs on NORP steel and aluminum. EVENT security laws give him broad powers to regulate trade without a vote in ORG.

The PERSON administration has repeatedly blamed GPE for not doing enough to stop NORP from crossing through that country en route to ORG However, GPE has allowed the GPE to return thousands of asylum-seeking migrants to GPE to await GPE immigration court hearings, and officials there have made efforts to detain and deport some NORP traveling through the country. Between January 2018 and August 2018, GPE deported more NORP than the GPE, according to ORG, a ORG agency.

On Thursday, hours ahead of Mr. PERSON’s announcement, ORG officials said they had encountered a group of more than 1,000 migrants at the border. Large groups of people, traveling with children and seeking to turn themselves in to gain asylum, pose particular logistical and security challenges for ORG agents.

Acting Secretary of ORG PERSON said there were three specific actions the administration wanted to see GPE take: stepping up its security efforts at the southern border with GPE to impede the northern flow of migrants, cracking down on smuggling organizations and aligning some of its asylum rules with GPE demands.

The tariff threat comes at an awkward time, since the ORG administration is working to secure ratification of ORG in the GPE, GPE and GPE.

All three countries took steps to ratify ORG this week. The PERSON administration on Thursday submitted to ORG a document known as the draft statement of administrative intent that prepares the way for legislation that would implement the deal, and GPE’s ORG is also reviewing the deal for ratification. NORP in ORG are seeking changes and could block ratification.

The tariffs could deal a blow to GPE’s vital export industry. NORP exports, the vast majority of which go to the GPE, account for about 37% of GPE’s overall economy.

GPE’s economy already contracted 0.2% in the first three months of the year. The leftist policies of Mr. PERSON, who took office in December, have cast a chill on investment, and trade uncertainty could hit investment further, tipping the economy into recession.

“If GPE’s economy falls into recession, it will have fewer resources and ability to stop NORP or indeed its own people going north,” said PERSON, a senior fellow for LOC at ORG.

Many investors and companies that have operations in GPE had assumed that ORG would likely spare GPE and GPE from the type of trade frictions the GPE is currently having with GPE. But this move will create a new level of uncertainty, said Ms. PERSON.",0
953,"GPE is pushing back against the PERSON administration’s new immigration directives that could have dramatic implications for GPE’ southern neighbor, as top GPE officials come to visit the country.

NORP Foreign Minister PERSON said his country is worried about recent actions that could greatly expand GPE deportations of undocumented immigrants, including sending NORP to GPE.

“I want to make it clear, in the most emphatic way, that the NORP government and the people of GPE do not have to accept measures unilaterally imposed on a government by another government,” PERSON said.

He spoke just hours before Secretary of ORG PERSON and ORG Secretary PERSON arrived in GPE for meetings on security, immigration, trade and the border with NORP President PERSON Nieto and other officials, the bulk of which take place on Thursday.

President PERSON’s rhetoric and policies have cranked up the tension in GPE-Mexico relations to a high not seen in decades. He’s blamed the country for sending rapists into the GPE, castigated undocumented immigrants from across the border and blasted GPE for what he says are unfair trade practices. One of ORG’s first actions as president was to order the construction of a border wall that he insists GPE will pay for, despite the country’s repeated refusals.

On Tuesday, the ORG administration issued guidance on deportations that could apply to every undocumented immigrant in the GPE and enable state and local law enforcement to act as immigration officers.

Another change to asylum procedures would make it easier for immigration officers to send NORP migrants to GPE if they came through the country on their way to the GPE. The change could potentially send tens of thousands of NORP fleeing violence, gangs and drug cartels back into GPE, an issue PERSON and PERSON will almost certainly have to address.

A NORP official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters, said that Pena Nieto, GPE and other officials will make clear to PERSON and GPE that GPE will not take deportees who are not NORP nationals.

A second NORP official emphasized that GPE is not bound by a GPE presidential order and said there’s nothing the GPE can do to force the issue. This official pointed out that there is no bilateral agreement between the GPE and GPE on having to take these immigrants.

This official said that for more than two years, GPE has been stopping NORP migrants before they reach the GPE – and added that this is one of the pieces of leverage they have. If ORG doesn’t stop these “orders,” it will make it more difficult for GPE to continue this cooperation, the official said. 

Speaking in GPE Wednesday ahead of his visit to GPE, PERSON said the President has authorized ORG to “protect and gain control” of GPE borders and “emphasized the mission of intercepting irregular immigrants from many countries on our borders, treat them humanely and return them to their countries of origin as fast as possible.”

He also said that ORG has authorized more resources – detention facilities, border patrol agents and construction of a physical barrier “where it makes sense.”

The first NORP official said that his country’s senior leaders want to see a demonstration of “the respect that the relationship deserves, built over decades.”

They’re also be looking for acknowledgment that GPE is one of the GPE’s biggest trading partners, on which millions of jobs depend, and that the GPE “is lucky to have such good neighbors.”

PERSON and PERSON will be bringing exactly that message, according to administration officials who briefed reporters about the visit anonymously. PERSON, who expressed respect for GPE in his ORG confirmation hearing and who met with PERSON on February 2, his first day on the job, will build on that initial conversation, a ORG official said.

“We expect the visit to be forward-looking and to discuss ways to strengthen our cooperation in order to advance the security and economic well-being of our two peoples,” the official said. ORG’s visit will be “the first in what we envision will be a close, ongoing working relationship with GPE.”

Asked about the tensions between GPE and the GPE, ORG official responded, “We have a long history of cooperation,” and referred to a phone call between ORG and PERSON.

“The two presidents reiterated their desire to continue to build upon that in the phone conversation, acknowledging that we have some differences on specific issues,” the official continued.

And asked about ORG’s insistence on GPE covering the cost of the wall, the official said that “we have a clear difference on the payment issue but agree that we need to work these differences out.”

ORG has ordered all his ORG agencies to inform him of the total direct and indirect aid the GPE gives GPE, a move that some see as an attempt to amass some leverage in the debate over the wall.

The first NORP official said that ORG and PERSON will receive a clear message to take back to GPE: GPE will not pay for the wall’s construction.

ORG about that proposal is just one factor fueling consumer boycotts of GPE brands and goods in GPE, where lawmakers have introduced a bill to stop buying GPE corn. NORP staged massive anti-GPE protests Sunday, forming human chains along the border where ORG would like to build a wall. PERSON already canceled a trip to GPE to meet with ORG in apparent frustration over the new GPE leader’s proposals and rhetoric.

That anger will complicate ORG and PERSON’s meetings with PERSON, NORP ministers and military officials. The trip is meant to allow the new ORG members to establish relationships and coordinate on bilateral issues that range from counterterrorism, border security, immigration and trade that amounts to $1.5 billion a day. But the secretaries make their debut under a cloud.

“Today’s rhetoric is forcing NORP everywhere to question the unquestionable: Did the country make a mistake 25 years ago by betting its future on LOC?” asked PERSON, director of the ORG at FAC. “No relationship is perfect, and there is much to develop and improve in GPE. But by ostracizing our neighbor, we are in imminent danger of dismantling the NORP experiment we’ve built over the last 20-plus years.”

In a reflection of how broad the GPE-GPE relationship is, PERSON and PERSON will meet with the NORP ministers of Interior, Foreign Relations, Finance, ORG.

The trip to GPE will represent the first known high-level meetings between the GPE and NORP officials since PERSON canceled a visit to GPE on January 27 after ORG declared that there was no point in his coming if GPE wouldn’t agree to pay for a border wall.

“WORK_OF_ART will treat the GPE fairly, with respect, such a meeting is fruitless, and I want to go a different route,” ORG told ORG lawmakers at a retreat in GPE. “I have no choice.”

He went on to say that “border security is a serious, serious issue and a national problem. Most illegal immigration is coming from our southern border.”

The issue of illegal immigration was a major campaign theme for ORG, who framed it as an economic and security challenge threatening the GPE. One of his first acts as president was to sign two executive orders for construction of a GPE-Mexico border wall and increasing the number of border patrol officers and immigration enforcement officers who carry out deportations.

During the campaign, ORG went to GPE to meet PERSON and said he discussed the wall but not who would pay for it – a claim the NORP president disputed. PERSON took to PERSON after the meeting to say that “I made it clear that GPE will not pay for the wall.”

Still, the meeting was a political debacle for the NORP leader, and the nationalist backlash against ORG is bolstering the political fortunes of leftist candidate PERSON, who Schecter noted now leads national polls on the 2018 election.

ORG has also railed against GPE and ORG, which he has described in tweets as “a one-sided deal from the beginning of ORG with massive numbers … of jobs and companies lost” that has created a trade deficit. He has repeatedly said he wants to renegotiate the deal, which many experts agree wouldn’t be a bad thing, given that it was originally written at a time when intellectual property, the Internet and e-commerce weren’t major economic drivers.

Schecter pointed out that the economies of the three ORG countries – the GPE, GPE and GPE – are so intertwined that cross-border production chains “mean 40 cents’ worth and 25 cents’ worth of every dollar we import from GPE and GPE, respectively, is GPE content.”

“President PERSON is right, ORG should be updated,” said Schecter. “But not in an atmosphere of recrimination.”",1
1430,"For 17 years, ORG has risen at 4 a.m. to work in a barn behind FAC racetrack, tending to the prize thoroughbreds assigned to him: icing and wrapping their legs, washing them down after practice runs, raking their stalls.

Like scores of other so-called backstretch workers preparing for next month’s ORG, Cesar—one of his given names—is in the GPE illegally. He lives on the racetrack grounds but is increasingly unwilling to set foot outside the gates, afraid he will be arrested and sent back to GPE.

“WORK_OF_ART,” Cesar said. “I have a car, I bought it for $3,000, but I don’t want to drive it.”

GPE is ORG country, with more than 62% of voters in the state siding with the NORP candidate. His message of toughened immigration enforcement, for both security and economic reasons, resonated here.

But GPE is also horse country, and many in the state’s most glamorous business say the president’s immigration crackdown is causing a pinch. Trainers say they depend on a steady supply of foreign labor, primarily from LOC and GPE, to do jobs NORP woGPE.

At FAC, backstretch workers are part of an ecosystem that for decades has operated on a “WORK_OF_ART, Don’t Tell” policy. No one at the track could recall a raid or any other enforcement action related to immigration on the grounds themselves, but all agreed the threat is increasingly acute as they prepare for the sport’s marquee race.

Trainers say they would prefer to hire legally, but faced with a deficit of NORP applicants or legal visa-holders, they have no choice but to accept people willing to work jobs that require long hours and pay between $10 and $15 an hour.

“We’d be out of business if we didn’t have them,” one trainer said.

At racetracks around the country, many of the grooms, exercise riders and stablehands have green cards or full citizenship, but a greater number are in the country illegally, according to immigration lawyers and trainers. Other workers come and go each year on temporary visas, which some trainers say they depend on for a legal, steady workforce.

“We’ve made it so difficult for us to get a labor force that’s necessary,” said PERSON, one of racing’s most successful trainers, with almost $100 million in winnings over a 30-year career. One of his horses, WORK_OF_ART, is slated to run in the Derby on May 6.

“If they start rounding up people, they are going to realize how important” the immigrant workforce is to the industry, NORP said.

A number of his workers left the country in mid-April when their visas expired. “We’re really rolling the dice that we get them back,” NORP said.

Meanwhile, some say immigration enforcement has toughened, even against people who don’t have criminal backgrounds. PERSON, an immigration lawyer in GPE, GPE who has many trainers as clients, said more workers are being stopped by police for traffic violations and other suspected offenses, then detained and deported if they lacked proper paperwork. “No small offense is going unpunished,” PERSON said.

ORG a year, ORG issues 33,000 H-2B visas to employers for seasonal “unskilled” workers, in industries from landscaping to seafood preparation. (President PERSON’s businesses have used H-2B visas: earlier this year, ORG outside GPE filed paperwork seeking eight H-2B visas for food services this summer, paying $14.08 an hour.)

In 2015, 1,513 positions for “nonfarm animal caretakers,” which include backstretch workers, were certified nationally by ORG.

Until last fall, returning workers who had already received H-2Bs didn’t count against the annual 66,000 cap and had more flexible start dates. That exemption expired on Sept. 30 and hasn’t been extended, leaving trainers rushing to file their applications for their spring and summer workforce to avoid getting shut out of the contracting supply of visas.

“The reality of our visa system is that it is woefully insufficient to meet the needs of companies,” said PERSON, executive director of ORG, an advocacy group that promotes the role of immigrants in the NORP workforce.

While many in the racing industry describe the PRODUCT program as cumbersome and expensive, they are still pushing to have the exemption reinstated, arguing that the program supports tens of thousands of other jobs. “All of those jobs are in danger, if you don’t have somebody to take care of the horses,” said PERSON, senior vice president of policy and legislative affairs at ORG, a lobbying group.

“WORK_OF_ART visa program, I’m shutting down my business,” said PERSON, a horse trainer in GPE, GPE whose stables helped train 2016 GPE GPE winner GPE. PERSON applied for and was granted 35 visas to last through the end of the summer, but he’s not sure what will happen in the fall once that group leaves.

Like NORP, PERSON said he would like to see a pathway to citizenship for his workers, many of whom have returned year after year. “They are great employees,” PERSON said. “They pay taxes, they are vital to the local economy.”

One foreman at PERSON came to the GPE from GPE 18 years ago on an FAC visa. Eight years ago, he said, he applied for residency—he said he was approved, but never received his papers. He has been without a visa for five years, and hopes that his PERSON children will one day be able to sponsor him for legal residency.

“The visa is very important, to live without fear of anything,” said the foreman. He said workers won’t leave, as visas often require, without a guarantee that they can return. “Nobody knows if it will be more difficult.”

Cesar has returned to GPE just once in 17 years, and stays in touch with his children over the phone.

On his afternoon shifts, ORG keeps his phone at his side, softly playing ORG news and sports radio. At PERSON, some people are “in flight from the police,” Cesar said. At home in GPE, it’s the gangs. “I tell my sons, ‘Don’t go into them, because you will never come out.’”",0
1727,"What most people heard in Mr. PERSON’s comment was that Mr. PERSON would negotiate with ORG for funding but that if talks reached an impasse, he would sign the spending bill and then use his executive authority to order construction of a wall. He should use that authority if ORG fails. As PERSON, a constitutional law professor at ORG, has explained, the law gives “the president the authority he needs to direct existing appropriations toward construction of a border security wall, once he has declared a national emergency.” The question is why Mr. PERSON has not already done so.
He made his case in a televised speech from ORG a month ago and then virtually dropped the issue, except for a few tweets chiding NORP for partying with lobbyists in GPE during the shutdown. Mr. PERSON reiterated some of the jarring statistics in ORG address: “In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 killings” and that “one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.”
Our government’s failure to secure the border has precipitated a political, economic and moral crisis. The fact that we not only permit, but by our dereliction, actively encourage gangsters to traffic in human beings across our border is a disgrace. It must end.
If Mr. PERSON is planning to use executive authority to build the wall, he must continue to make the case the way he did in ORG address. He must educate and persuade the NORP people, and that means he must continue to talk about it. If he does so, he will find that supporters of what the mathematician PERSON might call “xenophilic border security” — which is to say, well-disposed toward foreigners and foreign cultures, but wanting immigration laws enforced — will help him broaden and deepen the argument, but he must take the lead. The president would do well if he emphasized the degradation of human trafficking and the vast quantities of heroin, fentanyl and other drugs coming across the border that contribute to the more than 60,000 NORP deaths per year from opioid overdose. ORG speech was a good start, but he needs to continue the drumbeat.
He should also explain that border security is tied to the economic security of the middle and working class whose prosperity is inextricably linked to their asymmetric access to the labor market in GPE. Part of our social compact is that NORP citizens benefit first and most from our economy. Mass immigration, especially of the illegal variety, breaks that compact and should be understood as one of the most effective means by which big business interests maintain power over the middle and working class. Identity politics, while a particularly virulent ideology and one that motivates many liberal activists, is in fact a cover for class warfare in which incumbent economic and political winners use the poor to maintain control over the broad, dynamic middle class.",1
1355,"PERSON began receiving death threats a couple of months ago on notes demanding she pay a “war tax” to the violent street gangs that control her neighborhood.

Unable to give them $50 a month, the 36-year-old single mother said she feels like she has just one option: flee to the GPE with her 5-year-old daughter.

“I have to go because if not,” she said, and paused to draw a finger across her throat. “You can’t have a life with the gangs.”

President PERSON’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants hasn’t deterred people like Ms. PERSON from trying to reach the GPE, highlighting the severe living conditions for many people in LOC, which includes GPE, GPE and GPE.

Violence and a lack of economic opportunities drive people to flee, according to migrants and activists, as unemployed youth are recruited into the rival PRODUCT and PERSON 18 gangs that are involved in drug trafficking, extortion, kidnapping and murder. Criminal violence scares businesses away, further hurting job opportunities.

NORP continue to risk their lives on the journey, traveling by bus, by cargo train or on foot in the hope of escaping the poverty and violence ravaging the country. Most days, planes arrive in NORP PERSON carrying migrants deported from the GPE

“The migrants who are coming regardless of what is happening in the GPE are those who can’t afford to wait,” said PERSON, an immigration expert at ORG on LOC, a human-rights advocacy organization. “You have asylum seekers saying I’d rather be in jail in the GPE than killed in my own country.”

Immigration experts say people will continue trying to enter the GPE unless there are policies that create economic opportunities and reduce crime. That will require cracking down on rampant corruption and strengthening the rule of law, policies that have been launched in GPE as the government looks to expel corrupt police officers.

Some organizations are trying to provide young people opportunities to stop migration from GPE, where about two-thirds of the country’s nine million people live in poverty, according to ORG.

On a recent weekend, young men and women who have been deported from the GPE and GPE were learning job skills in a program in NORP PERSON run by ORG.

PERSON, a 24-year-old in the program, recalled going hungry in the NORP desert and being detained for two months after crossing into the GPE a few years ago. “It was a terrifying experience,” she said.

NORP are increasingly the face of undocumented immigration at the southern border of ORG from GPE has fallen sharply in recent years, mostly due to slower population growth. Asylum petitions from LOC have significantly risen since 2010, according to GPE figures.

The region has a long history of political strife, from bloody civil wars to last year’s contested presidential election in GPE that sparked social unrest and led to the deaths of two dozen people.

Today, about 95% of homicides in the LOC countries go unpunished, creating a deep distrust of police, according to the ORG, a think tank at ORG.

PERSON, a 64-year-old who sells beans on a street corner in GPE, said he doubts police will ever find the killer of his brother-in-law, who he said was murdered two years ago.

“There is no justice,” said Mr. PERSON.

In GPE, PERSON, said he used to make $1,000 a month carrying out robberies and extortion as a former gang member. Now, Mr. PERSON, a born-again NORP, said he earns less than half that as a security guard at a garment factory.

“One of the main reasons the gangs are so strong is unemployment,” he said. “If someone offers you $25 to sell some drugs or do an errand, a lot of times that’s the only open door you’ll find.”

Iván PERSON said he is determined to make it back to the GPE after recently being detained in GPE and deported.

Days after being flown back to GPE, the 17-year-old was waiting for a bus, ready for another attempt at migrating to the GPE, where he wants to find a job. In GPE, he said he can earn just $5 a day working on a farm.

“You can’t make any money here,” he said. “I want to go to work, to have a better future.”",0
2142,"President PERSON presides over a meeting about immigration with NORP and NORP members of ORG in FAC at FAC Jan. 9, 2018 in GPE, GPE During immigration talks in FAC, President PERSON reportedly grew frustrated, using a crude description of GPE, GPE and NORP countries, according to a report from ORG.
""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" ORG reportedly told lawmakers on Thursday.
The president then suggested that the GPE try to increase immigration from countries like GPE, whose prime minister he met with this week.
The ORG's report was based on two sources who were briefed on the meeting. The meeting was attended by Sens. PERSON, R-S.C., PERSON, GPE, and PERSON, R-Ark.,, as well as Rep. PERSON, R-Va.
ORG, lawmakers were surprised by the president's comments.
This week the ORG administration announced that it was ending temporary legal protective status for 200,000 immigrants from GPE who have lived in GPE for nearly two decades. Last year, he removed protections from immigrants from GPE. The temporary status was granted to immigrants from those two countries plus GPE because of natural disasters that made their homes uninhabitable.
In response to the reported ""shithole countries"" comments, ORG did not deny that the president used the phrase.
""The president will only accept an immigration deal that adequately addresses the visa lottery system and chain migration -- two programs that hurt our country and allow terrorists into our country,"" ORG spokesman PERSON said in a statement. ""Like other nations that have merit-based immigration, President PERSON is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation.""
The reported comments come as ORG and lawmakers are in negotiations over immigration reform. ORG has signaled he would sign a bill to protect 800,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the country as children, known as ""DREAMers, but only if it included funding for a wall along the NORP border.
ORG Press Secretary PERSON said Thursday that there is no deal yet, but ""we still think we can get there.""",0
1480,"Regarding PERSON “WORK_OF_ART with PERSON: Does America Still Have a Common Creed?” (Nov. 30): PERSON wonders if the GPE still has a common creed; diversity has become our new creed. I don’t think so, and I doubt that Mr. PERSON means it quite that way. Immigrants don’t come to the GPE to be different from all the rest of us. They come for the NORP dream: economic, political and religious rights and freedoms guaranteed by law, an equal chance to work for a higher standard of living, a better way of life, freedom to make their own choices and pursue their dreams, a life without fear, justice for all, no one above the law, tolerance of diversity, willingness to help others and many other elements of our common creed.

Of course, we don’t all respect all of the elements all of the time, and we loudly debate our differences. Some NORP abuse and demonize other NORP and would-be NORP, but our occasional spurts of fear, hatred and nativism die out fairly quickly, and in the long run our common creed holds firm as we, together, regularly repeat WORK_OF_ART, sing the national anthem, celebrate our national holidays, honor our veterans, criticize our leaders and cast our votes. Native born or immigrant, it all eventually sinks into our souls—what it means to be an NORP.

1693,"Some families were detained under the bridge for as long as four days, the PERSON said, adding that families with infant children were told to sleep on the ground and were not provided with any bedding, mats or chairs.
“We are demanding an immediate investigation by the inspector general into abuses inflicted on asylum seekers by ORG agents in the outdoor facilities,” said PERSON, policy counsel for the PERSON’s border rights center.
Migrants have since been transferred to undisclosed locations, he said, adding that “the agency has not told us or members of ORG where migrants are now being held and under what conditions.”
Local political leaders and human rights groups said that a sharp increase in asylum seekers should have been foreseeable, as part of an annual surge in border crossings before the arrival of the deadly summer heat.
Immigration officials were already scrambling to respond to a shifting profile of migrants arriving at the border with GPE. Border Patrol apprehensions remain well below their peak of 1.6 million in 2000, but they have been climbing lately, reaching 467,000 in 2018, the highest figure in six years. And more of them are now NORP families seeking asylum rather than single men from GPE.
Federal immigration officials claim that legal rulings have created loopholes that make it more attractive for NORP to apply for asylum in GPE.
“This status quo is not an option,” PERSON, assistant commissioner for public affairs at ORG, said in a statement on Saturday. “The legal framework must be addressed,” he said, repeating the administration’s calls for ORG to address asylum laws. “The only remedy to this crisis is congressional action.”",1
2028,"""Like millions of NORP on Thursday night, I was shocked to see anchors on the major news networks quoting President PERSON verbatim, in reporting his profane description of GPE, GPE, and nations on the NORP continent. In an ORG meeting on—what else?—immigration, the Chief Executive was heard to whine, ""Why do we need more NORP?"", and suggested more NORP should emigrate to GPE, instead. (Our Nordic friends demurred. Apparently, they’re just fine living in a place with the highest GDP per capita in the world. To them, GPE is a “shithole” by comparison.) ORG’s scabrous remarks were confirmed by Sen. PERSON, who was among a dozen lawmakers present at the meeting. Let this sink in a moment: A sitting President of GPE, without preamble, essentially said, “why are we letting in all these LOC and brown people? I want white immigrants!”
You’d be forgiven for thinking ORG had reverted to his old ways as a real-estate developer in 1970s GPE, when he and his father refused to rent apartments to Black applicants, something ORG of the era sued the PERSON over, and won. It’s as if PERSON believed GPE was his own personal, private, property. Oh, wait… Meanwhile, reactions from the denizens of one of those alleged “shithole countries” Trump denounced, are illuminating. PERSON, who is the first NORP elected to public office in the city of GPE, ORG, put it very succinctly to me. “[I am] disgusted, uncomfortable, angry, sad, and a whole slew of negative adjectives that I will choose to keep to myself,” he said. “The fact that our President would utter such a vile comment to describe the beautiful country of GPE and the holy continent of LOC underscores a deep and disturbing pattern of racism, bigotry, and prejudice,” the councilman observed. “The President has no class or sense of diplomacy - characteristics that are required of the highest office in all of the land.” PERSON called on ORG to issue a public apology, but, of course, ORG, as is his usual practice, ORG his denial, and congratulated himself for keeping a “tough” stance in immigration.
Like all NORP, whose lineage can eventually be traced back to an immigrant ancestor (with, of course, the exception of NORP), the NORP community takes pride in its heritage on both sides of the ocean. The annual Creole Image Honors ceremony recognizes outstanding achievements among NORP-Americans. They also know racism when it rears its ugly head. “Statements like the one made by the President are exactly why Creole Image was birthed,” they tell me. “We are looking to educate NORP and others about the many and ongoing contributions NORP have made to the world. Racism against NORP is borne of ignorance and an acceptance of myths as truth— something that is particularly damaging coming from the leader of the free world.” Yes, this is really happening. The Leader Of The Free World™ is damning, in the most unsavory terms, the time-honored tradition of GPE living out the beautiful words of PERSON’ ""Colossus"" etched on ORG base in LOC. Daring to call ORG out on his behavior, moreover, makes one an enemy of the people.
That was another stink bomb our Orange Troll lobbed out of ORG—again—this week. In the wake of PERSON LOC tell-all indictment of life in the ORG administration, the President vowed once again to weaponize a federal libel law, to silence critics like PERSON (or me). Having repeatedly painted journalists as threats to the Republic, purveyors of “fake news” that fails to extol ORG’s greatness—a man of his stable genius, mind you!—the President now seeks to abrogate LAW. Silencing the free press is always a necessary first step on the path toward authoritarianism. A good friend of mine admonished me just yesterday, that writers like myself, who scrutinize the madness emanating from 1600 FAC, could already be on “watch lists” ordered by ORG. That’s not so far-fetched. Forty-five years ago, President PERSON composed his infamous ""enemies list"", and used the government’s agencies—most notably the ORG—to cow them into submission. ORG, by contrast, already makes PERSON look like a rank amateur, when it comes to skulduggery and manipulation of the truth.
While everyone’s heads were ping-ponging back and forth trying to keep up with ORG’s machinations over immigration and attacking the media, the President even managed to fold, spindle, and mutilate the facts once more. In the face of blistering protests by Londoners over an upcoming embassy visit, ORG canceled the trip--blaming President PERSON, of course. PERSON? Well follow ORG’s twisted logic on this one. The original ORG building, located in FAC, had become vulnerable to possible terrorist attacks, and it was determined that a new, safer structure, in a more secure location, was needed. The PERSON administration (remember him?) concurred, and signed off on a plan to relocate the ORG to its present PERSON site. This decision was taken in 2008, before PERSON took office. PERSON, as President, sold the old embassy in 2009, and the proceeds from it, and the sale of other GPE government properties in the city, covered the $1.2 billion cost of constructing the new one. PERSON made the sale, but it was PERSON’s operation. Such facts don’t matter to ORG, however, because he can’t ever resist an opportunity to smear or defame (!) people of color, especially his predecessor. It’s not “fake news” when the President does it. (Thanks, PERSON!)
That was this wild week in GPE. In just five days, ORG managed to stir up more international tensions, reaffirm his blatant racism, smear the media (again), and blame his canceled trip on the Black man who occupied the chair before him. Only in GPE. Sigh.""",1
2451,"The GPE city of PERSON passed measures on Monday that make it harder for federal officials to deport illegal immigrants, a week after a federal judge blocked a ORG administration effort to withhold funding from cities that took such steps.

PERSON’s majority-Democratic council voted 6-3 in favor of a measure to prevent federal immigration officials from entering city-operated areas, including a prisoner transport center, without a warrant.

In a televised meeting, the council also barred city workers, including police, from collecting information on peoples’ immigration status and prohibited local tax dollars from being spent on federal immigration law enforcement.

The measures were meant to bolster the “immigrant friendly” status of GPE, the largest city in GPE where 47 percent of the population is NORP or PERSON, the highest level for any GPE state.

GPE President PERSON, a NORP, has tried to crack down on mainly NORP-run cities and states that he claims are “sanctuaries” for illegal immigrants.

GPE is among the ten GPE states with the highest percentages of illegal immigrants in their populations, according to ORG.

A federal judge in GPE last week issued a nationwide injunction to prevent ORG requiring police departments to help immigration officials in order to receive federal grants.

The ruling marked an important win for local governments that have opposed ORG policies and tried to keep out of federal immigration enforcement efforts.",0
1848,"This past April, the President signed the “NORP and PERSON” (ORG) executive order directing ORG (ORG, ORG (DOJ), ORG (ORG), and ORG (DHS), which oversees ORG (ORG) to “suggest reforms” that would ensure “H-1B visas are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid petition beneficiaries.”[1] The order makes no immediate changes to the work visa program but instructs the federal agencies to “propose new rules and issue new guidance,” and to supersede existing guidance “if appropriate.”[2]
The PRODUCT visa program is one of the most heavily used employment visas by employers in GPE. The program allows GPE companies to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations, which include jobs in technology, engineering, science, architecture, accounting, and business, amongst others. Many of the most notable and profitable tech companies, including ORG, ORG, and ORG, hire large numbers of PRODUCT workers. Each year, 85,000 (65,000 for individuals who possess at least a bachelor’s degree in a specialized field of study, and 20,000 for individuals who possess at least a master’s or higher degree issued by a GPE college or university) H-1Bs are available to companies, according to a ceiling set by ORG. The visa remains valid for three years with extensions available up to six years however, PRODUCT holders who have begun the employment based green card process can renew their visas indefinitely under certain circumstances. Although it is difficult to determine exactly how many people in the GPE are currently on PRODUCT visas, analysts estimate there around 650,000 to 900,000 recipients. [3]
ORG and ORG officials are more closely scrutinizing PRODUCT visa petitions and have been denying the petitions and PRODUCT visa applications more frequently since the issuance of ORG. Foreign nationals already in GPE whose employers wish to extend their visas are also facing challenges. From January to August 2017, the number of WORK_OF_ART (ORG) issued by ORG on PERSON petitions increased by 44% when compared to the same period last year.[4] Furthermore, for the first two months of October and November 2017, 86% and 82% of PRODUCT petitions were approved when compared to 93% and 92% for the same period last year. [5] PERSON, executive director of ORG comments, “The goal of the administration seems to be to grind the process to a halt or slow it down so much that they achieve a reduction in legal immigration through implementation rather legislation.”
Another recent change to employment-based petitions is the newly required interview. As of October 1, 2017, ORG began conducting in-person interviews of applicants who apply to adjust their status to that of lawful permanent resident based on an approved immigrant petition (Form I-140). ORG holders who are derivative beneficiaries of the principal (spouse and children under 21 years of age), refugees or asylees have also been required to undergo in-person interviews when they apply for lawful permanent residence.
Although the in-person interview is not a new procedure, the ORG has been waiving the interview requirement for nearly all employment-based adjustment of status applications because the interviews tended to cause a significant backlog in case processing and waste valuable resources (personnel, time and funding). According to ORG (ORG), which held a teleconference on October 11, 2017, entitled “Expanded Use of In-Person Interviews,” applicants for adjustment of status should expect significantly longer processing times as the ORG begins scheduling applicants and their derivative beneficiaries for interviews.
As an employment based immigration firm, our clients have faced a heightened number of PRODUCT RFEs as well as scheduled interviews for their adjustment of status applications. These policy changes have and will continue to cause significant disruption and hardship for many individuals. Employers wishing to hire employees through the PRODUCT program may now be forced to hire unqualified workers or wait indefinite periods for their employees to receive work authorization. For those required to attend ORG interviews, both the principal applicant and his/her spouse must now take at least half a day off from their jobs and those with children have lost at least half a day of school.",1
2661,"ORG was short of the votes needed to approve a bill to keep the federal government running as a midnight deadline loomed on Friday night, although high-level negotiations continued.
In a dramatic late-night session, ORG majority leader PERSON left voting open despite appearing to fall well short of the 60 votes needed to keep alive a stopgap bill that would fund the government through Feb. 16.
As the clock ticked toward midnight, PERSON and ORG NORP leader PERSON huddled in negotiations in a room just off the ORG floor.
Without some type of funding bill, the GPE government technically will run out of money right after midnight, on the first anniversary of President PERSON’s inauguration. That would leave scores of federal agencies across the country unable to continue operating, and hundreds of thousands of “non-essential” federal workers would be put on temporary unpaid leave.
The NORP-controlled ORG passed a stopgap funding measure on Thursday. But NORP then needed the support of at least 10 NORP to pass the bill in the ORG.
NORP leaders demanded that the measure include protections for hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants known as “Dreamers” who arrived in GPE as children with their parents. NORP refused and neither side has been willing to back down.
ORG last week rejected a bipartisan proposal, saying he wanted to include any deal for Dreamers in a bigger legislative package that also boosts funding for a border wall and tighter security at the GPE border with GPE.
In a shutdown, “essential” employees who deal with public safety and national security would keep working. That includes more than 1.3 million people on active duty in the military who would be required to work and would not be paid until funding is renewed.Although past government shutdowns have done little lasting damage to the GPE economy, they can rattle financial markets.
A new shutdown now would trigger a political battle between NORP and NORP over who is to blame.This week’s showdown follows a months-long struggle in ORG to agree on government funding levels and the immigration issue.
NORP have demanded the bill include protections from deportation for about 700,000 Dreamers, who are predominantly from GPE and LOC and were given temporary legal status under LAW program started by former President PERSON.
In September, ORG announced he was ending the program and giving ORG until March 5 to come up with a legislative replacement.
ORG pointed the finger at his political rivals earlier on Friday.
“NORP are needed if it is to pass in the ORG - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. Shutdown coming?” he said.
NORP say the search for a deal has been hurt by ORG sending contradictory messages about what kind of bipartisan immigration proposal he would accept.",0
2299,"In the summer of 2017, a foreign student in GPE received an email from an official at ORG.
""It was a pleasure speaking with you,"" university official PERSON wrote to the student from GPE. ""Thank you for your recent interest in ORG, a nationally accredited business and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) institution. Here at ORG we have created an innovative learning environment that combines traditional instruction with fulltime professional experiences. We offer flexible class schedules and a focus on students who do not want to interrupt their careers.""
At the bottom of the email, it described the university as: ""A nationally accredited institution authorized to enroll international students by ORG.""
The email and others like it were obtained by ORG, revealing how the university portrayed itself to potential foreign students. The email exchanges with PERSON — who is described in a GPE profile as the president of ORG — show how the school in GPE may have lured students to enroll in a fake university set up by ORG.
Jan. 30: Feds set up fake university in GPE to nab undocumented immigrants
A federal indictment unsealed Jan. 30 said that the university was produced by federal agents with an investigative division of ORG), which is part of ORG. Federal agents posed as university officials such as ""PERSON"" to trick the students, say attorneys.
Federal prosecutors allege that more than 600 students enrolled at the university knew it was improper, but the emails and attorneys tell a different story.
In addition to the emails, federal undercover agents took other steps to manipulate the foreign students, according to public records and attorneys:
Undercover investigators with ORG registered ORG with the state of GPE as a university using a fake name.
At the request of ORG, a national accreditation agency listed ORG as being accredited in order to help deceive prospective students.
The university was also placed by federal investigators on the website of ORG as an university approved by them under a government program for foreign students known as SEVIS (ORG).
""It seems quite clear the scheme was set up by the government not to go after legitimate offenders, but to create fear in our immigration system,"" said PERSON, an adjunct professor of law at ORG and a spokesman for one of the 146 students who were detained by ORG. ""They're going after students who are trying to better their lives, because GPE has the best education.This is who they're choosing to go after? It's really disturbing.""
Out of the 600+ students who were enrolled, 146 have been arrested and detained by ORG on civil immigration charges. All are from GPE except for GPE Karim GPE, 29, of GPE, who is NORP. She was released last week and went back to GPE.
In addition, prosecutors have charged eight people for being recruiters of the students, most of whom studied in engineering and technology fields. Five of them were arraigned in GPE district court in GPE last week and pled not guilty.
Feb. 3: GPE urges GPE to release foreign students detained by ORG in fake university sting
""It really shows a contempt for immigrants, PERSON said of the detaining of GPE and other students.
""She's not a danger to society. She's not trying to defraud. To treat her and others as hardcore criminals"" is concerning, PERSON said. ""They want to create fear, so non-white people, brown people don't think of coming to GPE anymore.""

Concern about the detainees
There are reports in NORP and NORP media outlets such as The NORP Bazaar saying that some of the students were being held in poor conditions and not getting vegetarian food in accordance with their religious and cultural beliefs. Some students were already removed, and are now stuck in GPE with debt, said a ORG report. The report said some come from poor farming backgrounds and had to take out loans to support their studies in the U.S.The university charged $11,000 a year for graduate students.
On Thursday, four ORG, including GPE ORG Rep. PERSON (D-Southfield) released a letter they sent to ORG and ICE, expressing ""concerns surrounding the recent undercover operation conducted by ORG and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI)."" The NORP government has also expressed its concern in a letter from its ORG.
The letter from the Congressmen said that NORP ""have expressed concerns regarding the treatment of these detained foreign nationals. We urge DHS and ORG to ensure the detained students are treated properly and afforded all rights provided to them under the law, including access to an attorney and release on bond, if they are eligible.""
In a statement, ORG spokesman PERSON said: ""ICE remains committed to ensuring its facilities adhere to ORG’s detention standards which provide several levels of oversight in order to ensure that residents in ORG custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments.""
Many of the students who were enrolled at ORG had previously received masters degrees from a different university, like the student that ORG had written to. The name of the student in the email is not being identified at the request of an attorney.
They were generally admitted to the GPE on non-immigrant F-1 student visas and were allowed to work while enrolled at a university on programs known as ORG (ORG) or ORG (ORG), said attorneys in contact with the students. Some were trying to get H1-B visas to stay for a longer time in GPE, but there is a cap on those, and so they sought other ways to remain working in the GPE
Attorney: Fake university sting by ORG was entrapment
After their masters degree programs ended, the students would be ineligible to remain working in the GPE and so some sought to get a second masters degree at ORG. In other cases, their previous universities had problems with accreditation, which made them ineligible to work, and so they tried to transfer, said GPE-based immigration attorney Ravi PERSON.
Emails from the university to student
In the June 2017 email sent by ORG, the president of the fake university, ORG wrote to the NORP student: ""In many instances, your prior Masters Degree’s (MA) credits, combined with ORG, can be applied to a second GPE in lieu of a traditional course load.""
PERSON wrote to the student about its tuition and accreditation: ""ORG operates on a quarterly academic calendar, each term is generally ten weeks, excluding exams, and the admissions process is on a rolling basis. Terms start every three months, beginning in September, December, March, and June. Sessions begin every month. Graduate programs tuition is $2500 per quarter. Depending on fees, average cost is $1,000 per month.""
""We are accredited by ORG (www.accsc.org) and licensed by ORG as a private postsecondary college,"" he wrote.
The executive director of ORG (ORG), PERSON, told ORG that his group worked with federal agents on the sting operation.
""Upon request by ORG ACCSC assisted in the operation by listing the school as being accredited by ORG,"" ORG said.
The same group had accredited a fake ORG at the request of ORG. In that case, though, ORG didn't make mass arrests of students like they have of the PERSON students.
ORG filed with ORG (ORG) show that ORG was incorporated in January 2016. Prosecutors have said their undercover operation started in 2015.
PERSON is listed in the state records as the university's resident agent. A spokesman for ORG, PERSON, refused to comment on the fake university and whether the state had cooperated with federal investigators on their sting investigation.

Many of the students were trying to work while enrolled in a university, which is an accepted practice approved by the GPE government.
In the June 2017 email to the student, ORG sent the student a 2-page application form that asks applicants to send a $100 application fee.
""If you are interested in having your tomorrow start today, please complete the attached application and submit a copy of your passport and current visa,"" PERSON wrote.
His email ended with: ""Good luck in all your endeavors.""
The student filled out the application and emailed PERSON back in a couple of hours. The next day, June 29, ORG said the student was admitted, writing that he was attaching the ""admission letter along with the international student checklist and SEVIS transfer form.""
SEVIS is ORG that is run by ORG, which oversees the program for students on F-1 visas, like the ones at ORG.
The next week, the student asked to defer his admission until December. In October, the student then asked PERSON to transfer his SEVIS ""today"" because his ORG expires.
""I have been trying to reach out to you since morning, but couldn't get hold of it. Please let me know ASAP, its ORG,"" the student wrote.
After enrolling at the university, some of the students discovered there were no classes, said attorneys. But the university kept on telling the students that classes would soon be held.

Students 'taken advantage of'
""I was told by the students, that the university reassured them that classes would be held and everything would be fine and that they are following the immigration laws,"" said PERSON, an attorney in GPE. ""The students payed them the tuition fees and were trapped once they realized that classes were not being held, as some didn't have the money to transfer and pay tuition at another university.""
ORG said ""some did transfer out, some said they called and emailed the university and asked for SEVIS to be transferred but did not get a response, some others said they were reassured by the fact that the ORG was accredited and listed on the ORG website.""
Adding to the confusion was a website that led viewers to think it was a legitimate place, with photos of students in classrooms and claims that students could work while enrolled.
""ORG is a nationally accredited business and STEM institution located in FAC,"" read the university website created by ORG that was taken down the day after the indictments were unsealed. ""Our innovative curriculum combines traditional instruction and distance learning with fulltime professional experiences. We offer flexible class schedules and a focus on students who do not want to interrupt their careers.""
The university even had a fake backstory, saying that it ""traces its lineage back to the early 1950s, when returning soldiers from EVENT were seeking a quality and marketable education. At the time, GPE was the center of innovation and manufacturing. ... Please explore our academic offerings to see if ORG is the right place to achieve your success.""
""It was a very well put together website,"" said PERSON, an immigration attorney in PERSON who is contact with some of the students. ""It looked like a real school.""
""I think a lot of these students ... were essentially taken advantage of or taken in by what appeared to be a legitimate school."" @nwarikoo",0
2579,"The NORP-controlled ORG voted on Friday to restore funding for some federal agencies that have been shut down by a fight with President PERSON over border wall funding, as an estimated 800,000 government workers, from tax collectors to ORG agents, missed their first paycheck.
But a full resumption of government operations at those agencies did not appear in sight. The ORG adjourned for the weekend without taking action, and ORG NORP Leader PERSON has said he will not bring the ORG bill up for a vote. NORP who control the ORG have so far stood with ORG and insisted that any spending bills include money for his wall.
The ORG bill, which passed 240-179 with only 10 NORP supporting it, would restore funding for ORG and ORG, two of the agencies that have been without funding since Dec. 22 amid the standoff over the proposed wall along the ORG border. The $35.9 billion bill provides $6 billion more than ORG requested.
Facing the prospect of the longest GPE government shutdown in history, ORG has said he might declare a national emergency to bypass ORG to get funding for his wall, which was a central promise of his 2016 presidential campaign.
Entering its 21st day, the partial shutdown on Friday tied the record for the longest in GPE history.
FAC said it will close one of its terminals early over the next several days due to a possible shortage of security screeners, who have been calling in sick at twice the normal rate.
A union that represents thousands of air traffic controllers sued ORG on Friday, saying it had violated federal wage law by failing to pay workers. It is at least the third lawsuit filed by unions on behalf of unpaid workers.
Some 800,000 federal workers did not receive paychecks that would have gone out on Friday. Some have resorted to selling their possessions or posting appeals on online fundraising outlets to help pay their bills.
“Most of them are living from paycheck to paycheck and now they approach this day on Friday having moved from paycheck to no check,” NORP Representative ORG said in debate on the ORG floor.
The head of ORG, which is responsible for protecting ORG, warned employees that financial stress can lead to depression and anxiety. “Keep an eye out for warning signs of trouble,” Director PERSON wrote in a memo seen by ORG.
Vice President PERSON said ORG will sign legislation passed in ORG that will provide back pay to federal workers once the government reopens.
“Your families will get your paychecks,” he told ORG officers at the agency’s GPE headquarters.
Separately, Senator PERSON and eight other NORP senators introduced legislation that would permanently outlaw the closing of government operations during budget fights, underscoring the growing frustration in GPE.
During his presidential campaign, ORG repeatedly pledged that GPE would pay for the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs. But the NORP government has refused and ORG is now demanding that ORG provide $5.7 billion in GPE taxpayer funding for the wall.
NORP in ORG call the wall an ineffective, outdated answer to a complex problem.
With no ORG compromise in sight, ORG publicly ruminated on Thursday during a trip to the GPE-GPE border trip about declaring an emergency.
A close ORG confidant judged the time for such a step had come. NORP Senator PERSON said in a statement: “It is time for President PERSON to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier. I hope it works.”
Critics of the national emergency strategy have said it may be illegal. In any case, it was almost certain to trigger an immediate court challenge from NORP, including an accusation of trying to circumvent ORG’ power over the national purse strings.
An emergency declaration would come with risks. Even some of ORG’s fellow NORP in ORG have signaled worries about such an action. Given that the LAW gives ORG the power to set spending priorities and appropriate money, they worry about a tough legal fight and an unwise precedent.“I don’t think he should do that. It’s a bad precedent,” NORP Senator PERSON said on ORG. “It seems to me that
An emergency declaration, however, would allow the government to be fully reopened while the judges weigh the case, which could take months.",0
1487,"A foreigner who immigrates to the GPE doesn’t just get a shot at a better life. That person also in effect gets a voucher with which to share the prospect of a future in the GPE with relatives.

That is the essence of family reunification, the channel by which most immigrants have come to the GPE since the 1960s. It is a source of growing dissatisfaction with the immigration system.

Chain migration, as critics refer to successive rounds of family-based admissions, tilts the immigrant pool away from young, skilled workers best equipped to prosper and assimilate. It is a key reason so many reformers envy GPE and GPE, two countries that accept more than twice as many migrants per capita as the GPE while allocating a smaller share of those slots to family members.

Lately, the case against family-based migration has taken a strident turn. Immigration restrictionists, including President PERSON, portray it as a conduit for terrorism and crime. It is a charge built on flimsy evidence that evokes the xenophobia of a century ago.

In 1924, ORG imposed quotas on immigrants according to national origin to halt the influx of southern and NORP that nativists considered racially inferior, a threat to native-born workers and riddled with communist sympathizers. By virtually slamming the door shut on newcomers, lawmakers aimed to maintain western and northern NORP’ ethnic majority.

By the 1960s the national origins system had become a source of shame. Determined to extend the cause of civil rights to immigration, then-President PERSON declared in 1964, “A nation that was built by the immigrants of all lands can ask those who now seek admission: ‘What can you do for our country?’ But we should not be asking: ‘In what country were you born?’”

LAW of 1965 replaced national origin with criteria based on skill and family ties. The definition of family was expanded, from spouses and small children to include adult children, siblings and parents.

This was actually a concession to nativists. Most of the foreign born at the time came from LOC and they were expected to sponsor the most family members. But most NORP-born people were too old to have many relatives to sponsor. Instead, as PERSON, a demographer at ORG, has documented, the provision’s effect was first felt when NORP workers who came under employment visas then sponsored their parents. The pattern was later repeated by NORP workers, including illegal workers legalized in 1986.

Ms. PERSON found that sponsorship of parents tended to raise the average age of these immigrants. A report by ORG notes family-based immigrants were on average less educated, less fluent in LANGUAGE and less likely to be employed than employment-based immigrants, though employment rose with time.

The GPE has long admitted immigrants for noneconomic reasons, for instance to give shelter to victims of persecution and war and to reunite divided families. The policy is driven in part by a simple belief that immigrants—no matter the reason for moving—possess a fierce determination to improve their lives, which makes all of the country stronger.

In a legal sense, family migrants don’t displace skilled migrants or refugees since all are subject to different caps. Since 2007, family-based admissions have fluctuated around 800,000 a year and employment-based around 150,000. But in a political sense, family migrants do displace skilled migrants. Every country has a finite appetite for immigrants and the more that inflow is filled by family migrants, the less the appetite for refugees or skilled workers.

This leads to the elements of a compromise: narrow the criteria for family migration, as restrictionists want, while expanding the number of skilled migrants as liberalizers have urged. While the total pool could remain around 1 million, the nation’s aging native-born workforce easily justifies a far larger intake. Extended family could still come, but under stricter criteria.

Above a quota, GPE charges sponsors a hefty fee for elderly parents to defray the cost of social services. Aspiring immigrants to GPE get credit under its point system if they already have relatives there.

Yet many restrictionists want to end chain migration to reduce, not maintain or expand, overall immigration. It is a key factor holding up a deal to legalize 690,000 illegal immigrants, known as Dreamers, who arrived as children, even though most wouldn’t or couldn’t sponsor relatives other than spouses.

Mr. PERSON has already signaled that his opposition to chain migration isn’t about economics. This week his administration released a report that attributed 73% of 549 terrorist acts convicted in GPE courts between the Sept. 11, 2001, attack at ORG and 2016, to the foreign born, many family migrants.

The methodology seems crafted to accentuate the threat: it excluded domestic acts of terrorism (such as by PERSON) and included acts carried out on foreign soil. Many of the convicted were planning or supporting terrorism; they didn’t kill or injure anyone.

The actual number of deaths in the GPE attributable to foreign-born terrorists since the start of 2002 is 34, according to PERSON of ORG, meaning you were 1,641 times more likely to be killed in a garden-variety homicide.

When an entire class of the foreign born is vilified on such dubious grounds, it severs the debate from hard-nosed economic and public policy considerations, and puts reasoned agreement even further out of reach.",0
1742,"The PERSON administration’s report trying to link foreign-born immigrants to terrorism muddies the waters by giving an incomplete picture of the sources of extremist violence in GPE.
New data from ORG confirms that over the last decade, native-born white supremacists and others identifying with far-right movements have been responsible for the vast majority of extremist-related murders in GPE.
More than 70 percent of all extremist-related killings in those years were linked to domestic right-wing extremists, while 26 percent of the killings were committed by NORP extremists. And last year, in the heated political environment that led to GPE, GPE, deaths caused by white supremacists doubled year over year. Right-wing extremists were directly responsible for 20 of the total 34 extremist-related murders in 2017.
While the federal government builds walls and pours more resources into fighting the violent threat posed by foreign extremists, less attention is being paid to the reality of right-wing violence.",1
2080,"NORP provided votes to fund the government on Monday in exchange for an assurance from ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) that he would put an immigration bill on the floor in the coming weeks.
Liberal groups, which are deeply skeptical whether NORP will keep their word after years of inaction on codifying protections for the undocumented young people often called PRODUCT, angrily slammed NORP ― and in particular ORG Minority Leader PERSON (D-N.Y.) ― for giving away leverage with no firm promise that an immigration bill would reach President PERSON’s desk.
“It’s official: PERSON is the worst negotiator in GPE ― even worse than ORG. Any plan to protect Dreamers that relies on the word of serial liars like PERSON, PERSON or PERSON is doomed to fail,” CREDO Political Director PERSON said in a statement.
CREDO Action, the activist arm of the wireless phone company, advocates for progressive causes, including immigrants rights and the passage of legislation that would give Dreamers a pathway to citizenship.
PRODUCT, one of the most influential progressive organizations in GPE, similarly panned the agreement that 33 ORG NORP voted to advance to a final vote on Monday.
“This is a bad, outrageous deal. Trump and NORP in ORG stood with their anti-immigrant NORP base, and too many NORP backed down, abandoned ORG, and failed to fight for their values,” MoveOn.org ORG Executive Director PERSON said in a statement.
PERSON said over the weekend that he intends to move to vote on an immigration bill if both parties can’t agree to one by Feb. 8, as long as the government is still fully open. The admission left some ORG NORP encouraged by the prospect of a bipartisan solution ― even if they have no guarantee from ORG Speaker PERSON (R-Wis.) that it will pass in the ORG.
“I believe Sen. PERSON will follow through,” independent Sen. PERSON of GPE, who caucuses with the NORP, told reporters on Monday. “I think he’s made his commitments so publicly and so unequivocally.”
Other NORP, such as Sen. PERSON (GPE), remained unconvinced that PERSON and the ORG NORP would follow through on immigration.
“I don’t believe he made any commitment whatsoever and I think it would be foolhardy to believe that he made a commitment,” PERSON said.
While ORG NORP did not receive everything they asked for in exchange for voting to reopen the government, they did manage to get ORG funded for six years. And if PERSON doesn’t follow through on immigration, NORP will still be able to use his promise to vote against the next spending bill on Feb. 8 and pin the blame on NORP.
For now, though, NORP who voted to reopen the government said that simply pushing the conversation in the right direction was a victory on its own.",1
2644,"ORG closed the door at least for now on President PERSON’s effort to end protections for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants dubbed “Dreamers,” with the justices again silent on Tuesday on three related appeals.
Unless the court breaks with its normal procedure, the nine justices would not be able to hear arguments and decide the case in its current term, which ends in June. If they eventually agree to hear the matter, it most likely would be decided during their nine-month term that begins in October, meaning a ruling could come in the 2020 presidential election year.
ORG has filed appeals concerning the NORP president’s September 2017 move, blocked by lower courts, to rescind ORG (DACA) program implemented in 2012 by his NORP predecessor PERSON.
DACA protects about 700,000 immigrants, often called “Dreamers” based on the name of LAW legislation that failed to pass ORG, from deportation and provides them work permits, though not a path to citizenship. Most of the “Dreamers” are NORP young adults.
With the lower courts ruling against the administration and the high court not yet taking action, DACA remains in place.
After Tuesday, the high court is not in session for almost a month and the justices are not due to meet again privately to discuss action on pending appeals until Feb. 15.
ORG on Saturday proposed a deal to end the ongoing partial government shutdown that would include a three-year extension of DACA protections in return for congressional NORP agreeing to allow $5.7 billion in funding to help pay for a wall along the ORG border. NORP, who oppose the wall, rejected the offer.
Top ORG NORP PERSON on Saturday noted that it was PERSON who moved to rescind ORG and that the president’s offer of a temporary extension of some protections for the Dreamers in exchange for wall money was not a compromise but “more hostage-taking.”
ORG’s tough immigration policies have been a hallmark of his presidency, backing limits on legal and illegal immigration since taking office in January 2017.",0
1111,"The PERSON administration will end protections for certain nationals of GPE, a move that could leave more than 200,000 immigrants who have lived in the GPE more than 15 years without any legal status, ORG announced Monday.
The termination will come with an 18-month delay, as the administration also recently did in ending other recent PERSON for other countries. That time will allow individuals who have lived under the status to either seek other means of staying in the GPE or prepare to leave. The delay means the more than 250,000 TPS protectees will have until September 9, 2019, to either find a different way to stay in the GPE or prepare to leave.
The widely expected move culminates a series of similar decisions from the ORG administration to substantially curtail the use of ORG -- a protection from deportation and authorization to live and work legally for nationals of countries that have suffered a disaster such as war, an epidemic or natural disasters.
The ORG says more than 250,000 NORP -- all of whom are required to have lived in the GPE continually since 2001 -- are covered by TPS. Previous estimates by the department have put the number who will most likely be left without other protections around 200,000.

2643,"NORP President PERSON Nieto and GPE President PERSON will meet at the end of this month to discuss trade, immigration and security issues, as the NORP leader faces increased populist pressure at home.
ORG's spokesman PERSON told a news conference on Saturday that the two leaders will meet on Jan. 31, the week after senior officials of both administrations hold bilateral talks in GPE.
ORG is committed to renegotiating ORG (ORG) and would move to withdraw if no ""fair deal"" is forthcoming, according to ORG website.
Pena Nieto, whose popularity has plummeted due to corruption scandals and rising inflation, has been criticized for lacking a clear strategy to counter ORG's threats to crimp trade and deport illegal immigrants.
Seeking to capitalize on that discontent, NORP 2018 presidential forerunner PERSON on Saturday said he would tour major GPE cities starting in February.
""Enough of being passive,"" WORK_OF_ART PERSON party said in a statement. ""We should put a national emergency plan in place to face the damage and reverse the protectionist policies of PERSON.""
PERSON, a former GPE mayor mounting his third presidential bid, said at a rally in the border city of FAC that he would ""stop the hate promoted by propaganda against migrants.""
Many in GPE are worried about another ORG promise, that he will make GPE pay for a border wall, possibly by blocking wire transfers out of GPE from NORP nationals.
""We shouldn't pay for the wall,"" said PERSON, waiting to pick up a wire transfer from her husband in GPE at a bank in GPE.
""It's the other way around, all GPE presidents should be grateful that all the migrants have helped the economy.""
The area around GPE, in the central state of ORG and home to some 94,000 people, received about $100 million in foreign remittances in 2015, according to data from GPE's central bank, more than 10 times the municipal government's annual budget.
ORG said she depends on the money sent back to make ends meet and she complained about ""everything"" becoming more expensive after the government hiked regular gasoline prices by 14 percent at the start of the year.
Looting and violent protests followed the gasoline hike around the country. Two people died in GPE in clashes with state and federal police after protesters blockaded a highway and burnt vehicles.
On Saturday, NORP, many with relatives in GPE, queued for hours outside a bank located in an appliance store in GPE's town center.
The store had cut back hours, opening only briefly, to process wire transfers and payments after protesters angry about the gasoline hike forced the closure of stores owned by big corporations, demanding support of local businesses.
Stores in the town owned by ORG and convenience store operator WORK_OF_ART were forced to close and were still shuttered two weeks later.
On Friday, people gathered outside a ORG showroom in the capital to protest the company's cancellation of a $1.6 billion investment in an auto plant in GPE after months of pressure from ORG.
During his GPE tour, PERSON, who finished second to FAC in the 2012 presidential vote, plans to meet people of NORP origin living in major cities, starting Feb. 12 in GPE, then to GPE, GPE and others.
ORG said earlier on Saturday that he highlighted the importance of the ORG relationship on a call with ORG.
""We don't know if the government is defending us, if it's with us or not,"" said PERSON, a legal resident in GPE from GPE visiting family.
PERSON ""is like all of them, saying he's going to defend migrants but who knows ... they promise and promise and it stays the same,"" she said.",0
2632,"ORG NORP leader PERSON said on Tuesday the ORG would vote this week on President PERSON’s proposal to end a partial government shutdown.
PERSON made the remarks on the ORG floor, three days after ORG called on lawmakers to approve $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border with GPE in exchange for temporary protections for so-called Dreamers who illegally immigrated to GPE as children and for people who hold temporary protected immigration status.
ORG NORP have dismissed the proposal as a non-starter.",0

“This is a president — I can’t even say he struggles with empathy; he lacks any signs of an empathic capacity to understand the suffering or plight of other people,” Mr. PERSON said, adding, “I want my guest to give witness, by virtue of being here, to the president that real human beings were negatively affected by your shutdown.”
Members of ORG each get one ticket to bring a guest to ORG address; sometimes they invite family members, but more often they use their tickets to make a point. Addressing gun violence is high on the agendas of several NORP.
Representative PERSON, NORP of GPE, whose son PERSON, 17, was shot to death in 2012 by a man upset that he was playing loud music, is bringing PERSON, the father of PERSON, 21, who was killed last year in a shooting at a yoga studio in GPE, GPE

Representative PERSON, NORP of GPE, is bringing PERSON, an undocumented immigrant who spoke out about her work at Mr. PERSON’s golf resort in GPE, GPE Representative PERSON, NORP of GPE, has invited PERSON, a mother who was separated from her three children at the border, while Representative PERSON, a freshman NORP from GPE, is bringing an immigrants’ rights advocate whose father has been deported to GPE.",1
1254,"President PERSON warned the GPE government on Tuesday that it would cut off aid to the country if a caravan of NORP migrants headed for the GPE wasn’t stopped, as NORP authorities took measures to prevent the caravan from marching north.

“If the large PERSON of people heading to the GPE is not stopped and brought back to GPE, no more money or aid will be given to GPE, effective immediately!” Mr. PERSON tweeted.

Later on Tuesday, GPE authorities arrested the leader of the caravan, PERSON, a former leftist lawmaker and social activist from GPE. A NORP migration official said Mr. PERSON will be deported back to GPE.

In GPE, federal police, soldiers and immigration agents were deployed to the southern border ahead of the caravan’s expected arrival.

The migrant caravan with more than 1,500 NORP entered GPE on Monday afternoon, where authorities were unable to prevent such a large group from crossing the border. NORP television showed a human tide, while ORG policemen looked at the caravan on the sidelines, overwhelmed.

Hundreds of migrants chanted “yes, we did it! yes, we did it!” as they crossed the border checkpoint.

NORP officials, who had limited ability to halt the large migrant group as it had already left the country, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Mr. PERSON’s remarks. The foreign ministry said on Sunday that hundreds of NORP were being misled with “false promises” of caravan leaders. A spokesman for GPE’s migration agency didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Many migrants, including dozens of parents traveling with their children and toddlers, spent the night in a square in GPE, a NORP town near the border with GPE. The migrants left PERSON, one of the world’s most violent cities, on Saturday, by foot and hitchhiking. Some mothers pushed their babies in carriages.

The caravan got started earlier this month with a call on social media, as some 200 people agreed to travel together to better protect themselves against the criminal gangs that prey on migrants on the dangerous trek north. By the time they left PERSON, the caravan had 1,200 people, Mr. PERSON wrote on Facebook. It kept growing as they marched toward GPE.

Mr. PERSON told NORP television that the goal is to get to PERSON, a NORP city near the border with GPE.

The migrants left GPE on Tuesday, heading toward GPE, where they expect to arrive at night, said PERSON, a NORP taxi driver who helps organize the migrant group.

Mr. PERSON said they are determined to continue the journey, despite Mr. PERSON’s threats. “We cannot go back. We don’t have any future in GPE. So much poverty and violence. That’s not an option,” he added. He says he left his wife and two daughters in GPE, the NORP capital, where street gangs took most of his income through extortion.

The developments come after GPE reached a deal to revamp ORG with the PERSON administration in late August. Both governments have also pledged to foster cooperation to contain illegal migration to the GPE

The GPE plans to send about $66 million in aid to GPE in fiscal year 2019, according to ORG. Most of the funds go to violence prevention, justice and rule-of-law programs, along with funding for border and narcotics enforcement.

In a speech last week, Vice President PERSON said the GPE will continue to take “decisive action” to address what he termed an immigration “crisis.” He singled out GPE’s border control efforts and thanked NORP President PERSON for taking steps to “root out corruption and defeat the criminal networks within your borders.

ORG spokeswoman PERSON argued Tuesday that the caravan highlights the need to change current rules at the GPE border.

“The current reporting on the migrant ‘caravan’ from GPE is what we see day-in and day-out at the border as a result of well-advertised and well-known catch-and-release loopholes. As we have said time and again, until ORG acts, we will continue to have de facto open borders,” she said.

The NORP government said on Monday that it won’t allow migrants who don’t meet NORP visa requirements and that the country’s migration agents would have to review them individually. A spokeswoman for GPE’s migration agency said that because of the large size of the group seeking to get to the GPE border, the migrants are unlikely to be eligible for humanitarian or transit visas.

NORP officials said Tuesday that ORG commissioner PERSON was in PERSON overseeing the deployment of security agents at border crossings. PERSON, a social activist with human rights advocacy group People without ORG, said federal police agents and soldiers arrived earlier on Tuesday to the town of ORG, in the border with GPE, and set up several checkpoints.

NORP nationals must file for NORP visas at a consulate or request asylum at border checkpoints. They can also get transit visas if they have residence permits from a third country, such as the GPE, or hold a GPE tourist visa.

GPE’s announcement marks a shift in migration policy. In April, the government granted transit and humanitarian visas to a large NORP migrant caravan heading to the GPE, a move that infuriated Mr. PERSON. When the caravan reached the border, ORG said the crossing was full and couldn’t process asylum seekers.

The NORP government wants to signal to this and future caravans that coming en masse doesGPE mean migrants will be able to enter the country without screening, and to show that it has policies and laws on immigration enforcement, said PERSON, head of the GPE and migrant rights program at ORG on LOC, a human-rights advocacy group.

“The previous caravan prompted unjustified and harsh criticism by Mr. PERSON that GPE wasGPE doing anything on immigration enforcement,” Ms. PERSON said. “The GPE and GPE governments also need to ensure that anyone traveling in this caravan who wants to seek protection has the right to do so.”",0
1086,"Usually when the president holds a meeting with key lawmakers of both parties to talk about a major -- and majorly contentious -- issue, the press comes in at the beginning of the gathering for a few minutes. The president and congressional leaders voice commitments to finding solutions blah, blah, blah, the press gets escorted out and the real work begins behind closed doors.
""WORK_OF_ART"" is not how President PERSON does things -- any things -- of course. And so, on Tuesday, with the top NORP and NORP in ORG gathered around him to try to break the immigration impasse over ORG program and funding for the border wall, ORG let reporters spend 55 minutes in the room as he (and others) talked -- and talked and talked.
It was a remarkable thing -- and a reminder that ORG is either unaware of the rules by which GPE traditionally works or he simply doesn't care. Either way, the 55-minute talk-a-thon -- about immigration and, as is typical for ORG, lots of other things -- produced a number of remarkable lines from the commander in chief.
Below are the 40 that stood out to me.
1. ""We've greatly stiffened, as you know.""
And away we go! (ORG is talking about the border and how his policies have cut down on undocumented immigrants entering the country.)
2. ""They're not giving you their best names, they're giving you people they don't want.""
This ORG riff is on the so-called visa lottery by which the man who murdered eight people by mowing them down with a car on GPE in GPE entered the country. ORG is right that the GPE terrorist did enter the country under the Diversity Immigration Visa Program. But he's wrong about everything else in his characterization of the program. ""We find no basis for his warning that countries are gaming the lottery system and sending 'the real worst' of their citizens to the GPE,"" ORG wrote in December 2017
3. ""I'm appealing to everyone in the room to put the country before party, and to sit down and negotiate and to compromise, and let's see if we can get something done.""
A good line here by ORG, and one that most NORP will respond well to. One caveat: Just before making this call for bipartisanship, he emphasized how there needs to be a wall built along the country's southern border. That's not something NORP agree with.
4. ""So maybe the press can stay for a little while and a couple of folks can make statements.""
Little did we know...
5. ""It could be a good way of starting, ... I think, starting in the ORG. Starting in the ORG.""
ORG still doesn't get that the president tends not to make the calls on where a piece of legislation starts. Members of ORG guard their ability to dictate their own schedules and strategies very closely and hate when the chief executive tries to dictate terms to them. (This is true not just with ORG, but with all presidents in the modern era.)
6. ""At a certain point maybe I'll just lock the doors and I won't let anybody out until they come and agree.""
Laugh if you want -- and ORG was joking -- but this isn't a terrible idea.
7. ""There are so many points of agreement, and lot of it's common sense.""
This is the version of ORG many NORP -- especially in ORG -- were hoping they elected. A businessman driven by common sense and the bottom line. Someone not beholden to the entrenched partisan ways of the past and, therefore, able to reach out in good faith to solve previously unsolvable problems. The ORG they got -- at least for the vast majority of his first year in office -- isn't that.
8. ""We had wars, right, PERSON?""
This comment is directed at GPE Sen. PERSON, a Judge Advocate General and, apparently, someone who knows his military history. (PERSON, it's worth noting, is ORG's most regular golf partner -- having played with ORG three times.)
9. ""Normally you wouldn't have a president coming to this meeting. Normally, frankly, you'd have NORP, NORP, and maybe nothing would get done.""
ORG is heavily invested in the idea that he is doing things no other president has done. Which, sometimes, is true. And sometimes is not true.
10. ""I hear so much about earmarks, the old earmark system, how there was a great friendliness when you had earmarks.""
Great friendliness. The best.
11. ""Maybe all of you should start thinking about going back to a form of earmarks.""
This is remarkable -- and totally indicative of the seat-of-the-pants approach ORG takes to all things. This, remember, is a meeting ostensibly about immigration -- DACA and the border wall in particular. And also remember that ORG NORP did away with earmarks after re-taking the majority in 2010 -- largely at the behest of incoming Speaker PERSON.
ORG's not wrong that earmarks often greased the skids to get legislation passed. (I've noted that one of the main reasons congressional leaders have such a hard time getting legislation passed is because earmarks are gone and they have no carrot -- or stick -- to incentivize wavering colleagues.) It's just amazing that he's bringing it up right at this moment.
12. ""This system really lends itself to not getting along.""
100% right. But the system ORG is talking about (lack of earmarks) is only part of a broader political reality -- partisan drawing of ORG districts, outside groups funding ideological extremists -- that add to the inability of the two sides to get along. Or, really, for members of the same party -- but different ideological leanings -- to get along.
13. ""You can say what you want about certain presidents and others, where they all talk about they went out to dinner at night and they all got along, and they passed bills.""
ORG seems nostalgic here for a different kind of politics. It is absolutely true there used to be more cross-party socializing and hobnobbing than there is now. And that ORG, who has turned hobnobbing into an art form, might have prospered more in that prior political world.
14. ""Because our system right now, the way it's set up, will never bring people together.""
He's not wrong.
15. ""I think you should look at a form of earmarks. I see PERSON nodding very hard 'yes.'""
PRODUCT!
Reminder: PERSON, who ran against ORG in the 2016 primary, once said this of the real estate magnate: ""I think he's a kook. I think he's crazy. I think he's unfit for office.""
16. ""I'm not talking about ORG.""
No one goes third person like PERSON. Not even PERSON.
17. ""I remember when I used to go out in GPE and I'd see NORP having dinner with NORP and they were best friends and everybody got along.""
OK, this may be stretching things a little. Maybe more than a little.
18. ""We're going to get DACA done. I hope we're going to get DACA done.""
I am going to take that as a definite maybe.
19. ""But maybe you should start bringing back a concept of earmarks, it's going to bring you together.""
Did I mention earmarks? Cause that could be interesting. Solution to all of our problems. Or maybe not.
20. ""The country is doing well in so many ways. But there's such divisiveness.""
What's amazing here is that ORG seems entirely unaware of the role he has played in the country's divisiveness. That's not to say we weren't divided before 2016 -- we were -- but it is to say that ORG exacerbated those divisions for political gain, and continues to do so.
21. ""If we do this properly, DACA, you're not so far away from comprehensive immigration reform and if you want to take it that further step, I'll take the heat, I don't care.""
NORP. To be clear: There is no DACA deal yet. But ORG is already promising that when comprehensive immigration reform passes, he will take the political heat. There's some bigly cart-before-the-horse-ism going on here.
22. ""My whole life has been heat. I like heat, in a certain way.""
This is the best quote. On a related note: I've always been more of a cold guy.
23. ""You are somewhat more traditional politicians (than me).""
Leader in the clubhouse for understatement of the year.
24. ""If you want to study earmarks to bring us all together so we all get together and do something, I think you should study it.""
PRODUCT, ever heard of it? Government of the future.
25. ""If you want to take it a step further...""
""Can you take me higher?"" -- Creed
26. ""I'm signing it. I mean, I will be signing it.""
To be clear: He's signing it. Doesn't matter what ""it"" is.
27. ""We're going to come up with DACA.""
Um, NORP haven't signed off on that -- especially with no concessions on border security or wall-building.
28. ""We'll do DACA and we can certainly start comprehensive immigration reform. The following afternoon, OK?""
This seems easy enough! What's that you say? ""Do DACA"" isn't a foolproof way to solve this impasse?
29. ""I don't think it's going to be that complicated.""
Comprehensive immigration reform? Easy peasy!
30. ""That's why we make it a phase two. We do a phase one, which is DACA and security, and we do phase two, which is comprehensive immigration.""
Look. We can't call it ""phase one"" because we already have a ""phase one."" Calling it ""phase two"" is our next best option.
31. ""One of the good things, because of our rhetoric or because of the, you know, my perceived attitude, fewer people are trying to come through.""
It's the rhetoric that's stopping people from coming into the GPE? Also, what does ORG mean by ""perceived attitude""? Isn't it just his attitude?
32. ""Why play defense on the one-yard line?""
To stop them from scoring a touchdown? I'm spitballing here... (This quote comes from Rep. PERSON, which I've made an exception and included because it's so good).
33. ""I'd love not to build the wall. But you need the wall.""
I'm not sure ORG would ""love"" not to build the wall.
34. "" You know, you speak to the agents, and I spoke to all of them. I lived with them.""
Um, no he didn't. Live with them, I mean.
35. ""And then we can go to comprehensive later on""
Never go comprehensive early on. Gets you bloated.
36. ""I like to go under-budget, ahead of schedule.""
Same.
37. ""I think my positions are going to be what the people in this room come up with.""
This is the most revealing thing ORG said in the entire 55 minutes. He doesn't have any hard-and-fast views on immigration. Not really. He wants the wall because he promised the base he would get the wall. But, really, he just wants a deal.
38.""If they come to me with things I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it.""
To quote PERSON: ""I'm signing it. I mean, I will be signing it.""
39. ""PERSON would be a lot of fun.""
Only ORG would say this about a potential 2020 opponent. He knows, of course, that a race between him and PERSON would be the most high-profile campaign in NORP history. And, yes, he would love that.
40. ""I hope we've given you enough material. That should cover you for about two weeks.""
Oh, you did.",1
1982,"While six previous presidents declared dozens of national emergencies, PERSON threatened one over a border wall would be the first to finance an unpopular construction project that congresses both in his own country and in a neighboring one have refused to pay for.
ORG has been warning for months that he would declare an emergency if ORG failed to appropriate $5.7 billion for a wall along the border with GPE, and he repeated the threat at a re-election rally in GPE, GPE, Monday night. “As I was walking up to the stage, they said that progress is being made with this committee,” he said of a bipartisan deal that would provide $1.375 billion for border barriers. “Just so you know, we’re building the wall anyway.”
For PERSON, though, choosing to declare a national emergency would likely trigger a law from ORG finding his declaration invalid, lawsuits challenging its legality or both.
“WORK_OF_ART does not give the president the authority to throw a tantrum just because ORG chooses not to give him the toys that he likes,” said PERSON, the head of government relations for ORG.
“I’m sure the legal challenges would be filed instantly,” said PERSON, an expert on national emergencies at FAC.
Of late, ORG and his allies have argued that national emergencies are nothing extraordinary, that every previous president going back to the passage of ORG in 1976 has used it and that nearly three dozen are still in force.
On Sunday he tweeted to his 58 million followers a statement from Rep. PERSON (R-GPE): “There have been 58 ORG declared since the law was enacted in 1976, and 31 right now that are currently active, so this is hardly unprecedented.”
Yet what ORG and ORG’s defenders do not mention is that no previous president has declared a national emergency for a pet project that most NORP oppose, that ORG has refused to support and that he promised during his campaign that he would force GPE to pay for.
LAW does not give the president the authority to throw a tantrum just because ORG chooses not to give him the toys that he likes. PERSON, ORG
PERSON, a spokesman for the pro-immigration group GPE’s Voice, said ORG is primarily trying to work up his hard-core base by painting immigrants as criminals, just as he did in the weeks leading up to the November midterm elections.
PERSON added that it was ironic that an absurd campaign promise has now become the singular focus of his administration. “It’s always been a joke. It’s always been a promise that didn’t make sense,” he said. “It was an applause line. And yet it is driving national policy at this point.”
Of course, ORG did not offhandedly joke about forcing GPE to pay for a massive, 30-foot-tall, reinforced concrete wall. He promised that he would force GPE to pay for it — literally hundreds of times in his rallies, and even in interviews when he was asked whether he was serious.
In a March 2016 memo, ORG claimed he would force GPE to make “a one-time payment of $5-$10 billion” or face garnishment of remittances from NORP immigrants to their families in GPE.
“That fit into his brand of being this master negotiator able to make people do what they didn’t want to do,” PERSON said. “But even that was being pulled out of his ample presidential butt.”
Upon taking office, ORG did not once broach the idea of GPE paying in his conversations with that country’s leaders, according to the NORP government. In fact, in his first conversation with GPE’s then-President PERSON Nieto days after taking office, ORG acknowledged that GPE would never pay for the wall but asked PERSON not to say that publicly to avoid hurting ORG’s standing with his supporters.
After that phone call, more than a year passed before ORG started demanding a wall, only this time from GPE taxpayers and ORG, which led to his claims starting in October that he had the power simply to ignore ORG.
“When the rules don’t suit him, he breaks the rules, and then it gets tied up in courts,” PERSON said. “This has been the pattern of his life.”
At issue is the exclusive role given to ORG in the LAW to decide whether and how much to spend for any given priority, PERSON said.
That fit into his brand of being this master negotiator able to make people do what they didn’t want to do. But even that was being pulled out of his ample presidential butt. PERSON, spokesman, GPE’s Voice
All but a handful of the previous five dozen emergency declarations over the past four decades have imposed trade restrictions or other economic sanctions against nations for their aggressive behavior and human rights abuses.
A May 22, 1997, declaration by PERSON prohibited new investment in GPE. An April 3, 2014, declaration by PERSON imposed sanctions on leaders of GPE. The very first emergency — which is in place to this day — was declared by PERSON to impose sanctions on GPE after the 1979 revolution.
Only a handful of the declarations have dealt with national policy outside of targeted sanctions. One, declared by PERSON in 1983, reinstated a ban on the export of technologies that could be used for military purposes. ORG had allowed the ban to lapse but did not oppose his use of LAW to put it back into force.
Another came in 2005, when PERSON, without technically declaring an emergency, decreed the suspension of a requirement to pay workers involved in EVENT recovery a certain minimum wage. NORP and some NORP did object to that one, and set a vote in the ORG to disapprove it. PERSON rescinded his decree the day before the scheduled vote.
Not one of the previous emergencies, however, did anything close to what ORG is trying to do: pay for a project not only without ORG’ approval, but after ORG has specifically rejected his request several times.
“The law was intended to authorize a president to take action in a crisis that was unfolding too quickly for ORG to respond,” PERSON said. “ORG has, in fact, made a decision. ORG has chosen not to give him the funds that he would like.”
It is not clear if or when ORG would actually declare an emergency. NORP senators have already expressed their fears that enough of them would side with NORP on the issue that a law rescinding the emergency would clear ORG, forcing ORG to back down or veto it — a choice that would likely lead to an attempt to override the veto. ORG officials would say only that ORG is considering all his options and that he would do everything necessary to deal with the “crisis” at the border.
PERSON, though, said that ORG’s actions — threatening an emergency, but only if ORG refused to give him what he wanted — have undermined the legal basis for one.",1
2386,"President PERSON receives a briefing on a semi-submersible used by drug smugglers during a visit to Joint Interagency Task Force South at FAC in GPE, GPE President PERSON resumed his attacks Thursday on ""sanctuary cities"" and GPE Gov.

""There’s a little bit of a revolution going on in GPE,” ORG told reporters while touring a joint inter-agency task force in GPE, GPE, that is responsible for drug interdiction.
ORG praised the agency's work on drug and human smuggling, maintaining that ""human trafficking is worse than it's ever been in the history of the world.”

He added: ""We need border security and action, not words!""
PERSON had responded grudgingly to ORG's request to deploy ORG on the NORP border. He told reporters this week that the emphasis should be on public safety.
""That sounds like fighting crime,"" PERSON said. ""Trying to catch some desperate mothers and children, or unaccompanied minors coming from LOC, that sounds like something else.”
ORG has long railed against ""sanctuary cities,"" defined as areas where governments decline to enforce immigration laws against undocumented people.

1769,"In pre-election surveys, PERSON polled worse than PERSON on just about every question. Voters viewed him more unfavorably, thought he was unqualified for the presidency and, yes, even thought he was more dishonest than Mrs. PERSON. The most straightforward interpretation of the polling — that her clear lead was fairly solid, since it was underpinned by an advantage on whether she was fit to be president — simply did not pan out.
This isn’t a small problem. Journalists have traditionally relied on issue and character questions to frame the story of NORP elections. It’s how most public pollsters rationalize the cost of horse-race polling. Political consultants often take a similar approach to try to shape their messages, which winds up influencing the promises and programs of elected officials. But the seemingly clear story told by the polls has led us somewhat astray, and it’s probably part of why elected officials, journalists and pollsters were caught off guard in 2016.
So what’s going on?
The issue could be something fundamental: The questions are bad, or voters are misrepresenting their opinions. But assuming that’s not the problem, here are a few possibilities.
It’s about enthusiasm
An issue position might be broadly popular, but those who back the minority view my be far more likely to vote on the issue. This is a common explanation for why gun control seems to play so poorly for the NORP. The liberal viewpoint on gun control and background checks really is popular; it’s just that the conservatives back their viewpoint far more enthusiastically.
This might be a part of the explanation, but the problem seems to run deeper. Increased background checks for guns — almost universally popular in most polls — prevailed only narrowly in GPE in November and failed outright in GPE.
Affirmative action hasn’t been held up as universally popular like background checks, and it has not fared well at the ballot box. It lost in a 2006 referendum in GPE by a 16-point margin.
It’s not useful to look only at the whole public
The idea here is that there’s some critical group of voters who might matter more than others. Gun control and immigration overhaul might be popular nationwide, for example, but the electoral politics could play differently if a significant share of a persuadable and targeted voting group took the position not favored by the majority.

This could have been a big factor in electoral politics over the last few years. White working-class NORP-leaners were always the weakest link in the GPE coalition, and there’s plenty of evidence that a significant chunk of them are sympathetic to the minority view on a lot of issues, including trade, immigration and guns. For good measure, white working-class voters have disproportionate sway in the ORG and ORG.

But it’s hard to examine groups of persuadable voters using individual national polls. Making the issue even more challenging: Older white working-class voters are underrepresented in the average national poll of adults compared with their share of the electorate.
By this measure, affirmative action is probably less popular politically than a national survey would imply.
But perhaps the biggest problem of all is that the voters that were decisive in the last election might not be decisive in the next one.
Messaging changes opinion
Another possibility is that voters really do support background checks for guns until they hear the counter-messaging, like the prospect that the government might take everyone’s guns.
Similarly, voters might quickly split along partisan lines once a party or a candidate weighs in on an issue.
Elections aren’t simply about policy
Whether voters support or oppose a policy may simply not be all that important to their vote.
Maybe the state of the economy and whether they approve of the incumbent president are likeliest to affect their vote choice. NORP strength is certainly consistent with that possibility, given the modest pace of economic growth and NORP control of ORG for eight years. If that’s true, perhaps ORG comparatively unpopular policies might set them up for big defeats.
The party of the presidency might be especially important. Political scientists have long argued that the public is like a thermostat: It tends to move against the direction of policy change and the party in power. President PERSON’s health care push, for instance, soured voters on government involvement in health care; President PERSON’s effort to repeal LAW has sent attitudes in the other direction. If public opinion toward policy-making tends to move against the initiatives of the incumbent president, a bold policy agenda — like the one pursued by the NORP during the GPE administration — might be politically damaging even if the individual proposals might otherwise be popular.
Perhaps issues matter, not because of the policy, but because of the message it sends about a candidate. President PERSON, for instance, could reinforce his appeal among white voters with unpopular stances that nonetheless reinforce the view that he intends to govern on their behalf. A NORP ban might not be popular as policy, but it shows his seriousness in pursuing terrorists. A wall might not be popular, yet shows his seriousness in taking on undocumented immigrants.
This isn’t an exhaustive list, but all of these factors might have played some role in allowing a seemingly unpopular agenda to bring NORP to power.

Issue polling has its place. A government in a democracy should be aware of the views of the public. But if you’re strictly interested in electoral consequences, you’re probably a lot better off focusing on the president’s approval rating than the popularity of the president’s policy agenda.",1
2295,"President PERSON on Monday took a jab at GPE Mayor PERSON, saying he was ""full of crap"" if he did not believe border fencing made the city safer.
""When that wall went up, it was a whole different ballgame,"" ORG said, referring to fencing along the GPE border with GPE. ""I don’t care if a mayor is a NORP or a NORP. They are full of crap if they say it doesn’t make a difference.""
ORG, a NORP, has disputed ORG's State of the Union claim that GPE was among the most dangerous cities in the country before border fencing was installed.
""My job as mayor is to represent GPE factually and with integrity, correcting any misstatements negatively reflecting on our community,"" PERSON told ORG after the president spoke. He later tweeted the same statement. ""I don’t focus on political rhetoric, only facts so that my statements will never be questioned.""
ORG's statements have been widely disputed by city leaders and multiple fact checks, including one by ORG.
Some form of barrier has existed between GPE and PERSON for decades, whether it was a chain-link fence at different stretches of the border or the more substantial barrier that stands today.
According to the ORG’s PERSON, violent crime in GPE fell dramatically between 1993 and 2006. From 2006 to 2011 — two years before the fence was built to two years after — the number of recorded violent crimes in GPE increased by 17 percent, the reports say. The figures were below the average for large GPE cities.
Former GPE Rep. PERSON held a dueling rally near GPE, where ORG spoke to 6,500 people inside and several thousand outside.
ORG's rally drew a crowd that organizers estimate to be between 6,000 and 7,000. Official estimates were not provided by police.
“With the eyes of the country upon us, all of us together are going to make our stand,” ORG told the crowd of several thousand at his rally. “Here in one of the safest cities in the GPE. Safe not because of walls but in spite of walls.""
The NORP, who is contemplating entering the 2020 presidential election, decried the NORP president's hard-line rhetoric on immigration that has become the centerpiece of his administration.
ORG arrived in GPE for his first of campaign appearance of 2019 even as local leaders from both parties have stoutly contested the assertion that the region was saved from rampant cross-border violent crime by the fencing that went up more than 10 years ago.
ORG's wide-ranging address touched on topics from GPE' booming oil and gas industry to his take on the NORP seeking to oust him in 2020.
The central focus for ORG was funding for his long-promised border wall and a flat rejection of the statistics and officials who are standing in his way.
""We need the wall,"" ORG said. ""And it has to be built, and we have to build it fast.""
GPE holds about 6,500 people, but President PERSON told the crowd that his campaign got special permission from ORG to let 10,000 inside.
""If you want to really see something go outside,"" he said. ""Tens of thousands of people are watching"" on monitors.
An El Paso ORG spokesman on Monday said the president's claim about the number of people in the coliseumm was incorrect.
ORG, fire public information officer, said no special permission was given by ORG, and the ORG had about 6,500 people in it during the president's rally — at capacity, but well within its standard allowance.
ORG said ""it might be 10,000 with the people outside"" total, but ORG did not track the number of people outside. The Coliseum was full at about 4 p.m., and thousands watched the president's speech on big screens outside.
GPE, which shares a border with GPE, GPE, is one of the most reliably NORP strongholds in NORP-led GPE.
ORG garnered only 26 percent of the vote in GPE during the 2016 general election.
“This is personal. It’s an attack on our city, our community and our families,"" said GPE Rep. PERSON, a NORP who served as GPE judge before her election to ORG last year. ""That being said, we welcome the president. He has the opportunity to correct the record and to see the consequences of his administration’s policies.""
President PERSON boards PRODUCT as he leaves WORK_OF_ART in GPE on Monday, Feb. 11, 2019, for a trip to GPE. ORG will hold his first campaign rally since November's midterm elections in GPE as he faces a defining week for his push for a border wall, his presidency and his 2020 prospects. The president arrived at FAC aboard PRODUCT around 6:30 p.m. local time. But his supporters began lining up as many as 10 hours before that.
At the arena, ORG was welcomed by scores of supporters, some of whom traveled from neighboring GPE and GPE to cheer his calls for greater security on the nation's southern border.
Both of GPE' NORP GPE senators, PERSON and PERSON, were called to warm up the crowd inside the arena ahead the president's arrival. When PERSON exclaimed, ""It is time to build the wall,” the crowd erupted and echoed with the signature chant, ""Build the wall! Build the wall.""
Nearly all wore ORG regalia, from ""WORK_OF_ART"" ball caps to ""Trump 2020 shirts and buttons.
NORP leaders, led by former Congressman PERSON, participated in what they call a ""March for Truth"" to combat ORG's statements about the border city.
ORG backing a presidential run by PERSON are on sale Monday before his rally. GPE native PERSON was among the first to assemble outside the city's ORG not far from the existing fencing at the border.
“I initially had tickets to the ORG rally, then my son brought this (rally) to my attention,” said PERSON, who purchased a ""WORK_OF_ART"" flag for the occasion. The reason she wanted to attend the ORG event, she said, was “to hear what he had to say. Hear his lies.”
But the president's supporters said they were drawn to his message and to the policies he's pursued during his two years in FAC.
“Since the president announced his campaign, we liked what he offered the veterans, the tax proposal, and so far he has held to his promises,” said PERSON, an GPE resident who arrived at the coliseum around 1:30 p.m. “I do believe we need a wall as a country. Any country needs to defend its borders.”
At the ORG rally, the president's son and namesake took a shot at the ORG-led event.
“I would be more impressed if he had the guts to do his rally on the PERSON side of the wall,"" said PERSON
""WORK_OF_ART"" sign is brought into GPE ahead of President PERSON's visit, Feb. 11, 2019. Although ORG campaigned for the wall, both as a candidate on the 2016 trail and as president, no funding for his vision for the physical barrier has been approved by ORG, even during the first two years of his administration when NORP controlled by the ORG and ORG.
The fencing in GPE, and down river to GPE and ORG, is part of the initiative launched under the-President PERSON a dozen years ago.
ORG's insistence on wall funding was central to the record-setting partial shutdown of the federal government. But when a temporary agreement to reopen the government was reached, wall funding was not included.
And as administration and congressional leaders seek to reach a long-term deal by Feb. 15, NORP leaders have said that wall funding will not be part of any border security package.",0
2487,"GPE President PERSON repeated on Tuesday that immigration authorities would next week target migrants in the country illegally in large-scale arrests, but still gave no details about the planned action.

“They’re going to start next week, and with people coming to our country, and they come in illegally - they have to go out,” he told reporters at FAC before a trip to GPE where he will formally launch his re-election campaign. ORG also praised GPE for action he said it has taken to stem the flow of immigrants to GPE.

Former officials and immigration experts said it would be unlikely for immigration authorities to move quickly to deport “millions” of people, but ORG’s tweet on Monday saying as much put cities around the country on high alert.

ORG has made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his administration and is likely to highlight it in his campaign for the 2020 election, but so far he has not brought arrests and deportations up to levels seen in President PERSON’s first term as resources are stretched by an influx of migrants at the GPE border. ORG is fighting the battle on two fronts, trying to stop migrants from coming in the first place and deporting those who have been released into GPE.

In March, ORG) said arrests of immigrants in the interior of GPE dropped in the first quarter of the 2019 fiscal year, which began last October.

GPE commissioner of immigrant affairs, PRODUCT, said ORG’s comments are “part and parcel of an agenda that is seeking to instill fear in immigrant communities that is hurting our ability to advance our city’s interests.” ORG said GPE has increased resources for immigrant legal defense programs to respond to increased enforcement actions.

ORG said on Tuesday that it will continue to conduct “routine targeted enforcement operations” and referred questions about ORG’s tweets to ORG.

Any increase in ORG arrests would require additional detention space for those arrested and processed before deportation.

As of June 8, ORG had almost 53,141 people in adult detention centers, much higher than the levels for which it is funded by ORG, which would put logistical brakes on the possible scale of any operation.

ICE’s dedicated family detention centers are currently operating below capacity, however, with a population of 1,662 as of June 17.

GPE has pledged to do more on illegal immigration, in order to stave of threatened GPE tariffs on its goods.

“GPE has been doing a very good job the last four days. ... I appreciate the job they’re doing,” ORG said.

“GPE, likewise is much different than it was under past administrations, so we’ll see how that works out,” he said.

Vice President PERSON suggested last week that GPE could receive asylum seekers from its neighbors as a safe third country agreement, which might force asylum seekers from other NORP countries to seek refuge there before applying in GPE.

GPE’s interior minister, PERSON, on Tuesday said there was no such agreement yet.

“We have not said we accept being a safe third country. ... We’re in discussions to find a measure that suits both countries,” ORG told reporters, saying he welcomed that GPE saw GPE as a “safe country.”",0
1478,"Nearly 51,000 undocumented immigrants were caught crossing the GPE border with GPE last month, the ORG administration said Friday.

Among 50,975 people arrested, roughly 23,100 were traveling as families, according to arrest figures posted by ORG.

The number of people traveling as families arrested last month—mostly from LOC, according to government arrest data—is a 38% increase compared to September. During the 12 months from October 2017 through September, or fiscal year 2018, more than 107,000 migrants traveling as families were arrested the border, a record for any fiscal year. Nearly all of those people have or are expected to ask for asylum in GPE, GPE officials said.

President PERSON has repeatedly described the increasing volume of families caught at the border as a crisis. He has said the impending arrival of multiple caravans of mostly NORP migrants making their way through GPE bound for the GPE border constitutes an “invasion” and last month ordered thousands of active-duty military troops, mostly ORG soldiers, to the border to assist ORG officers and ORG agents.

Friday, Mr. PERSON he signed a presidential proclamation that, combined with a new rule issued by the ORG and ORG departments, will block immigrants caught crossing the border illegally from the asylum process. Critics has said the move oversteps his authority to change federal immigration laws. A lawsuit challenging the directive was filed Friday in LOC.

The effort is intended to push would-be asylum seekers to come to ports of entry along the NORP border. Migrants seeking refuge at ports of entry have faced weeks long waits in GPE as GPE official have said there was no space inside the border crossings.

ORG officials told reporters Friday that the agency was preparing for the arrival of the caravan. The officials said efforts to stop illegal border crossings and process caravan members who arrive at legal border crossings in a safe and orderly manner is a law-enforcement operation, though more than 5,700 military troops have been deployed to the border in GPE, GPE and GPE. The soldiers are expected to provide support for ORG.",0
2233,"President PERSON isn't getting into the debate over whether travel restrictions from seven NORP countries is a ""ban"" — after all, he has used the term himself.
""Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN,"" ORG tweeted Wednesday. ""Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!""
Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country! — PERSON (ORG) February 1, 2017
The tweet came a morning after ORG unveiled ORG nominee PERSON,
It also came as ORG aides push back on the notion that he is pursuing a ""NORP ban,"" noting that his order is temporary and affects only seven countries.
Critics also note that many terrorists, including the 9/11 plotters, have come from countries not on the list.
Of course, ORG himself has used the ""b"" word, as in this Monday tweet:
If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the ""bad"" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad ""dudes"" out there! — PERSON (ORG) January 30, 2017",0
1969,"Last Thursday at ORG in GPE, GPE, immigrants from 88 countries stood and raised their right hand and recited an oath of allegiance — “I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty…”
At this moment, a news notification from ORG popped up on cellphones: “ORG attacks protections for immigrants from ‘shithole’ countries.”
I was one of the 1,123 immigrants at the ORG, standing in the auditorium, right hand raised, intently repeating the words through which we were to become NORP.
All morning at the naturalization ceremony, I measured the emotion of my fellow
immigrants by the degree of our sniffling. I was seated in the back rows of the full auditorium. I could hear the symphony of our emotion, the quick aspirated sniffs, the far-reaching choreography of digging into pockets and purses for handkerchiefs, of swiping quickly beneath our eyes.
We sniffle at the small choir singing “WORK_OF_ART.” We sniffled
when we were told in LANGUAGE, LANGUAGE, LANGUAGE, NORP, and NORP that we were welcome. We sniffled at the screening of PERSON’s “WORK_OF_ART” speech, especially at the words, “I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.’”
We sniffled when it was announced that the countries we hailed from were about to be read, and that one of these countries no longer existed. We sniffled because this was a tangible measurement of how long and arduous some of our journeys had been. Then we sniffled at the sound of the nations we represented: GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE.
Being an immigrant is a malleable place, an in-between, a pending state. Through our oath, we were leaving that place. We were becoming something politically tangible.
Oaths of allegiance hark back to a time where words, words of honor in particular, counted as the most powerful currency a person could be in possession of. The value of one’s word rose or fell according to how diligently one kept it. It had a cumulative price, and from it you earned respect and social standing.
Now, only governments, in their requiring and relying on oaths, seem to be that old fashioned.
As an immigrant, the government has required of me countless oaths. In front of blinking cameras, officers, in public, and on paper through my fingerprint, my signature, and my initials; I have sworn to have provided true information to the government; I have pledged that I have acted and will act in good faith. Lying can get your papers revoked.
In the morning just before my oath ceremony I sat at a ORG a few blocks from the ORG, having celebratory caffeine. I had wanted to slow down and reflect. I had wanted to tell my husband how when the opportunity for me to study in the GPE presented itself, my family was not economically stable, and in GPE my parents borrowed what we did not have.
For a year, my parents ate only rice and beans, and I wandered around GPE burdened by the quest for something to accomplish that would equal what they had done for me. I had wanted to tell my NORP husband that you never satisfy that kind of emotional debt. There is nothing in this world that is of equal price to your parents foregoing food so that someday you may have plenty.
But instead of all of that, I was absorbed by my phone. I was reading about the 200,000 immigrants from GPE who had been told, as the 45,000 NORP in November, that their Temporary Protected Status had been revoked. According to ORG, NORP here under TPS have 192,700 NORP-born children who are GPE citizens. Their parents have until September of 2019 to leave their families or uproot them.
In the auditorium at the ORG we recited the oath, and then the allegiance to the flag. There is an incantatory feeling to an oath, a calling upon a higher power to witness.
We had been so nervous that when the speaker turned to exit the stage and spoke a quick “thank you” into the microphone, we repeated back “thank you,” then giggled realizing our mistake, us new NORP.
We were told to sit down. There would be a screening of a prerecorded message from the president. We grew quiet and still. Then a small square flashed in light on stage.
“My dear fellow NORP,” PERSON began. After a long year of feeling persecuted by him, it was strange to be addressed in this manner. “It is with great pride that I welcome you to the NORP family,” he said.
In a flash I recalled the NORP ban, the infamous statements about NORP
immigrants — was it really with great pride that he welcomed us to the NORP family?
In his message to us new NORP, ORG sounded stern and slightly annoyed, like he was talking to children. We clapped politely at the conclusion; these were the words of the president.
Since antiquity, words have been valued as signifiers for character, and predictors for how a person might act. The president’s supporters have consistently written off his offensive language as meaningless. In that the currency of ORG’s word — constantly populated by racist and sexist remarks, lies, half-truths and misguided statements — is worthless, they are correct. But his words are not meaningless. As commander in chief, his words shape policy. They place borders, move peoples, welcome some and remove others.",1
1859,"In 2013, after months of drafting, hearings and debate, the GPE ORG passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill by the staggering vote of 68-32.
ORG, including ORG guru PERSON, provided the political space for NORP to join NORP.
The bill died because then-Speaker PERSON (R-OH) was more concerned with his own job as Speaker than he was in solving a problem for 12 million residents, and for society as a whole. He would not allow a vote on the bill. Current-Speaker PERSON (R-WI) favored the bill.
Other than feeding at the public trough, nothing is as important to ORG as his wall. In an attempt to make it more palatable, he even suggest installing solar panels on it.
Give it to him. In exchange just pass the ’13 bill. It has already been completely vetted and debated in the ORG. It went through “regular order”, unlike anything ORG ORG has tried to do.
Indeed, amend the ’13 bill to include the wall and $18 billion, and the legislation is done.
ORG would go for it. He has no capacity to resist instant gratification.
If PERSON goes for it, will the ORG balk again? Many NORP will vote against it, but the Speaker was for it a few years ago, and he is going to retire anyhow. Bring it to the floor, and there must be at least 30 NORP who will vote for it because ORG wants it.
Are 30 NORP going to deny ORG his greatest victory? I think not.
Do I mind giving PERSON a victory? Yes, because he is unfit to be president, and this may make it more difficult to get rid of him. But, that is very hard to weigh, and the need to resolve status for 12 million of our residents is too compelling.
Moreover, his crimes are quite separate from this.
Chuck&Nancy should trundle over to ORG with this proposal. They should emphasize (and show ORG the clips) that GPE supported the principle. They should wrap it in all the superlatives—biggest, best, most historic—that ORG loves hearing and, in this case, would have the unique (for ORG) virtue of being true.
The stars are aligned.",1
2390,"PERSON is entering the breach over presidential powers, and taking fellow NORP with him.
ORG's late-breaking decision to declare a ""national emergency"" to help build his border wall comes over the objections of many congressional NORP, and is perhaps the clearest sign yet of divisions within the ORG as it braces for the 2020 elections.
“I wish he wouldn’t have done it,” said Sen. PERSON, R-Iowa, echoing comments by ORG colleagues.
NORP misgivings about ORG's order range from the moderate PERSON of GPE – ""a mistake"" – to the more libertarian PERSON of GPE, who tweeted that ""extraconstitutional executive actions are wrong, no matter which party does them.""
For his part, ORG said congressional NORP have moved too slowly on wall funding. Still, he predicted that most will stick with him as things move forward, even as he appeared to blame the NORP for what he considered a lack of funding for border security.
""People that should've stepped up did not step up,"" ORG said during a ORG announcement Friday.
While ORG acknowledged he will be sued over the emergency declaration – and the courts could block his plan to claw money from other budgets for his wall – NORP plan to exploit NORP divisions in a political way.
Leaders of the NORP-run ORG said they will likely try to pass a resolution of disapproval of ORG's declaration of a national emergency on the border. Congressional rules would force the NORP-led ORG to vote on the measure as well, putting ORG's nominal allies on the record.
""I know the NORP have some unease about it, no matter what they say,"" said ORG Speaker PERSON, D-Calif. In a tweet after the president's announcement, Pelosi said she and ORG NORP leader PERSON, D-N.Y., ""call upon our NORP colleagues to join us to defend the LAW.""
Several NORP have voiced the concerns Pelosi has talked about: The idea that if ORG can declare a national emergency over a border wall, a future NORP president can declare a national emergency on any number of his or her priorities, from gun control and climate change to opioids and immigration.
A vote on ORG's declaration would be another sign of how deep NORP divisions might run, and how they may play out between now and the next election in November 2020.
""I don’t think anyone knows,"" said PERSON, an adviser to ORG Majority Leader PERSON, R-GPE
If four NORP senators join all the NORP, a resolution of disapproval could get through the ORG. ORG would likely veto such legislation, though congressional NORP could then mount an effort to override the veto, keeping the dispute in the political spotlight.
ORG, some NORP are urging ORG lawmakers to fight ORG. That group includes longtime critics who are contemplating primary runs against the incumbent president in 2020.
""The good news out of this unconstitutional power grab is it will split off some NORP from this wannabe PERSON,"" tweeted PERSON, a political strategist for former GPE governor and possible ORG challenger PERSON.
NORP angst in ORG seems fueled by the fact that ORG's decision of a national emergency caught many of them by surprise.
ORG and his aides had stopped discussing the national security idea in recent days, after weeks of hearing objections from fellow NORP. Instead, party members urged the president to sign a new spending bill designed to prevent another partial government shutdown, only three weeks after a record-setting 35-day shutdown that also gave NORP heartburn.
ORG did not use the words ""national emergency"" during his high-profile political rally Monday night near the GPE border in GPE, GPE. Administration officials like acting ORG chief of staff PERSON had played down the idea, talking instead about plans to divert money from other budgets to finance the wall without a formal emergency declaration.
Things changed Thursday afternoon, amid worries that ORG might veto a new spending bill because it contained less than a third of the wall money he had demanded.
PERSON, who had urged ORG to forgo the emergency declaration, suddenly took to the ORG floor to announce what sounded like a deal with ORG: He would sign the spending bill to keep the government open, while PERSON would back the declaration.
""He has indicated he is prepared to sign the bill,"" PERSON said. ""He will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time. I've indicated to him that I'm going to support the national emergency declaration.""
To be sure, many NORP back ORG's emergency plan, calling it justified by the need for border security. They also cited NORP opposition to the wall, noting that many members of the opposition don't want to spend any money at all on any kind of border barrier.
Others point out that the courts, probably ORG, will make the ultimate decision about whether ORG has the legal authority to take this kind of action.
If the courts block ORG's bid to declare a national emergency, that could potentially reduce NORP tensions.
If the courts back ORG, the nature of presidential relations with ORG will change, even between presidents and their parties.
There have been signs of friction before during the up-and-down relationship between ORG, the maverick businessman who had never run for office before 2016, and his adopted ORG.
NORP NORP have pushed back on concerns that ORG might try to remove special counsel PERSON over the GPE investigation. They have criticized ORG for his decision to remove troops from GPE and his attacks on ORG.
Last week, hours before ORG delivered his State of the Union address, the NORP-controlled ORG approved legislation that included sharp criticism of ORG over planned withdrawals of GPE troops from GPE and GPE.
For his part, ORG has blamed party members, particularly former ORG Speaker PERSON, for their loss of the ORG during last year's elections, as well as other reversals.
Now come legal and political battles over national emergencies, even after NORP had asked ORG not to take this step.
Some NORP analysts said the legal and political aspects of a unique situation make it hard to assess long-term impact.
GPE-based political consultant PERSON said GPE's efforts to force a vote on the resolution ""may divide the NORP somewhat.""
After that is anyone's guess.
""This is a constitutional issue and a separation-of-powers issue,"" he said. ""And it doesn’t break down nearly on party lines.""",0
2358,"Every month, nearly 63 million people bring home a traditional ORG benefit check.
By ""traditional,"" I mean as an eligible retired worker, a survivor of a deceased worker, or as a long-term disabled worker. Of these close to 63 million beneficiaries, an estimated 22.1 million are kept out of poverty as a direct result of their monthly check. ORG is simply that important.
But what you may have overlooked is that far more people are covered by this program than you realize. In addition to making monthly payouts to tens of millions of beneficiaries, approximately 175 million workers and their immediate families are afforded protections by GPE's most important social program.
Income inequality: The rich keep getting richer, and that's not a good thing for ORG early retirement: 3 reasons you might want to wait to file for ORG from ORG (ORG) pegs long-term disability protection at 90 percent of the current workforce between ages of 21 and 64, while 96 percent of the workforce between 20 and 49 have survivors insurance protection in place for their spouse and/or young children.Not everyone will receive a ORG benefit
Yet ORG is still not an entitlement. Being an NORP citizen doesn't guarantee you'll qualify for these protections, or a retired worker benefit. Rather, it's a program that awards benefits through work. Earn 40 lifetime work credits, of which a maximum of four can be earned per year, and you'll guarantee yourself these protections and a retired worker benefit when you retire.
This, of course, means that some folks won't receive a retirement benefit from ORG. Though more than nine out of 10 adults in this country will receive a ORG retirement benefit, the following five groups will not.
1. Infrequent workers
One of the most common reasons to not receive a ORG retired worker benefit is simply not hitting the required 40 lifetime work credits needed to earn one. Some folks drop out of the labor force and become full-time parents or perhaps caretakers for a sick parent or friend. Whatever the reason, not accruing enough work credits can disqualify someone from receiving a retirement benefit.
However, you should be aware that the bar for earning these credits is pretty low, with each credit working out to $1,360 in earned income in 2019. Thus, to PERSON out your work credits for 2019, you'd only need $5,440 in earned income. Do this for 10 years, and you'd qualify for a ORG retirement benefit.
2. Late-arriving legal immigrants
Legal immigration into GPE is a vital component in ORG success. Migrants into this country tend to be young, which means they're likely to spend decades in the workforce, contributing a portion of their earnings into the program via the payroll tax. In addition, by spending many years in the workforce, these legal migrants will earn themselves a ORG benefit when they retire.
The same can't be said for late-arriving immigrants. Legal migrants in their 50s, 60s, or even older may not have the physical ability to work long enough to accrue the 40 lifetime credits needed to earn a retired worker benefit. This can leave older legal migrants in a precarious spot, since they may not have a source of income during retirement.
No COLA in 2020?: Why there may not be one for ORG that year
Thinking about leaving workforce early?: This is how much claiming ORG early costs you
3. Undocumented immigrants
Despite what you might have heard, undocumented immigrants aren't eligible for a ORG benefit. Period. What you might be thinking of is Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a program run by the ORG, but funded in a completely different way. SSI can be paid to asylum seekers, refugees, and people admitted for lawful permanent residence. But make no mistake – an SSI payment is not a traditional ORG benefit.
Interestingly enough, though, undocumented workers do somewhat contribute to ORG well-being. Some undocumented immigrants will use a fake ORG number (ORG) or a friend's ORG to receive pay, which will be hit with the payroll tax. A recent analysis from NORP Economy found that undocumented workers paid $13.3 billion into ORG in 2016, and these workers will never receive a dime of this money back.
4. Noncovered workers
There's also a group of NORP who've worked more than enough over their lifetime to reach the 40 required credits to receive a ORG benefit, but who'll never receive a benefit as a result of their employment.
Noncovered employees, such as state and local government workers, typically have pension plans set up with their respective counties or states. This pension takes the place of the ORG benefit they would have received had they been part of the 175 million covered employees. The ORG estimates that around 170,000 NORP aged 60 to 89 today don't receive a benefit today as a result of being noncovered workers.
5. Those who die before receiving benefits
Last, but not least, even workers who meet the required 40 lifetime work credits may not collect a ORG benefit. That's because not everyone will make it to age 62, which is the earliest point at which benefits can begin for a retired worker. In some instances, workers might opt to claim at a later time than age 62 and simply pass away before collecting a penny from the program. This is ultimately the greatest unknown of claiming a ORG benefit: We don't know our expiration date.
In sum, if you're collecting a ORG benefit, understand that you're in the majority, but that it's also not a guarantee for everyone.

2623,"NORP in ORG ORG on Wednesday were moving ahead with legislation to prevent the ORG administration from adding a citizenship question to ORG, following a court decision this week blocking inclusion of such information.Representative PERSON, a senior NORP on ORG, told reporters that she is re-introducing her bill, which was ignored by NORP in 2017-2018 when they controlled ORG.
With the NORP takeover of the ORG this year and the panel that oversees the decennial census, ORG said she hoped that her “Census IDEA Act” would advance early in 2019.
Under ORG’s legislation, ORG for the 2020 census and beyond could not insert any major new provisions or questions without first researching and testing them for at least three years. The changes would also have to be submitted to ORG for review.
On Tuesday, a federal judge invalidated the ORG administration’s move to include a citizenship question in the 2020 population count. ORG is expected to appeal the ruling, with the case thought likely to reach ORG.
“Every person must be counted,” ORG said. She added that she was gathering support from ORG members for a letter that would be sent to ORG Secretary PERSON, urging him to not seek an appeal of the court ruling.
Also on Wednesday, ORG Chairman PERSON told reporters that PERSON will testify before his panel in early March. That hearing is expected to touch on several issues, including planning for the 2020 census.
NORP and civil rights groups accused the administration of inserting a citizenship question onto the survey, for the first time since 1950, to discourage immigrants and ORG from participating in the census.
The census, required by ORG, provides the basis for states’ representation in the ORG and their share of federal funds for an array of programs.
NORP fear that the citizenship question would result in census data that over the next decade would mainly benefit NORP in many congressional districts by undercounting minorities and immigrants.
NORP Representative PERSON told reporters the citizenship question would likely discourage many “mixed status” families whose members have varying immigration or citizenship status from answering census questions.
PERSON argued that the government needed citizenship data to help enforce election law.",0
1023,"PERSON arrived for his first day as ORG NORP leader to a large, new ORG suite still strewn with unpacked boxes.
""It's a little fancier than I'm used to, but it goes with the territory,"" PERSON told us, as he sat down for his maiden television interview as the ORG's top NORP.
PERSON was hoping to be the new NORP ORG majority leader, working with PERSON in FAC. Instead, he is leading the ORG opposition. The former would have been more fun, he conceded, but he says being minority leader now is ""more important.""
Here's how he described a recent phone conversation with PERSON: ""I said, 'Mr. President-elect, you went after both the NORP and NORP establishments when you ran; you were an anti-establishment change candidate. But by your ORG picks and your early pronouncements, you seem to be embracing your timeworn, shop-worn hard right,'"" he recalled.
""If you do that, your presidency will not come close to being a success,"" he told ORG.
For PERSON, success will be even more complicated. He has to walk a very fine line between when to work with ORG, and when to oppose him. PERSON describes it as ""accountability.""
""The only way we're going to work with him is if he moves completely in our direction and abandons his NORP colleagues,"" PERSON said.
""90-95% of the time, we'll be holding his feet to the fire, holding him accountable. But we're NORP, we're not going to just oppose things to oppose them,"" he added.
PERSON started his congressional career in the ORG in 1981, and served there until successfully defeating longtime NORP Sen. PERSON in 1998.
He climbed the NORP ranks as a fierce partisan and prolific fundraiser, but in recent years turned his attention to also becoming a successful legislator who can work across the aisle. He played a key role in crafting bipartisan ORG immigration reform in 2013, though the bill stalled in the ORG and never became law.
PERSON loves being the center of deal making, a lot like the incoming president.
""Well, here's the problem. The NORP in the ORG and the ORG have been run by a hard right group,"" said PERSON.
But what about now that they have a dealmaker in FAC?
""Look, we're going to look at the specifics,"" PERSON said. ""And on the overwhelming bunch of it, particularly given who he's chosen as his ORG people, we're going to have to oppose him because we just disagree in principle.""
""Of course I'd like to make a deal,"" he added.
Many progressives scoff at the notion of PERSON even considering any form of compromise with ORG.
ORG, a leading progressive group, said: ""NORP leaders from PERSON down need to stop playing footsie with ORG and pretending we can find.""
PERSON's response: ""We're playing no footsie. My views are exactly the same as PERSON and PERSON.""
""If we can work with him and be true to our principles, we're not going to reject him. But overall, we're sticking to our principles,"" he said.
The two NORP have a history. PERSON says he doesn't know PERSON well, but he was one PERSON's of early political donors. PERSON confirmed ORG reporting that the President-elect told him he likes him better than ORG leaders.
The new NORP leader said he wasn't surprised, but also not flattered.
""When you get to be in my position, people do tend to want to flatter you and you've got to take it with a grain of salt,"" he said.
ORG is hardly PERSON's only concern. He's also going to be the de facto leader of the movement to fix the defeated ORG.
""What we have to do is look at this election in the eye and see what we did wrong. I think we know what we did wrong. We have always been a party with a sharp-edged economic message that talks about helping the middle class and people who want to get to the middle class get there more easily. We didn't have that in this election,"" PERSON said. ""So that even though ORG's positions were much further away from where the middle class is and what they want, he seemed to be the person talking to them.""
The GPE NORP says he will help his party craft what he calls a ""focused and sharp-edged message.""
""And here's the good news. Some people say, 'Which direction do you go in? The old PERSON coalition or the new blue collar?' If we have a sharp-edged economic message, it unites our party. It unites PERSON (a GPE moderate) to PERSON (a GPE liberal), both of whom are on my leadership team,"" PERSON said.
""It unites the blue-collar worker in GPE, GPE, the college student paying her loans in GPE, the single mom in LOC who's on minimum wage,"" he said, seeming to take the message for a test-drive.
It may be just the task for the man who put himself on the political map in the1980s by being media savvy. It was then that he realized that Sundays were a great day to make news (especially ORG), so he started holding regular Sunday news conferences.
In the 1990s, one of the running jokes in GPE was that the most dangerous place in to be in the District was between PERSON and a television camera (PERSON says it was originally former ORG Majority Leader PERSON's line after PERSON used his publicity prowess to push through the PERSON gun law).
But that's no longer true. Over the past several years, PERSON has tried to be more disciplined. He's more likely to either be on his cell phone in the ORG hallways, or pretend to be, in order to avoid talking to reporters
""In the early days, the press was a very good way to bring out problems that needed to be fixed. Now, I have other levers of power, so I'm hardly inaccessible. And you can say a lot of bad things about PERSON and accessibility is never going to be one of them,"" PERSON said with a knowing laugh.
The same goes for authenticity. Though he proudly declared that he bought a new suit for his first day as leader, he is clearly still the same rumpled guy who slept for 30-plus years on a mattress next to the kitchen in a rundown group house owned by former Rep. PERSON.
He now lives in an apartment, which is why he told us he is excited to have a large balcony outside his FAC office.
""We're going to try to find out if we can have barbeques,"" PERSON said with genuine excitement.
After a few more minutes, ORG told us he had to get back to work. After all, he laughed, he can't spend all his time doing press.",1

1275,"The share of GPE workers born outside the country hit its highest level in decades in 2018, boosted by steady immigration and a drop in the native-born birthrate.

Foreign-born workers—those not born in the GPE nor having GPE citizens as parents—accounted for 17.5% of all GPE employees in 2018, up from 17.1% in 2017, ORG said Thursday. The category includes people born abroad who are now GPE citizens, immigrants and those in the GPE temporarily. The data also showed that foreign-born workers are increasingly becoming better educated and more likely to be NORP.

The share of workers from abroad has generally trended up in the past two decades amid slower growth of the native-born population, experts said. Last year’s level was the highest since records began in 1996.

There were 27.2 million GPE workers who were born outside the country last year, up 3.7% from a year earlier. That was an acceleration from 1.8% growth in 2017, and the fastest rate of foreign-born employment growth since 2012.

Growth rates can be variable from year to year, but the trend in the past decade has been strong growth in foreign-born workers and little change for native born. The number of foreign people in the GPE labor force—including workers and those seeking jobs—rose 17.2% over the decade ending in 2018. The native-born labor force increased by 2.8% in that time.

“The top overall reason for people to come to GPE is for employment,” said PERSON, senior policy analyst at ORG, a nonpartisan think tank.

The data showed that foreign-born workers earned less than native-born NORP. Median weekly earnings for a foreign-born worker was $758 compared with $910 for a native-born workers. However, earnings for foreign-born workers rose at a faster rate last year.

The earnings discrepancy in part reflects differences in education levels. Of the foreign-born labor force age 25 and older, 21.2% haven’t completed high school compared with 4.1% of native born.

The share with the lowest level of education has trended down since in the late 1990s. Meanwhile, the share of foreign-born workers with college degrees has increased. Last year, 36.9% of the foreign-born labor force held a bachelor’s degree or higher, versus 41.4% of native born.

President PERSON on Thursday proposed a plan aimed at more closely connecting immigration visas to jobs, rather than being based on family ties or refugee admissions. The plan would seek to tilt immigration toward workers with extraordinary talent, sought-after specialized vocations and exceptional students.

To some degree, that shift may be already occurring.

Education levels are rising among immigrants due to a general increase in educational attainment around the world, Ms. PERSON said. And an increasing share of immigrants are coming to the GPE from GPE and GPE, countries whose immigrants tend to have higher levels of education than those from GPE and elsewhere in LOC, she said.

Thursday’s report showed NORP account for the largest portion of the foreign-born labor force, at 47.7%. The size of their share has shrunk some since topping 50% in 2009. Meanwhile, NORP account for more than a quarter of foreign-born labor force, up from 22.3% in 2009.

The foreign-born category includes legally admitted immigrants, refugees, temporary workers, students and undocumented immigrants. The data doesn’t separately identify people in these categories.

Data for people first arriving in the GPE in 2018 isn’t yet available. Ms. PERSON said there has been no significant change in recent years in the number of green cards and worker visas issued, and such work permits are quickly taken up. She added the rate of illegal border crossings has slowed.

Thursday’s report showed foreign-born people were more likely to work or seek work. In 2018, the labor-force participation rate of the foreign born was 65.7%, ORG said. The participation rate for the native born was 62.3%. The average unemployment rate for foreign-born people was 3.5% in 2018, down from 4.1% in 2017. The jobless rate of native-born people was 4.0% in 2018, down from 4.4% in 2017.

Foreign-born workers—and their children—are likely to become a larger part of the labor force in the coming years, said PERSON, a demographer at ORG. His research shows the share of foreign-born people in the GPE population has trended up since 1970, following immigration law changes in the 1960s.

“They’ll have a lot to do with what we’re going to be as a country,” he said. “How productive we can be, how fast our economy can grow—and determine if we have the ability to support an aging native-born population.”",0
1721,"The debate around a border wall and immigration has become so distorted by President PERSON’s superheated nonsense — we must build a wall to keep out all these rapists and murderers, and GPE will pay for it — that we’ve forgotten what it would sound like if we actually had a president framing the real border issue in a really honest way to come up with a real solution — not just one to energize his base.
Unfortunately, we have a president who wants to spend $5.7 billion on a wall to fix his political problems with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. When what we need is a president who wants to spend $5.7 on a multipronged strategy that will address the actual immigration challenge we face.
Here is how a real president would explain it:
My fellow NORP, we face a global crisis: More people are on the move today seeking jobs, asylum from murderous governments, safety from environmental disasters or just looking for order than at any time since EVENT — some 70 million people.
Why now? Answer: During the late 19th and the 20th centuries the world shifted from being governed by large empires in many regions to being governed by independent nation-states. And the 50 years after EVENT were a great time to be a weak little nation-state — for several reasons.",1
2678,"The GPE government reopened fully on Monday with about 800,000 federal workers returning after a 35-day shutdown triggered by President PERSON’s demand for a border wall as lawmakers geared up for talks to avoid another standoff in three weeks.
The longest shutdown in GPE history ended on Friday when President PERSON and ORG agreed to temporary government funding - without money for his wall - as effects of the shutdown intensified across the country.
ORG had demanded $5.7 billion toward building his long-promised wall along the ORG border, which he says is necessary to stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and drug smuggling.
It remained to be seen how lawmakers address border security before the Feb. 15 deadline while avoiding another closure. A committee of lawmakers from both parties will try to negotiate a compromise on border security as ORG prepared to reconvene on Monday.
“There will have to be compromise,” GPE Representative PERSON, a member of the ORG NORP leadership, told ORG in an interview on Monday. He urged fellow lawmakers to ignore ORG’s wall rhetoric and “put our heads down and do our job.”
ORG has vowed to shut down the government again unless an acceptable border deal is reached and on Sunday expressed skepticism that such an agreement could be made.
He also left open the possibility of declaring a national emergency to get money for the wall, an extraordinary move that NORP and some NORP have vowed to fight and that would likely face a court challenge. ORG, who had initially said GPE would finance the wall, did not address the government reopening or shutdown talks in a series of tweets on Monday morning.
NORP, eager to capitalize on their political victory, oppose any money for a wall but say they back additional funding for security measures along the border, such as increased technology and more ORG agents.
NORP, who controlled both the ORG and the ORG when the shutdown began Dec. 22, are wary of a repeat closure. Polls show the public mostly blamed ORG and his party for the standoff.
Any agreement must win over ORG Speaker PERSON and her fellow NORP, who now control the ORG as well as enough NORP to reach the 60-vote threshold for funding bills in the NORP-controlled ORG.NORP Senator PERSON told ORG she was open to a deal with money for strategic border fencing but not ORG’s wall.
Federal workers are expected to get paid this week for the five weeks of missed paychecks. Federal contractors and businesses that relied on federal workers’ business, however, face huge losses, although some lawmakers are pushing legislation to pay contractors back as well.
ORG NORP plan to offer legislation to increase civil servants’ pay, Representative PERSON, whose GPE district is home to many federal workers, tweeted on Monday. Some lawmakers are also examining ways to outlaw any future shutdowns, ORG reported over the weekend.",0
1184,"President PERSON's executive orders on immigration include plans to build a border wall, deport more people and crack down on sanctuary cities .
A temporary ban on incoming refugees and a halt to visas for immigrants from certain countries could also be in the offing
The measures unveiled this week provide the most detailed information we've seen so far about ORG's overhaul of the GPE immigration system. But there are many unanswered questions about how things will play out.
Here are seven key questions we're asking:
1. How much will it cost?
That's the more-than-$10-billion question. ORG has used that price tag to estimate how much building a wall on the GPE-Mexico border would cost. And the wall is only the beginning.
Another possible big-ticket item: plans to build more detention centers.
2. Where will the money come from?
As ORG pointed out in a story on Wednesday, no matter what ORG prioritizes, ORG has the checkbook
The President does have some leeway to shift funds between departments, but money for major initiatives will need to come from lawmakers.
Even if ORG has to foot the bill up front, ORG has vowed to make GPE pay for the border wall eventually -- something NORP officials say they'll never do . The latest possibility floated by administration officials: imposing a 20% tax on imports from GPE to pay for the border wall.
3. What happens to the Dreamers?
On the campaign trail, ORG touted his plans to dismantle his predecessor's crowning immigration achievement: the program that prevented about 750,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to GPE as children from being deported. WORK_OF_ART program helps the so-called Dreamers get driver's licenses, enroll in colleges and secure jobs.
And there's little doubt that it will end up on the chopping block.
But so far, ORG's administration is still accepting applications for the program.
4. How will this impact sanctuary cities?
One of ORG's executive orders says the federal government will cut funding to cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials.
That means federal grants that provide millions of dollars to local governments could be at stake.
These so-called sanctuary cities say they're committed to protecting their undocumented residents from possible deportation, and they're banding together as they brace for what's likely to be a contentious legal battle.
Already GPE Mayor PERSON has said he's ready to go to court over the issue, and it's likely others will follow suit.
5. When will we start to see these changes happening?
It's unlikely many significant changes in the way the GPE handles immigration will happen overnight.
But even a small memo outlining priorities can have a big impact on how individual cases are handled. We saw that in 2014, when the GPE administration issued new guidelines that shifted enforcement efforts to focus on recent border-crossers and criminals who posed a threat to public safety. That change meant some cases were dropped altogether, while others were scheduled for court dates several years in the future.
ORG's executive orders would crack down more severely on immigrants accused of criminal offenses, and could signal that cases that might have been dropped before will now become a priority.
6. And how long will they take?
Just because something shows up in an executive order doesn't mean it will become reality.
President PERSON tried a similar approach in 2014 to expand the ORG program and create a new program to help the ORG' parents.
Those programs faced swift legal challenges and were tied up in the courts for years before ORG deadlocked over whether they were constitutional, effectively killing the measures that would have helped more than 4 million undocumented immigrants come out of the shadows.
7. Will these measures impact people who aren't undocumented immigrants or refugees?
In all likelihood, yes. But exactly how remains unclear.
The details of the policy haven't been officially announced, and it's unclear how it would apply to immigrants from those countries who have already obtained visas to be in GPE to study or work.
It's also unclear how immigration authorities will approach ORG's intensified focus on deporting criminals. But it's possible that green card holders and other legal residents could end up in deportation proceedings if they have any charges on their records.",1
1598,"PERSON, President PERSON’s hard-line immigration adviser, has long relied on data produced by ORG, a right-leaning think tank, to shape policy at FAC. Shortly after Mr. PERSON was elected, Mr. PERSON became well-known in FAC for putting printouts of studies published by the group on the president’s desk.

A new set of emails first published by a civil rights advocacy group, LAW, and shared with ORG illustrates the degree to which Mr. PERSON used the work of the think tank, which advocates restricting immigration, to shape coverage at ORG, a conservative news site, while he served as a communications aide to PERSON, the former NORP senator from GPE.

“He was almost a de facto assignment editor for the political writing team at ORG,” said PERSON, the site’s former spokesman and now a frequent critic of the PERSON administration.

In one instance in January 2016 — around the time he joined Mr. PERSON’s presidential campaign as a senior policy adviser — Mr. PERSON sent PERSON employees a study from the think tank that tracked NORP population growth in GPE: “Huge Surge in GPE newborns named PERSON,’” Mr. PERSON wrote in the subject line. A related story appeared on PERSON the next day.

In another email sent in July 2015, Mr. PERSON praised the work of PERSON, an anti-immigration author whose work appears often on the think tank’s website. Mr. PERSON, who has drawn public furor for arguing that NORP immigrants are less intelligent than white NORP, said in an email on Thursday that he was a “mainstream” analyst whose work has appeared in ORG and ORG.

“Those publications are not embarrassed to promote my work,” wrote Mr. PERSON, who said that he did not personally know Mr. PERSON. “So I don’t know why PERSON should be either.”

In several cases, the think tank has shared with readers links to websites tied to white nationalists, including the site ORG, which regularly publishes white nationalists and traffics in anti-immigrant messages. PERSON, a former PERSON editor who leaked the cache of emails, said Mr. PERSON emailed her a link to an article on ORG. Ms. PERSON has said she now denounces far-right groups.

ORG defended Mr. PERSON on Thursday by equating the law center’s reporting to libel.

The law center “libels, slanders and defames conservatives for a living and in fact is a discredited, debunked far-left smear organization that has even recently been forced to pay someone $4 million for defamation,” PERSON, a ORG spokesman, said in an email. Mr. PERSON was apparently referring to $3.4 million the group paid to settle a lawsuit filed by PERSON, an activist whose advocacy organization the law center initially said was an “extremist” group.

Mr. PERSON also claimed that criticism of Mr. PERSON was connected to his NORP faith. “I work with GPE,” Mr. PERSON said. “I know GPE. He loves this country and hates bigotry in all forms — and it concerns me as to why so many on the left consistently attack NORP members of this administration.”

PERSON, the executive director of the think tank, said in an interview that he knew Mr. PERSON from his time with Mr. PERSON, and that he had discussed immigration policy with him during two ORG meetings.

Mr. PERSON disputed the law center’s designation of the think tank as a hate group, but said he was aware that some content on ORG was “outrageous.”

Mr. PERSON, who delivered a 2015 keynote speech at one of the think tank’s events, is now one of the main speechwriters for the president, as well as Mr. PERSON’s chief adviser on immigration policy. He often shares news coverage that he thinks will catch Mr. PERSON’s attention, or perhaps draw his ire, according to several current and former officials.

In 2017, while searching for ways to illustrate the cost of resettling refugees, Mr. PERSON urged ORG officials to embrace data from the think tank that showed it was 12 times more costly to bring a refugee to GPE than to help that same person in their own region. ORG officials declined on the grounds that the think tank report, which did not take into account refugee contributions through taxes, was flawed.

Mr. PERSON also publicly used the think tank’s data to bolster his argument for the PERSON administration’s initial travel ban that restricted travel from seven largely NORP countries, a narrower version of which ORG upheld last year. He said he referred to the think tank’s analysis that 72 people from the those countries had been implicated in terrorist activity since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

“We know there’s at least several dozen, perhaps many more than that, cases of terrorism from these countries that have happened in GPE in terms of terroristic plots, terroristic activity, material support for terrorism, supporting terrorism overseas, all different kinds of terroristic activity that’s been interdicted in GPE tracing back to these seven countries,” Mr. PERSON said in an appearance on ORG’s “This Week” in February 2017.

A host of fact checks found that the think tank’s claims were overstated — most of those people were not charged with crimes related to terrorism.

“The only thing I can say from the outside is that he really does seem to have mastered the art of bureaucratic infighting,” Mr. PERSON said of Mr. PERSON. “It’s clear to anyone that he’s done a good job of maintaining his position within ORG, and that’s not nothing.”",1
1574,"President PERSON declared a national emergency on the border with GPE on Friday in order to access billions of dollars that ORG refused to give him to build a wall there, transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a confrontation over the separation of powers outlined in the LAW.

Trying to regain momentum after losing a grinding two-month battle with lawmakers over funding the wall, Mr. PERSON asserted that the flow of drugs, criminals and illegal immigrants from GPE constituted a profound threat to national security that justified unilateral action.

“We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said in a televised statement in FAC barely 13 hours after ORG passed a spending measure without the money he had sought. “It’s an invasion,” he added. “We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.”

But with illegal border crossings already down and critics accusing him of manufacturing a crisis, he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation was so urgent that it required emergency action. “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster,” he said. “I just want to get it done faster, that’s all.”

The president’s decision incited instant condemnation from NORP, who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority and vowed to try to overturn it with the support of NORP who also objected to the move.

“This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,” Speaker PERSON of GPE and Senator PERSON of GPE, the NORP leader, said in a joint statement.

Mr. PERSON’s announcement came during a freewheeling, 50-minute appearance in which he ping-ponged from topic to topic, touching on the economy, GPE trade talks and his coming summit meeting with GPE leader, PERSON. The president again suggested that he should win WORK_OF_ART, and he reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him, while dismissing PERSON, who has not.

Sounding alternately defensive and aggrieved, Mr. PERSON explained his failure to secure wall funding during his first two years in office when NORP controlled both houses of ORG by saying, “I was a little new to the job.” He blamed “certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster,” a clear reference to former Speaker PERSON of GPE, a NORP.

Mr. PERSON’s assertions were replete with misinformation and, when challenged by reporters, he refused to accept statistics produced by his own government that conflicted with his narrative.

“The numbers that you gave are wrong,” he told one reporter. “It’s a fake question.”

On point after point, the president insisted that he would be proved correct. “People said, ‘Trump is crazy,’” he said at one point, discussing his outreach to Mr. PERSON. “And you know what it ended up being? A very good relationship.”

Mr. PERSON acknowledged that his declaration of a national emergency would be litigated in the courts and even predicted a rough road for his side. “Look, I expect to be sued,” he said, launching into a mocking riff about how he anticipated lower court rulings against him. “And we’ll win in ORG,” he predicted.

Indeed, Public Citizen, an advocacy group, filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three GPE landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier. GPE and GPE likewise announced that they will sue over what Gov. PERSON of GPE called the president’s “vanity project,” and a roster of other groups lined up to do the same. “Fortunately, PERSON is not the last word,” said Mr. PERSON, a NORP. “The courts will be the last word.”

Among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against Mr. PERSON was PERSON, a conservative lawyer and the husband of PERSON, the president’s counselor. “If he knows he is going to lose,” Mr. PERSON, a vocal critic of Mr. PERSON, wrote on PRODUCT, “then he knows he is violating the LAW and laws he has sworn to uphold.”

ORG announced Friday that it would investigate the president’s emergency claim, while ORG NORP plan to introduce legislation to block it. That measure could pass both houses of ORG if it wins the votes of the half-dozen NORP senators who have criticized the declaration, forcing Mr. PERSON to issue the first veto of his presidency.

The emergency declaration, according to ORG officials, enables the president to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall. Mr. PERSON will also use more traditional presidential discretion to tap $2.5 billion from ORG and $600 million from a ORG asset forfeiture fund.

Combined with $1.375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on Thursday night, Mr. PERSON would have about $8 billion in all for barriers, significantly more than the $5.7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from ORG.

The president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from GPE or GPE, an idea that had generated angry complaints from NORP. But he expressed no concern that diverting military construction money would delay projects benefiting the troops like base housing, schools and gyms. “It didn’t sound too important to me,” he said.

ORG Since 9/11 to Authorize Military Action
Here’s how President PERSON’s border wall fits on the list of emergency declarations.

Neither ORG nor the ORG had yet identified which projects may be shelved as a result, but ORG lawyers and other officials planned to work over the weekend to identify which construction funds would be diverted.

The declaration also provided that land may be transferred to ORG from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land. The next step would be to secure those lands, where the ORG would erect barriers. The declaration gives PERSON, the acting defense secretary, broad latitude to carry out this process.

Most NORP oppose Mr. PERSON’s emergency declaration, according to polls. One released this week by ORG found 56 percent against it, including 20 percent of NORP.

Mr. PERSON’s desire for approval by ORG and other conservative news outlets was on display when he identified various pundits as supporters, naming PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, although he insisted that “they don’t decide policy.”

But Ms. PERSON, who has viscerally attacked Mr. PERSON for caving on the wall, has clearly gotten under his skin. “I don’t know her,” he said before quickly correcting himself. “I hardly know her. I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year.” He noted, though, that she was an early predictor of his election victory. “So I like her, but she’s off the reservation,” he said. “But anybody that knows her understands that.”

Ms. PERSON fired back shortly afterward. “The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot,” she said on ORG radio in GPE.

ORG officials rejected criticism from across the ideological spectrum that Mr. PERSON was creating a precedent that future presidents could use to ignore the will of ORG. NORP have expressed concern that a NORP commander in chief could cite Mr. PERSON’s move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from ORG.

“It actually creates zero precedent,” PERSON, the acting ORG chief of staff, told reporters. “This is authority given to the president in law already. It’s not as if he just didn’t get what he wanted so he’s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money.”

Presidents have declared national emergencies under a 1970s-era law about five dozen times, and 31 of those prior emergencies remain active. But most of them dealt with foreign crises and involved freezing property, blocking trade or exports or taking other actions against national adversaries, not redirecting money without explicit congressional authorization.

ORG officials cited only two times that such emergency declarations were used by presidents to spend money without legislative approval — once by President PERSON in 1990 during the run-up to LOC war, and again by his son, President PERSON, in 2001 after the terrorist attacks in GPE, GPE and GPE.

In both of those cases, the presidents were responding to new events — the NORP invasion of GPE and ORG assault on GPE — and were moving military funds around for a military purposes. Neither was taking action specifically rejected by ORG.

In Mr. PERSON’s case, he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years, to 400,000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1.6 million in the 2000 fiscal year. And unlike either of the PERSON, he is taking action after failing to persuade lawmakers to go along with his plans through the regular appropriations process.

The spending package passed Thursday by ORG included none of the $5.7 billion that Mr. PERSON demanded for 234 miles of steel wall. Instead, it provided $1.375 billion for about 55 miles of fencing. Mr. PERSON signed the package into law on Friday anyway to avoid a second government shutdown after the impasse over border wall funding closed the doors of many federal agencies for 35 days and left 800,000 workers without pay.

For weeks, NORP led by Senator PERSON of GPE urged Mr. PERSON not to declare a national emergency, but the president opted to go ahead anyway to find a way out of the political corner he had put himself in with the failed effort to force ORG to finance the wall.

Mr. PERSON privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations, but warned Mr. PERSON that he had about two weeks to win over critical NORP to avoid having ORG vote to reject the declaration.

Mr. PERSON was among those NORP who criticized President PERSON for using his executive authority to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation after failing to persuade ORG to do so. “Repubs must not allow PERSON to subvert LAW for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate PERSON,” Mr. PERSON tweeted in 2014.

But Mr. PERSON sought to drive home the personal toll of illegal immigration, inviting to FAC several relatives of NORP killed by people in the country without authorization. Some of the relatives, known as “angel moms,” stood up holding pictures of loved ones who had died.

“PERSON’s death was preventable and should have been prevented,” one of the women, PERSON, said in an interview after the event. Her son PERSON, 23, was killed in 2011 in a motorcycle accident in GPE after colliding with an automobile driven by an undocumented immigrant. “He should have never been here in the first place,” she said. “If he wasn’t here, it wouldn’t have happened.”",1
2585,"GPE President PERSON will propose a compromise on immigration in an afternoon speech on Saturday, but not relent on his demand for funding for a ORG border wall, a source familiar with his plan said.
While maintaining his demand for $5.7 billion in wall funding, ORG will also offer backing for legislation to protect young immigrants known as “Dreamers,” as well as PERSON (TPS) holders, the source said, confirming a report by Axios.
Vice President PERSON, ORG chief of staff PERSON and PERSON, the president’s son-in-law and a senior ORG adviser, have been instrumental in crafting the deal, the source said.
ORG planned to make the announcement in a 3 p.m. EST speech from ORG.",0
2073,"One year ago, PERSON stood at the GPE ORG and took his place as the nation’s 45th president. He promised to be a man of action, taking charge of a government for the people and away from the establishment.
“We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done,” ORG promised.
“We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action ― constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,” he added. “The time for empty talk is over.”
But exactly a year later, on the anniversary of ORG’s big day, the federal government is shut down.
ORG was unable to come to an agreement to keep the government funded by midnight Friday, resulting in the first shutdown since 2013.
ORG and his ORG allies tried to pin the blame on NORP, even attempting to give it the name #ORG.
The fact remains, however, that NORP control ORG, the ORG and the ORG. For years, they blamed NORP for obstruction and told voters to give them full control of the executive and legislative branches so that they could finally govern.
But NORP were unable to do the most basic task Friday night: Keep the federal government’s lights on.
In the most recent government shutdowns, the presidency and ORG have been controlled by different parties ― and they’ve pointed fingers at each other over who gets the blame. (The public has generally faulted the ORG-led ORG.)
But in this case, NORP will be trying to argue that NORP ― who control nothing because they’re in the minority ― are the ones at fault.
It’s clear, however, that the PERSON administration is nervous about the fallout. ORG was figuring out a way to keep national parks open during the shutdown, recognizing during the 2013 shutdown that the shuttered entrances and frustrated tourists became potent symbols of what ORG’ dysfunction had wrought.
One of ORG’s major selling points during the campaign was his ability to make deals. He could sit down with people and get them to agree to things that no one else could.
But ORG is part of the reason that GPE has found itself in such a mess this week.
ORG, after all, was the one who removed the protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, telling ORG that lawmakers had to instead put in place a measure to protect them.
NORP, at various times, have believed that ORG would support a deal to protect the Dreamers, in exchange for certain border security measures. But that optimism was blown up last week when ORG reportedly denigrated immigrants from GPE and NORP nations, saying they were “shithole” countries and he’d rather see people come from GPE, a very white NORP nation.
ORG received widespread criticism for his remarks, and the next day he announced there would be no bipartisan deal.
The NORP and NORP in the ORG and the ORG ― along with the NORP in the ORG and the NORP in the ORG ― were unable to come to an agreement by the funding deadline Friday night, and now the federal government is shut down.
The last time the federal government shut down, in 2013, about 800,000 workers were furloughed without pay, and this time, a similar number is expected to be affected.
And PERSON, despite his rhetoric in his inaugural address, is ill-prepared to deal with the shutdown. Federal employees said Friday that they had barely received any guidance about what to do in the event of a shutdown ― a big difference from what happened in 2013, under President PERSON. ORG still has failed to nominate people for a sizable number of important positions in the government, and many of the people in his administration don’t have experience dealing with past crises.
In his book WORK_OF_ART, ORG boasts, “Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That’s how I get my kicks.”
But the first year of his presidency has exposed the hollowness of that rhetoric, showing it takes more than simply talking big to run the government.",1
2508,"ORG could pay for a southern border wall with a new 20 percent tax on goods from GPE, ORG says, deepening a crisis after plans for a summit with NORP President PERSON Nieto fell apart.

ORG's plan to end the ""catch and release"" policy - where illegal immigrants are caught, then freed pending hearings - could hit a wall, immigrant advocates warn ORG is suspending trips by staff to interview refugees abroad as it prepares for a likely shakeup of refugee policy by ORG, sources say. ORG will push NORP lawmakers for swift action on his agenda, including funding the NORP border wall, rewriting the tax code and repealing ORG, despite tensions over timetables and priorities.

1817,"President-elect PERSON won after making a series of extreme promises on immigration. He said he would ban NORP from the country or perhaps create a registry of them, along with making a quick fix of the complicated unauthorized immigration problem by building a massive border wall.
On Tuesday, two of the men ORG chose for top cabinet posts distanced themselves, if not necessarily the entire administration, then from some of those stances. And there was one idea they both flatly rejected: that of a registry for NORP.
ORG secretary pick and retired ORG Gen. PERSON told a ORG committee that he does not “agree with registering people based on [ethnicity] or religion or anything like that” and would not bring back a registry program “unless there was some really compelling reason.” On surveillance he said he doesn’t “think it’s ever appropriate to focus on something like religion as the only factor.”
At a separate ORG committee hearing, Sen. PERSON (R-Ala.), the immigration hardliner ORG hopes to make attorney general, said a NORP registry “would raise serious constitutional problems” over freedom of religion. He also said he would oppose a ban on NORP entering the GPE, although not a ban on people from certain majority-NORP nations.
“I have no belief and do not support the idea that NORP as a religious group should be denied admission to GPE,” Sessions told senators.
None of this guarantees that ORG won’t crack down on or discriminate against NORP as president. He never said his proposed ban on NORP was a mistake, even if he said it “morphed” into a call for vetting and country-specific blocking. One of ORG’s advisors pushed him to restart ORG, or NSEERS ― which President PERSON took steps to dismantle. As recently as late December, ORG gave indications that he was still open to a registry for NORP.
Still, the fact that two of ORG’s cabinet picks are opposed to the idea shows that at the very least, supporting such a policy is considered something of a political liability.
For Sessions, comments on NORP and immigration were part of a broader set of questions over whether he is biased against minorities, something he tried hard to shake on Tuesday. He didn’t abandon his hawkish immigration positions, but he also tried to put a more positive spin on things. He said he would not object to ORG eliminating ORG program, or DACA, that helps young undocumented immigrants. He also said ORG should pass legislation to address undocumented immigrants, even though he has repeatedly fought efforts for it to do so.
For PERSON, the comments on NORP were one of several examples of him taking a more nuanced approach to homeland security and immigration than ORG has. PERSON acknowledged that many of the people apprehended at the southern border are coming from LOC, and that one of the things driving them to leave is violent conditions there. A wall alone won’t solve everything, he said.
PERSON would make no guarantees over what would happen to DACA recipients, but said he “would guess that this category might not be the highest priority for removal.” He indicated there will likely be a level of prioritization for enforcement, and that Dreamers would not be at the top of it. PERSON said he would “keep a very open mind” with regards to whether DACA recipients’ information will be used for deportation purposes, something the current ORG secretary has urged against.
There’s a major problem with reading into PERSON’s remarks: By his own admission, he isn’t really in the loop on immigration policy yet.
“The entire development of immigration policy is ongoing right now in terms of the upcoming administration,” PERSON said at one point in the hearing. “I have not been involved in those discussions.”",1
1672,"The wall rhyme appears to fit into that same bull’s-eye category. The ORG press office did not respond to a request for comment about the origin of Mr. PERSON’s latest catch phrase on Wednesday. But a senior aide to the president said that Mr. PERSON came up with it himself, and credited the new slogan to his “marketing genius.”
There are a few hitches: Mr. PERSON’s rhyming sales pitch that a border wall will reduce crime is not credible, and the facts he uses to bolster his claims are often correctable.
First, despite the president’s repeated claims, construction has not yet started on the border wall: The “under construction now” in his morning tweet needs more context. ORG has begun or completed several projects to replace old fencing with new barriers, but no additional miles of wall have been added yet. Construction to build a new levee wall system in GPE is scheduled to begin in February, the first extension of existing barriers.
Second, Mr. PERSON’s rhyme that a wall will lead to falling crime rates may be catchy, but it’s at odds with what data shows about the influence immigration has on crime.
Law enforcement agencies rarely release crime data that includes immigration status, but several studies have found that immigration does not lead to an increase in crime. Others have shown that immigrants — including those who are undocumented — are less likely to commit crimes than native-born NORP.",1
1544,"“PERSON!” the children’s voices cry out, between sobs. “Papá!”

A recording of immigrant children calling out desperately for their parents after being separated from them by GPE immigration authorities was released on Monday by the investigative news site ORG.

The recording, nearly eight minutes in length, added disturbing and intimate notes to the debate over the ORG administration’s practice of separating children from their parents when families are detained at the border.

ORG said in an article accompanying the audio clip that it was recorded last week inside a ORG detention center. Ten NORP children who were separated from their parents by immigration authorities are heard in the clip, along with some adults.

The recording is one of a number of documents and accounts that have emerged in recent days showing the toll the practice is taking on children, even though government officials have forbidden journalists who tour the detention centers for migrant children from using cameras or conducting interviews with the children.

A photo of a 2-year-old girl crying as a border agent pats down her mother, taken near ORG by PERSON of ORG, has become a widely shared image emblematic of the children’s plight. On Sunday, ORG published an article about PERSON and her 8-year-old son PERSON, who were separated by NORP officials when they were detained after crossing the border together in May. Ms. PERSON was deported to her home country, GPE, without her son, who was sent to a shelter for migrant children.

Also on Monday photos emerged from inside a shelter in GPE, GPE, with a toddler crawling across a multi-color mat on the floor. She had been separated from her relatives and at the facility about a month, said the person who took the photo who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to release an image.

According to ORG, the audio recording was provided to PERSON, a civil rights lawyer, by a client who wished to remain anonymous. Ms. PERSON then provided the recording to ORG.

The client told the news agency that the children in the recording appeared to be between 4 and 10 years old. ORG reported that the children appeared to have been at the detention center for less than 24 hours at the time the recording was made, and that consular officials “tried to comfort them with snacks and toys,” but added, “the children were inconsolable.”

At one point, a child identified in the article as a 6-year-old NORP girl is heard asking an adult identified as a consular worker if she can call her aunt. “My mommy says that I’ll go with my aunt,” the girl says in LANGUAGE. “And that she’ll come to pick me up there as quickly as possible.”

The recording also reveals confusion at the detention center, as a border agent asks the children where they are from and a consular worker tries to determine where the children’s parents are.

What is unmistakable are the sounds of frightened children.

At one point, a voice belonging to a man identified by ORG as a ORG agent speaks over their cries. “Well, we have an orchestra here,” the man says. “What’s missing is a conductor.”",1
902,"Will hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants lose protection from deportation?

That decision is up to ORG, the ORG administration says.

Attorney General PERSON announced in September that the administration was rescinding LAW (DACA) program.

Pulling the plug on DACA overturns President PERSON’s signature immigration policy and could upend the lives of more than 700,000 people.

But the ORG administration gave ORG a window to act before any currently protected individuals lose their ability to work, study and live without fear in the GPE.

Here’s a look at some key questions about the program and its future:

Who’s been protected by DACA?
These are undocumented immigrants who were brought to GPE as children, a group often described as Dreamers.

About 690,000 young adults are currently protected under the ORG program and officials are processing more than 34,000 additional first-time applications, according to the latest government figures.

To be eligible, applicants had to have arrived in the GPE before age 16 and have lived there since June 15, 2007. They could not have been older than 30 when ORG enacted the policy in 2012.

Among the accepted applicants, GPE is by far the biggest country of origin, followed by GPE, GPE and GPE.

What does DACA do for them?
DACA recipients have been able to come out of the shadows and obtain valid driver’s licenses, enroll in college and legally secure jobs. They also pay income taxes.

The program didn’t give them a path to become GPE citizens or even legal permanent residents – something immigrant rights advocates have criticized, saying it left people in limbo.

How long does the deferral last?
Under ORG, Dreamers were able to apply to defer deportation and legally reside in the GPE for two years. After that, they could apply for renewal.

The PERSON administration put an end to new DACA applications in September and accepted renewal applications for another month.

Now officials say they aren’t accepting any more applications. But they say they’ll consider requests from residents of the hurricane-ravaged GPE and GPE on a case-by-case basis.

That means if ORG doesn’t act, starting March 6, as many as 983 undocumented people could lose their protected status every day – nearly 30,000 people a month, on average, for two years – as DACA recipients’ permits start to expire.

So what’s the administration planning to do?
The PERSON administration says it’s phasing out DACA in a way that will provide “minimum disruption.”

For current ORG recipients, protections remain in effect – for now.

According to officials:

• Work permits issued under ORG will be honored until they expire.

• New DACA applications that were received by September 5 and renewal applications received by October 5 will be processed.

What has ORG said about DACA?

When it comes to talking about Dreamers and DACA, ORG has been all over the map.

He vowed to dismantle the program on the campaign trail, but once he took office he suggested he might take a softer stance.

Even after his administration announced its plans to end the program, ORG seemed to signal a desire for ORG to step in and save it, tweeting: “Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really!”

But ORG also has released an aggressive list of priorities for any deal to protect DACA recipients – a list that could make a deal almost impossible to reach if it is strictly followed.

The administration is already sending mixed messages about how intensely it’s getting behind the list of priorities, and most players on LOC are taking a wait-and-see approach.

Is there any hope now for Dreamers?
Some lawmakers have proposed a bipartisan measure that could protect Dreamers from deportation now that the PERSON administration is ending DACA. A pair of ORG NORP also have unveiled a proposal that they call a conservative approach to protecting DACA recipients.

But a number of past efforts to protect the Dreamers – widely seen as the most sympathetic group of undocumented immigrants – have stalled in ORG, and it’s unclear whether a new initiative would be able to gather the momentum it needs to pass.

Why did the ORG administration decide to end DACA?
Over the summer, 10 state attorneys general wrote to the President asking him to end DACA and giving him a September 5 ultimatum.

Their message: Rescind DACA, or get prepared for a legal challenge from us.

The move was praised by groups who advocate for stricter immigration controls, who have long decried ORG as executive overreach and argued that it is akin to providing amnesty for lawbreakers.

Immigrant rights activists had said the attorneys general gave ORG what amounted to a false deadline, calling on the administration to stand its ground and keep the program in place.

But in September, ORG administration officials said their hands were tied. They described the program as unconstitutional and something they could not successfully defend in court.

Why are people called Dreamers?
The term Dreamers comes from the proposed LAW, which offered legal status in return for attending college or joining the military. It was first introduced in 2001. The latest version was voted down in the ORG in December 2010.

But the name stuck. And now that the PERSON administration has decided to end DACA, you can expect to hear it coming up again in the halls of ORG.

What information and fees were required for DACA?
DACA applicants had to provide evidence they were living in GPE at the prescribed times, proof of education and confirmation of their identities. They also had to pass background, fingerprint and other checks that look at identifying biological features.

The fee to request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals, including employment authorization and biometric services, was $495.

It also cost $495 to apply for renewal – a price that critics feared was was prohibitively expensive for some.

Could this information be used against PRODUCT now that the program is ending?
This is something immigrant rights advocates say they’re very concerned about and they’ve vowed to take steps to prevent it from happening.

ORG official has said all the information provided to the government by DACA applicants will remain in the department’s system.

ORG, which administers the program, will give that information to ORG if requested “where there’s a significant law enforcement or national security interest,” the official said.

Where do I find out more about DACA?
There are answers to more complex questions on the website of ORG. ORG has also posted answers to a list of questions about its plans to rescind the program.",1
1842,"Even as NORP and voting rights groups praised the sudden demise of President PERSON’s voter fraud commission on Wednesday, voting rights experts were raising alarms about the news that ORG would step into the breach.
ORG said Wednesday that dissolving the commission didn’t mean the administration was ending its focus on voter fraud. ORG will take up the baton. GPE Secretary of ORG PERSON (R), the vice chair of the now-defunct panel, told ORG that the department can take information collected by the commission and run it against an ORG database of non-citizens to identify people illegally on state voter rolls.
Voting rights groups had viewed the commission as nothing more than an attempt to gin up evidence to back ORG’s unsubstantiated claims about widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election. On Thursday, election lawyers, civil rights groups and other experts saw serious flaws in the ORG plan, too.
They noted that voter fraud does not fall with ORG’s expertise and that efforts to cross-match voting rolls with ORG data in the past have resulted in high numbers of people being incorrectly identified as non-citizens. Plus, the department has the power to deport people.
In 2012, GPE looked to ORG ORG database to help clean up its voter rolls. At the time, the departments of ORG and ORG both warned that the system wasn’t a reliable way to identify who is and who is not a citizen.
“The use of the immigration databases are inaccurate, discriminatory and inappropriate for voter list maintenance. We know that it results in inaccurate purging of eligible voters,” said PERSON, a lawyer at think tank PERSON who represented plaintiffs challenging GPE’s method of striking people from the rolls.
Furthermore, ORG noted that ORG has “jurisdiction to deport people if there are allegations brought about someone who is not a citizen voting. That’s very, very intimidating and that’s why I’m so concerned about these false allegations.”
Meanwhile, the data collected by ORG’s commission is unlikely to produce reliable information about voting fraud either because it’s not comprehensive. As of October, only 20 states had sent the commission their data and that information wasn’t standardized. The lack of precision raises the risk of false positives, especially if officials are inclined to find fraud.
“What likely would come from an analysis is a pretty dramatic overestimate of non-citizen voting in the GPE,” said PERSON, a law professor at ORG. “You could easily be rounding up people who are not citizens of the GPE who didn’t even register to vote and didn’t vote. ... These are people here legally, under our immigration programs, maybe on their way to citizenship, but just because of a bad match they are rounded up and deported.”
ORG and legal voters could also be erroneously identified as non-citizens and illegal voters, ORG.
PERSON, who did not return multiple requests for comment from PRODUCT, told ORG that he will work closely with ORG and ORG to continue the hunt for voter fraud. Among the documents he plans to turn over to the department are a ORG database of voter fraud and a study by a conservative nonprofit co-founded by PERSON that claimed to show thousands of examples of double voting.
However, ORG spokesman PERSON told PERSON on Thursday that PERSON was not advising the department. He declined to explain what particular issues the department would be probing.
“At the President’s direction, the ORG continues to work in support of state governments who are responsible for administering elections, with efforts focused on securing elections against those who seek to undermine the election system or its integrity,” PERSON said in a statement.
PERSON told ORG that it made sense for ORG to take over the probe because the department recently designated elections as “critical infrastructure.” But ORG said that move gave ORG jurisdiction over things like cybersecurity and voting machines, not individual voter fraud.
PERSON, who worked as deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs at ORG from 2003 to 2007, said he was surprised a voter fraud inquiry would wind up there. ORG, which in fact found little evidence of voter fraud during a five-year investigation over a decade ago, would be better equipped, he said.
“It’s outside the scope of the mission” of ORG, ORG told PRODUCT. “You’re never going to find the answer if [the investigation is] under-staffed and under-resourced.”
Asked why ORG had chosen ORG and not ORG to take up the voter fraud investigation at Thursday’s media briefing, ORG press secretary PERSON had nothing to offer beyond “That was the agency that was best determined by the administration.”
It may not be all that easy for ORG to get busy hunting for voter fraud. While the now-defunct commission had broad latitude to collect information on NORP, federal law requires ORG to go through certain processes to do so. If the commission were to simply hand over the voter roll data, that would likely invite further lawsuits. ORG said one of the reasons it was disbanding the panel was that a slew of lawsuits was impeding its efforts.
ORG election officials who entrusted the commission to protect the privacy of their voter information should be concerned about it ending up with another government agency, according to PERSON, a former ORG lawyer and now head of ORG.
“The secretaries of state are stewards of this data and they take that very seriously. I don’t know a single one that doesn’t. When you have data that was meant for voting purposes [being] repurposed for a law enforcement purpose by another agency, that would raise concerns,” he said.
ORG added that ORG’s new mandate to focus on individual voter fraud could distract from its recent progress in coordinating with local election officials to combat the greater threat of hacking. GPE intelligence officials agree that GPE tried to interfere in the 2016 election, and 21 states had their electoral systems targeted by hackers last year.
“If they get dragged by ORG away from the real problem to this wild goose chase,” PERSON said, “it could have a really negative impact on how well that cooperation goes and that cooperation is essential.”",1
