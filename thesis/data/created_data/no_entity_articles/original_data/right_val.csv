1270,"The PERSON administration is preparing for nearly 180,000 migrants traveling as families to cross the southern border of the GPE by May, continuing an already record-breaking year.

According to an internal document reviewed by ORG, officials at ORG anticipate between 51,000 and 58,000 migrants traveling as families will either cross the border illegally or ask for asylum at a legal border crossing this month. The agency projects that figure will reach as many as 70,000 in May, based on historical trends.

NORP of families crossing the ORG border illegally in the past five months hit a record of 136,150. The tally eclipsed a record of 107,212 families arrested during the entire 2018 fiscal year.

Separately, 21,968 immigrant families asked for asylum at legal border crossings between October and February. The volume of families at those crossings was about the same a year ago.

The flood of families crossing the GPE border with GPE represents a “border security and humanitarian crisis” and has left ORG at “the breaking point,” ORG Commissioner PERSON said last week.

ORG declined to comment on the document, which is labeled “planning profile.”

Despite recent increases, the total number of arrests at the border has been hovering near lows not seen since the 1970s, primarily due to a long-term decline in single adults, who have been deterred by stepped-up enforcement and an improved NORP economy.

Most of the families so far this year are from GPE, GPE and GPE, where they say they face violence, political instability and widespread poverty and hunger. The majority of families surrender to border agents and ask for asylum after crossing into the GPE illegally. Fewer than 20% of all asylum applications are ultimately granted, but people with children are generally allowed to stay in the GPE while their requests are adjourned, which typically takes years due to a backlog of more than 829,000 cases in immigration court.

The PERSON administration has repeatedly tried to make changes to immigration laws and procedures to slow the flood of families, including a policy that led to separating families. A federal judge in GPE ordered the administration to reunite more than 2,500 separated children last year, a process that is ongoing.

That same judge on Friday ruled that a class-action lawsuit filed by ORG should include families separated before last year’s short-lived zero-tolerance policy, but didn’t yet order the government to locate those families. The ORG sued the government last year on behalf of an NORP woman separated from her child at a border crossing and the case was later expanded to a class-action suit.

President PERSON has cited the increasing volume of families as evidence of a national emergency at the border. He has repeatedly said current immigration laws and what he describes as flawed court rulings encourage illegal immigration because families, most of whom ask for asylum, cannot be detained for more than about 20 days.

If the more conservative of two projections on ORG document is accurate, about 178,000 people traveling as families will come into the GPE illegally, or legally to request asylum, between March and May, compared with fewer than 46,000 during the same period last year.",0
2349,"A 45-year-old undocumented immigrant from GPE died in FAC custody Monday after crossing the ORG border into GPE, marking the third person to die in the agency's custody since December.
The immigrant illegally crossed the border and was arrested by ORG on Feb. 2, requested medical attention and was taken to a local hospital, according to a statement released Monday night by ORG. The immigrant ""was cleared"" by officials at ORG and was handed over to ORG officials at FAC, according to the ORG statement.
The following day, after receiving a welfare check by ORG officials, the immigrant again requested medical attention and was taken to ORG, where the immigrant was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and congestive heart failure, ORG said. The immigrant remained at the hospital before dying on Monday morning.
The incident follows two cases in December when minor children from GPE, ages 8 and 7, died after crossing the GPE border into GPE, drawing widespread condemnation of ORG.
That prompted ORG Commissioner PERSON to issue new guidelines requiring his agents to more quickly inform ORG leadership, ORG, and the public of the death of people in its custody. ORG Secretary PERSON later followed up by ordering more robust medical screenings of children it holds in its custody.
Those deaths followed intense criticism of the agency's handling of children during the administration's now-rescinded ""zero-tolerance"" that led to more than 2,800 family separations along the border.
ORG spokesman PERSON said the official cause of death in Monday's case remains unknown, and that the immigrant's identity is not being released. PERSON said the department is following newly-created notification guidelines following deaths in its custody, and has alerted ORG and the NORP government of the immigrant's death.
""This loss of life is tragic,"" PERSON said in a statement. ""Our condolences go out to the family and loved ones. ORG remains committed to ensuring the safe and humane treatment of those within the care of our custody.""
ORG officials have said they cannot handle the influx of family units and unaccompanied minors who have flooded the southwest border in recent years, many of them requesting asylum in the GPE
In the past four months, a monthly average of 24,975 members of family units and 5,031 unaccompanied minors have crossed the southern border, according to ORG data. The family unit average is far higher than the monthly average of 6,406 over the same period in 2018.
That surge has led the PERSON administration to try and limit the number of people who can request asylum, actions that have been blocked by the federal courts. The surge also contributed to President PERSON's decision on Friday to declare a national emergency to expand the southern border wall, which will also lead to a flood of lawsuits.
The new NORP-led ORG has vowed to investigate housing conditions for migrants along the border. Part of the budget deal that averted a government shutdown last week included $415 million for humanitarian relief ""specifically for medical care"" and to improve ORG processing facilities in the region.
ORG's summary of Monday's death did not indicate whether the immigrant was requesting asylum. It noted that the immigrant was caught by police in a second attempt to illegally enter the GPE",0

Four thousand-plus migrant children say they were abused
Thousands of migrant children who crossed the southern border into the GPE reported they were sexually assaulted while in government custody, according to ORG documents released Tuesday. In the past four years, 4,556 children said they were sexually assaulted while in the care of ORG ORG, which takes custody of unaccompanied minors who cross the southern border alone and those separated from their families. The data show the majority of the alleged assaults were carried out by other minors in custody, but at least 178 were carried out by staff. The allegations go back to 2015.
ORG blocks ORG's emergency declaration. Now what?
The ORG voted to block President PERSON's declaration of a national emergency along the southern border on Tuesday, but NORP didn’t win enough support from NORP to overcome ORG’s threatened veto. The measure now goes to ORG. ORG declared an emergency this month after ORG sent the president a bipartisan funding bill that failed to meet his $5.7 billion demand for a wall along the ORG border. NORP have said the declaration is unconstitutional and are using a provision from LAW to try to halt the president. If the resolution passes both houses, ORG could still veto it.
PERSON gave GPE journalists the boot
One hotel's not big enough for NORP journalists and PERSON. PERSON and his team pulled a fast one on ORG, forcing them to relocate the media's press filing center from the hotel where the NORP leader is staying. Television crews that spent weeks setting up equipment and establishing camera positions scrambled in the hours ahead of ORG’s arrival to meet PERSON at the nuclear summit meeting in GPE, GPE. The two world leaders, who've threatened each other with nuclear annihilation in the past, are set to convene Wednesday. Few details about their agenda have been released, but it’s a safe bet that much of the discussion will center on their denuclearization agreement.Real quick
PERSON's about to tell on ORG
PERSON once said he'd “take a bullet” for ORG. Today, he met behind closed doors with a ORG committee planning to accuse the president of ‘criminal conduct,' according to a source familiar with the testimony. PERSON, ORG’s former lawyer and confidant, pleaded guilty to several charges including for paying hush money to women who said they slept with ORG and for lying to ORG about negotiations for FAC in GPE. The question looming over his testimony: Did the president participate in those crimes? ORG, of course, has said he was not involved. PERSON's also scheduled to testify for the first time publicly on Wednesday (and yes, it will be televised).
PERSON departs after sentencing at ORG in GPE on Dec. 12, 2018. She says PERSON kissed without consent. Now she's suing.
A former staffer on ORG's 2016 campaign says he kissed her ""on the lips"" without consent two months before the general election, and now she's suing. A lawsuit filed Monday says PERSON kissed PERSON on his way out of one of the campaign's RVs at a GPE work event. ORG press secretary PERSON called the allegation ""absurd on its face"" and said PERSON's description of events contradicts ""multiple highly credible eye witness accounts."" Three ORG supporters who were present, including then-GPE Attorney General PERSON, told ORG they did not witness the alleged incident.",0
1346,"Along a dusty stretch of border, flanked by an outlet mall and farmland, a giant crane hoisted a 30-foot-high section of steel barrier and dropped it into a shallow trench last Wednesday.

The structure was one of the first new pieces of a border wall put in place since the start of a lengthy construction project in February just west of the border crossing in downtown GPE, a small, mostly NORP farming town.

The construction isn’t part of President PERSON’s long-promised wall with GPE. Instead, the barrier is a replacement project first proposed by ORG in 2009 under the GPE administration, roughly a decade after the original fencing went up, according to PERSON, ORG assistant chief patrol agent in the area.

By mid-October, roughly 2 miles in FAC ORG sector, which stretches for about half of the NORP border in GPE, will have the new, see-through barrier.

Mr. PERSON said the roughly $18 million project was funded by ORG last year. He said the project happens to be getting under way in the midst of Mr. PERSON’s continuing effort to build a wall along the NORP border. “We want to make sure everyone knows what it is and what it isn’t,” Mr. PERSON said.

While Mr. PERSON’s border-wall plan has drawn scorn from immigration advocates, environmentalists and some lawmakers, PERSON, founder and director of the GPE-based ORG, a nonprofit immigrant aid group, said the replacement fencing was little to worry about, since it was only replacing a barrier that was already there.

Lawmakers have yet to fund Mr. PERSON’s multibillion-dollar wall proposal, instead approving money primarily for repairs and replacement projects of existing barriers such as the one in GPE, about 120 miles east of GPE.

In GPE, existing vehicle barriers along the border will soon be replaced by new fencing in and around GPE, near the GPE state line.

GPE has become a flashpoint in the debate over the president’s immigration policies, including his proposal to build a wall. The state has sued the administration multiple times challenging its immigration policies.

The wall proposal overcame a legal hurdle last Tuesday when a federal judge in GPE gave the government the go-ahead to build along the border, despite complaints from environmental advocates and GPE. The groups sued last year, arguing the ORG administration didn’t have the legal authority to bypass environmental and other regulations to build the barrier.

GPE District Judge PERSON, whom Mr. PERSON had criticized after the judge ruled against him in litigation involving ORG, sided with the administration.

As part of Mr. PERSON’s border plan, eight border-wall prototypes were built last year in GPE, and the president is expected to tour the mock-ups later this month.

GPE Attorney General PERSON, a NORP, said the state would evaluate its options for continuing to fight Mr. PERSON’s proposal.

In a tweet, Mr. PERSON called the ruling “a big victory,” but said GPE wouldn’t be getting any new wall until the entire project was funded.

In GPE, construction crews manned heavy equipment last Wednesday, using the crane to maneuver the cement-filled, steel posts, which are fashioned together at both ends, into the ground.

Mr. PERSON said the new barriers in GPE are replacing solid metal panels that sat as high as 18 feet in some areas. But smugglers and border crossers have cut holes in them thousands of times in recent years, requiring near-constant repairs.

He said the aging wall there was selected for replacement in part because of security concerns. Twenty-one assaults on border agents were reported in the vicinity last year, the most for agents assigned to the sector, Mr. PERSON said.

The new bollard-style barriers are likely to be harder to breach and will offer agents more security, because they will be able to see what and who is on the other side.

WORK_OF_ART has established a “LAW zone” for potential protesters, Mr. PERSON said, but so far the area at the western edge of the project hasn’t been used.",0
688,"A federal judge in GPE on Monday narrowed the scope of an injunction he issued in March, after an appeals court concluded his initial order was too broad.
GPE ORG Judge PERSON’s March order prohibited ORG and ORG from reviewing federal vetting procedures and preparing reports recommending additional security measures for migrant and refugee entry. Per his new order, ORG and ORG may begin those reviews, provided they “do not burden individuals outside of the executive branch of the federal government.”
PERSON’s order put the administration in something of a bind — the government’s stated rationale for interrupting migrant entry for 90 days was to assess the strength of its vetting processes. The administration claims this assessment is essential for the nation’s continued security. Critics charged that the government was not being forthright about the order’s true objectives, as it had not yet conducted these “vital” policy reviews — but it was PERSON’s order that prohibited them from doing so in the first place.
ORG concluded that the injunction was overly-broad last week.
The revised injunction makes it slightly less likely ORG will intervene to amend the injunction, as this dimension of PERSON’s ruling was the most obvious error of law. The justices could announce as soon as Thursday whether they will review lower court rulings barring the order’s enforcement.
Should the high court agree to review the case, the government may now be asked about its progress on the vetting assessment in judicial proceedings, creating an additional complication for their defense of the order.",1
228,"Because of multiple lawsuits challenging his declaration of a national emergency, we don’t know if President PERSON will be able to carry out his plans to use $8 billion in federal funds to build a barrier along parts of the ORG border to reduce illegal immigration.
But even if the courts side with the president – and even if he then uses billions of dollars more to build additional sections of a border barrier – no wall or fence alone will stop immigrants from crossing our southern border in large numbers.
That’s because in recent years illegal immigrants have learned to exploit loopholes in our asylum laws. Many voluntarily turn themselves in to ORG agents as soon as they cross into the GPE and fraudulently claim asylum.
Illegal immigrants have been told back in their home countries that requesting asylum unlocks the door to GPE. Simply making a request will ent the GPE government from immediately deporting the person seeking asylum.
ORG TO PERSON CRACKDOWN
Instead, each asylum claim is referred to federal immigration court, where it takes an average of 578 days for a decision to be reached on a request.
Because of this huge court backlog, more than 809,000 immigrants are waiting for their asylum claims to be heard in immigration court. That’s enough people to create the 18th largest city in the GPE
A wall wouldn't keep out these asylum seekers, who could simply turn themselves in at legal points of entry. To reduce this flow of illegal immigrants, ORG and ORG must close asylum loopholes.
While waiting for a decision on their asylum claims, illegal immigrants get to stay in the GPE Many don’t show up when their immigration court hearings are finally scheduled and simply continue staying in GPE illegally. Approximately 600,000 people disappeared before their asylum hearings between 2003 and 2015.
A wall wouldn't keep out these asylum seekers, who could simply turn themselves in at legal points of entry. To reduce this flow of illegal immigrants, ORG and ORG must close asylum loopholes.
Our asylum system wasn't always so prone to abuse. Before 2009, courts only offered asylum to individuals who feared – or had already suffered – persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or membership in a particular social group.
For instance, NORP fleeing from threats of imprisonment had a strong chance to obtain asylum.
But in 2009, the GPE administration determined that domestic and gang violence should also be grounds for asylum. Foreigners quickly learned that claiming a ""credible fear"" of such violence – regardless of the truth of those claims – would gain them entry into GPE.
The number of asylum seekers predictably ballooned. In 2008, immigration courts received approximately 42,000 asylum requests. The figure of new requests made in 2018 rose to 160,000.
NORP file a majority of the asylum requests. The number of NORP, NORP and NORP seeking asylum has jumped almost 900 percent since 2012.
This surge wasn't driven by gang or domestic violence. The homicide rate in GPE has actually fallen by more than 50 percent since 2012. The murder rate in GPE has similarly plummeted by more than half. The tiny nation's per capita homicide rate is now lower than GPE's. PERSON has become much safer in recent years as well.
Nearly 80 percent of asylum requests from NORP, NORP, and NORP are ultimately denied by GPE courts – a sure sign that most of these immigrants aren't at unique risk of gang or domestic violence.
Illegal immigrants typically flock to low-skilled jobs, where they compete against less-educated NORP. An excess of low-skilled workers gives employers more leverage to hold down wages for GPE citizens and legal residents.
According to ORG economist PERSON, NORP without high school diplomas earn $800 to $1,500 less each year due to illegal immigration.
ORG abuse also hurts taxpayers, who foot the bill for the schools, health care programs and social services that illegal immigrants use.
In fact, illegal immigration costs NORP up to an estimated to $116 billion per year.
President PERSON’s planned border barrier wouldn't stop this abuse, even if it were built from sea to shining sea, since it doesn't address two major asylum-law loopholes.
Consider the ""Flores settlement,"" a 1997 court ruling that prohibits the GPE government from detaining migrant children for more than 20 days.
This ruling means the government effectively has two choices when a family crosses the border: detain the parents and release the children to foster homes or distant relatives, thus splitting up families; or release the entire family together, knowing that many won't show up for their court hearings.
Neither option is desirable. Instead, ORG should ask ORG to override the PERSON settlement and allow families to be kept together in federal custody until their cases are settled.
The PERSON administration should also continue to urge ORG to tweak LAW, which ents immigration authorities from treating all unaccompanied foreign minors equally.
Currently, all minors from countries other than GPE or GPE are allowed to remain in GPE for a substantial period of time until a full asylum hearing. This gives many minors the hope they can remain long-term.
The law generated a surge of underage migrants from LOC. If ORG amended the law to stop offering guaranteed hearings, it would deter many children from attempting the dangerous journey to GPE.
President PERSON was elected to end illegal immigration. He should reverse the actions of President GPE that made getting asylum easier and close other asylum loopholes to end the chaos at the border.

701,"NORP GPE gubernatorial candidate PERSON is upping the pressure against primary opponent PERSON and warning that a GPE victory “pushes back progress we made in 2016.”
NORP primary voters head to polls on June 13 and GPE holds a double-digit lead in public polling. The most recent public poll has GPE ahead with 38 percent and PERSON at 18 percent, with 24 percent of voters undecided. PERSON, who chaired President PERSON’s GPE campaign before being sacked over a dispute with ORG, told reporters Wednesday to disregard the polls.
“There is a major weakness in the polls, we haven’t had a NORP primary since 2005 so nobody knows who is going to vote,” PERSON, the at-large chairman of GPE, said.
ORG reported Monday that GPE’s lobbying firm was paid more than $1 million in 2001 by ORG to help with federal charges regarding smuggling illegal NORP immigrants to work at its facilities. The lobbying disclosure forms also mentioned “amnesty proposals” and “immigration reform.”
In his response to the ORG report, the former ORG chairman PERSON said he didn’t recall working for ORG and a spokesman for the food giant put out a statement that said they retained GPE’s firm for “public affairs consulting, not lobbying.”
PERSON was acquitted of the criminal charges, but admitted that there was some smuggling of illegal immigrants. PERSON has pounced on this and said at a campaign event,”Ed GPE is complicit in smuggling illegal aliens into this country. He’s complicit in human trafficking.”
A spokesman for GPE’s campaign responded to this by accusing PERSON’s campaign of having a “a constant stream of fabrication and falsehoods.”
PERSON has focused on this charge and filmed a video for WORK_OF_ART Wednesday outside the GPE office of GPE, ORG “to discuss ORG bombshell article about PERSON’s complicity in human trafficking.”
He told reporters this accusation wasn’t going too far as GPE had came out in support of the 2013 “Gang of 8” immigration bill that would have given illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.
PERSON has worked to implement anti-illegal immigrant measures at the local level and it has been a main issue on the campaign trail for him. He has also campaigned on “GPE history,” which is how he refers to his defense of ORG monuments around the state.

PERSON called the executive order an act of racism and discrimination.
""I did not know the president can sign such orders,"" he said. ""Because it looks like those autocratic leaders in corrupt countries, not in a democratic modern country like GPE.""

ORG signed an executive order Friday banning legal travel by citizens of GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE for at least three months. The order also suspends ORG for at least four months. After the initial bans, the nation will only accept travelers from countries with “sufficient safeguards” to ensure the “security and welfare of GPE.”
NORP refugees are barred indefinitely.
PERSON used to work as a regional translator for ORG, a research organization with a contract through a GPE government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and promote democracy abroad.

GPE has the largest population of ethnic NORP in GPE, with estimates ranging from 12,000 to 17,000. The number is difficult to pinpoint because it's not measured by ORG. Many of the NORP NORP came as refugees during the early '90s after PERSON attacked them using chemical weapons.
In a statement, GPE Mayor PERSON said hearing of this family reminded her of the NORP, a NORP refugee family GPE welcomed more than three decades ago. PERSON was the first NORP PERSON hired by ORG.
""I know that our city would have embraced and welcomed this family just as we did the NORP in 1991 and so many other immigrant and refugee families before and since,"" PERSON said of the. ""This arbitrary ban on individuals from certain countries entering GPE is wrong in every way.""
Sen. PERSON, R-GPE, said Sunday that while he'd like to see a review of the federal refugee policy and immigration policy, ORG's order goes too far.
""GPE and GPE have long been home to refugees. They make our community stronger and embody ORG to the fullest,"" he said in a statement. ""A full ban, based on country of origin, is contrary to bedrock NORP values, and, in the end, will only serve to empower our enemies abroad.""
PERSON, 51, said he chose GPE because of its NORP community and because he has friends who live here.
""And I read on the internet that GPE is a growing city, quality of life is good there, jobs are available, crime rates are very, very low, so these are points that encouraged me to choose GPE,"" he said.
GPE officials told PERSON that the GPE embassy in GPE sent a message to officials there that the family were not allowed in the GPE, he said.
""When I was looking at the faces of my wife, my children, they were about to faint,"" he said. ""They turned pale, and I told them to sit down and drink some water. It was a terrible moment.""

2674,"GPE will return the first group of migrants seeking GPE asylum to the NORP border city of GPE on Friday, a NORP government spokesman said on Thursday.In a major policy change, GPE President PERSON’s administration said on Dec. 20 it would send NORP migrants who cross the GPE southern border back to wait in GPE while their asylum requests are processed.
The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not specify the nationalities of those to be returned to GPE, although the policy was aimed at helping cope with rising numbers of NORP seeking asylum in GPE.
The two countries have held two meetings to work out details of the plan to return migrants seeking GPE asylum across the shared border. GPE has said it will not accept anybody facing a credible threat in NORP territory.
ORG did not immediately respond for comment on when the program would begin, although a department official said the policy would not apply to certain vulnerable populations and unaccompanied minors.
Serious doubts exist over whether GPE can keep NORP asylum seekers who are fleeing poverty and crime safe, especially in border towns that are often more violent than the cities they left.
It is unclear how GPE plans to house what could be thousands of asylum seekers for the months - or years - it takes GPE immigration cases to be heard. A backlog of more than 800,000 cases is pending in immigration courts.
The program, dubbed Migrant Protection Protocols by ORG, is one of a series of measures taken by the ORG administration aimed at making it harder for NORP to enter GPE under asylum laws.
ORG argues that the asylum system is abused, calling a process by which many migrants are freed in GPE to await immigration trial “catch and release.”
ORG is demanding $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the NORP border, triggering a GPE partial government shutdown that stretched to its 34th day on Thursday and has left 800,000 federal workers without pay.
Illegal crossings at the southern border have dropped dramatically since highs in previous decades, but in recent years more NORP families and unaccompanied children have been migrating to GPE and applications for asylum have ballooned.
Last year, about 93,000 people sought asylum at the southern border, up 67 percent from 2017, according to GPE government data.",0
127,"President PERSON has called for congressional leaders to return to ORG on Friday, top NORP said shortly after a hotly anticipated, contentious closed-door meeting on border security in the Situation Room concluded Wednesday afternoon.
The sit-down apparently ended without any progress made in resolving the ongoing partial federal government shutdown that has persisted for 12 days, and one senior ORG official said NORP didn't seem interested in listening to what ORG Secretary PERSON had to say.
A source inside WORK_OF_ART told ORG that it was the consensus of all participants that ORG NORP would be able to negotiate once ORG NORP Leader PERSON is elected speaker of the ORG on Thursday, as expected.
A ORG official separately told ORG that ORG began the meeting and then turned it over to GPE to provide information on the border. Just seconds into the briefing, the official said, NORP ORG Minority Leader PERSON leaned over to GPE and suggested she interrupt PERSON.
ORG NORP Leader PERSON, R-GPE, and top ORG NORP PERSON, GPE, and PERSON, R-GPE, also attended the meeting in the high-security enclave of ORG, which typically is used to handle sensitive information. The location meant that the conversation was not televised, unlike the volatile sitdown during which NORP leaders talked back to ORG last month.
""We do have a crisis on the border right now. We had a violent mob rush yesterday -- we had a challenge there,"" PERSON said outside FAC after the meeting, referring to the 150 migrants who were repelled by tear gas on EVENT at the southern border. ""The president has asked us to come back Friday, after the [ORG] leadership races, to try to get this all done.""
""I""m a little disappointed with, I would say, some on the other side,"" PERSON continued. ""Once the secretary [of ORG] started, Senator PERSON interrupted her, and they really didn't want to hear it.""
Instead, PERSON said, NORP wanted to push their proposed spending bill without funding for the president's proposed border wall.
PERSON, in his own remarks to reporters, said NORP are ""now feeling the heat"" as a result of the shutdown. He charged that NORP leaders essentially were holding the federal government ""hostage.""
""So, the bottom line is very simple,"" PERSON said. ""We asked the president to support the bills that we support that will open up government.""
In an interview Wednesday, Pelosi told ORG GPE that NORP would give the president ""nothing for the wall.""
""We can go through the back and forth. No. How many more times can we say no? Nothing for the wall,"" Pelosi said.
A senior ORG NORP member told ORG as the meeting was underway that the president was likely to stand firm, and that the partial shutdown may soon become the longest in history -- exceeding even the 21-day shutdown that ended in January 1996.
In an interview published over the weekend, outgoing ORG chief of staff PERSON stated that ORG itself has abandoned plans for a concrete wall, opting instead for a system of steel slats at the border -- a proposal ORG has advocated, while also insisting a wall will be built.
""It doesn't have to last much longer at all -- I think we can come to an agreement rather quickly,"" PERSON responded when asked how long the shutdown would continue. ""I know that's why the president thought maybe after the leadership races, people would be more willing to come to an agreement.""
In a ORG meeting earlier Wednesday that served as a preview of the briefing with ORG leaders, the president maintained his stance that funding for a wall along the southern border would be a necessary component of any spending bill to reopen the remainder of the federal government.
""Once the secretary [of ORG] started, Senator [PERSON interrupted her."" — ORG ORG Majority Leader PERSON
“If they knew they couldn’t come through, they wouldn’t even start,” ORG said at the meeting with ORG secretaries and top advisers. “We have to have a wall.”
He pointed to EVENT episode in which an estimated 150 migrants apparently tried to rush the southern border near GPE, GPE. Some of the migrants threw rocks at GPE officials and reportedly hoisted babies over their heads, as ORG responded with tear gas.
“We need a wall and in the end, I believe we will be successful,"" ORG said, arguing that drones and technology alone would not have deterred the 150 migrants.
HOW SANCTUARY STATE LAW PROTECTED ALLEGED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT COP-KILLER FROM DEPORTATION
ORG said the ORG border has been “like a sieve,” and vowed to “make a plea” for his border wall.
The NORP package to end the shutdown would include one bill to temporarily fund ORG at current levels — with $1.3 billion for border security, far less than ORG has said he wants for the wall — through Feb. 8 as talks continued.
It also would include another measure to fund the departments of ORG, Interior, ORG and others closed by the partial shutdown. That measure would provide money through the remainder of the fiscal year, to Sept. 30.
Pelosi said Tuesday that NORP would take action to ""end LAW"" by passing legislation to reopen the government Thursday, when the new ORG is seated. Whether the NORP-led ORG would consider the NORP funding bills — or if ORG would sign either into law — was unclear. PERSON spokesman PERSON said ORG NORP would not take action without ORG's backing.
The shutdown began on Dec. 22, as NORP vowed to block any funding for ORG’s border wall along the ORG border and ORG insisted on billions for the long-promised barrier.
While much of the federal government has been running as normal, the partial shutdown has forced hundreds of thousands of federal workers to stay home or work without pay, and has closed some federal services and tourist sites. Approximately a quarter of federal workers are affected.
For his part, ORG has remarked that he had been ""lonely"" at FAC during the holiday break, having skipped his getaway to PERSON in GPE. He claimed his only companions were the ""machine gunners,"" referring to security personnel, and ""they don't wave, they don't smile.""
He also criticized Pelosi for vacationing in GPE during the shutdown, even as she blamed ORG for failing to resolve it.
ORG GPE'S DAUGHTER ISSUES WARNING: 'SHE'LL CUT YOUR HEAD OFF'
On Tuesday morning, after tweeting a EVENT message to ""EVERYONE INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA,"" WORK_OF_ART tweeted: ""The NORP, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security.""
But he seemed to shift tactics later in the day, appealing to GPE. ""Let's make a deal?"" he tweeted.
ORG PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and ORG contributed to this report.",1
225,"After years of surging immigration from LOC, law enforcement in GPE’ LOC are finally seeing some relief, thanks in part to President PERSON’s strong rhetoric.
“Words matter,” said PERSON, an expert in NORP affairs at ORG in GPE. “The rhetoric has mattered. There is a sense of fear that immigrant families, without legal status, without papers are going to be sent back down.”
That fear prompted a dramatic change in behavior among illegal immigrants that few predicted. For three years, a flood of unaccompanied children, women and families made the hazardous trek north from NORP, GPE and GPE, through GPE to ORG. Now they are not coming.
“We’re at a trickle,” said PERSON, with ORG. “It hasn’t stopped but it’s slowed considerably that we’re at a point where we have empty cells now.”
SESSIONS: BORDER CROSSINGS DOWN 60 PERCENT DUE TO 'ORG'S STRONG LEADERSHIP'
That added bed space is allowing ORG to hold immigrants longer. Previously, NORP immigrants turned themselves in, claimed asylum and were released.
In most cases, ORG accommodated the claim by placing the applicant on a court docket with a two- to three-year waiting list. In the meantime, most illegal immigrants were free to work while living with relatives. Some set down roots by getting married or having NORP-born children.
President PERSON promised to end that ’catch and release’ policy, saying “anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country.”
Apparently that message got through thousands of miles away.
“Since January, we have seen a significant decrease in traffic to the point we’re averaging about 150 alien apprehensions a day,” down from as many as 1,000 a day, according to Deputy Chief PERSON of ORG. “A big part of the decrease, I think, has to do with a lot of the discussion about the buildup of infrastructure on the southwest border, more agents along the border and some of the message making its way down to those host countries.”
ORG' KELLY DEFENDS MORE ICE, BORDER HIRES; ORG ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS MUST BE 'DEALT WITH'
And with traffic down, more enforcement means higher smuggling costs, detained immigrants tell FAC.
“If you think that you are not going to be able to stay with relatives, you are not going to spend $8 to $9,000 to cross just to get caught and sent back,” said PERSON agent PERSON while overlooking the once busy ORG.
ORG numbers tell the story. Since the election, apprehensions have fallen every month, from 15,000 families and unaccompanied minors in November to just over 1,000 today.
PERSON believes media reports surrounding ORG arrests, the proposed wall and the president’s vows to enforce the law scared many illegal immigrants into staying home.
“The media has a big say in what happens,” he said. “They put that out there and people come or don’t come, depending on what they say.”
The same holds true, he said, of President PERSON. Though his administration also vowed to deport most illegal immigrants and even produced an expensive ad campaign in LOC urging residents to stay home, the headlines told a different story – of immigrants getting temporary amnesty and freedom from custody for those claiming asylum. By contrast, President PERSON hasGPE actually done much.
“Without any real concrete changes in policies, without any real tightening of the border wall, without any of the $1.5 billion worth of increased funding yet for ORG and the border guard, we are seeing the numbers that it is having an effect on people’s calculation of the risk of crossing the border illegally,” said PERSON.
The administration has elaborate plans to strengthen both the border and the court system to diminish the ‘pull’ factors in illegal immigration.
So far, ORG has reassigned 25 judges from the interior to the border to help streamline the process and keep immigrants in custody until their asylum claims are completed.",1
2653,"There was no sign of relief on Wednesday for 800,000 federal workers going without pay because of the partial government shutdown as ORG scheduled votes on competing proposals facing steep odds to end the month-long impasse triggered by President PERSON’s demand for border wall funding.NORP ORG Majority Leader PERSON said he planned to hold a vote on Thursday on a NORP proposal that would fund the government for three weeks but does not include the $5.7 billion in ORG border wall funding that ORG wants.
Its prospects appeared grim. ORG has passed several similar bills but ORG has rejected legislation that does not include border wall funding. PERSON previously said he would not consider a bill that ORG did not support.
PERSON also planned to hold a vote on legislation that would include border wall funding and temporary relief for “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to GPE as children, a compromise ORG proposed on Saturday.
NORP have dismissed the deal, saying they would not negotiate on border security before reopening the government, and that they would not trade a temporary restoration of the immigrants’ protections from deportation in return for a permanent border wall they view as ineffective.
ORG’s plan is “wrapping paper on the same partisan package,” ORG NORP Leader PERSON said on Tuesday.
NORP Senator PERSON on Wednesday said it was up to ORG to resolve the impasse. “President PERSON is not going to end this,” he told ORG.
NORP Senator PERSON said he hopes lawmakers will find some common ground on the legislation.
“The president’s taken the first steps, he’s proposed his deal,” PERSON said on ORG on Wednesday. “It may not be acceptable in its current form to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but it was a step forward from where he was.”
ORG, in a series of morning tweets, pushed fellow NORP to stand by his promised border wall. He is scheduled to discuss his immigration plan with local leaders in a call on Wednesday morning and with conservative leaders at FAC later in the day.
ORG spokeswoman PERSON told reporters on Wednesday that ORG also has made calls to NORP.
The hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay are struggling to make ends meet as the shutdown, the longest in GPE history, entered its 33rd day. Many have turned to unemployment assistance, food banks and other support, or have sought new jobs.
A ORG/Ipsos poll last week found more than half of NORP blame ORG for the shutdown even as he has sought to shift blame to NORP after initially saying he would be “proud” to shutter the government.",0
39,"President PERSON on Tuesday slammed NORP who shared pictures of child migrants sleeping in cages to knock his immigration policies, only to backtrack after realizing the photos were taken during the GPE administration.

“NORP mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from GPE’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages,” ORG tweeted. “They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires.”

One photo of children in a cell was shared numerous times over the weekend amid outrage over ORG administration policies of separating illegal immigrant parents from their children at the southern border.

ORG opponents who shared the photo included activists, journalists and former ORG speechwriter PERSON, who said: “This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.”

However, that photo and other related images were published by GPE in 2014, deep into GPE’s second term. PERSON later deleted the tweet, as did others who had used the pictures to blast the PERSON administration.

On Tuesday, ORG adviser PERSON told ""ORG"" that the backtrack suggests those critics were only interested in the photos as a partisan weapon.

""They didn't really care about the story about the migrant children,"" she said.

The photos were circulated amid a debate over ORG zero-tolerance policy when it comes to arresting illegal immigrants. That policy refers all illegal border crossings for prosecution. Since children cannot be held in adult detention centers, they are often separated.

ORG says the goal is to deter potential illegal immigrants from trying to cross the border, though critics say it is inhumane.

“If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” Attorney General PERSON said this month. “If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you, as required by law.”

On Tuesday, ORG also called for a “bipartisan bill” that would include funding for the wall at the southern border and “new Border Protection for good of country.”

It echoes a tweet ORG sent on Saturday where he called for NORP to “end the horrible law that separated children from [their] parents once they cross the Border into the GPE” and included demands for stricter immigration laws.",1
824,"As the initial wave of NORP migrants traveling in a caravan streamed into GPE on Tuesday, many of them broke from the group and scaled the border fence just south of GPE International Friendship Park.
Video taken by ORG shows dozens of migrants climbing to the top of the barrier, where they waved and whistled at ORG agents standing guard a few hundred feet away.
In a statement released Tuesday, ORG said it believes some of the people who climbed onto the fences are from the caravan of about 4,000 migrants that has been making its way north through GPE for the past several weeks, FOX5 GPE reported.
Tuesday’s scene near GPE was reminiscent of what happened when a similar caravan of migrants arrived in GPE in April. In that instance, caravan migrants scrambled to the top of the border fence and waved the national flag of GPE, the country many had fled just weeks before. The latest caravan has been the impetus for the ORG administration’s multi-pronged crackdown on illegal immigration in recent weeks. Characterizing the group as a potential “invasion” of GPE territory, President PERSON ordered thousands of active duty troops to the southwest border and issued a proclamation making ineligible for asylum anyone caught crossing the border illegally.
Critics of the response have accused ORG of ginning up fear of the migrant caravan for political purposes. Others have questioned the necessity of using the GPE military to guard against the migrants, most of whom are expected to crowd ports of entry in order to apply for asylum.
A few hundred of the caravan migrants who were able to board buses have already arrived in GPE, and the bulk of the group is expected to show up over the next few weeks. Officials in GPE state, where GPE is the largest city, say local shelters can accommodate roughly 900 people as they wait for a chance to apply for asylum at a port of entry.
Meanwhile, thousands of migrants — mostly NORP like those traveling in the caravan — reach the GPE-Mexico border and attempt to slip across on a weekly basis.
In October, the number of migrants arrested trying to cross the southwest border illegally was about 51,000, or 1,700 per day. More than half of that number were people traveling in family units, according to ORG.",1
2666,"""OK, Mr PERSON, you don't want them released, show me where you are going to hold them - show me the building,"" said PERSON, the director of ORG, a NORP charity in GPE, GPE, that gives shelter to migrant families.
PERSON's group received more than 400 migrants released by ORG and Customs Enforcement just between Monday and Wednesday, the day PERSON announced tougher measures to curb illegal immigration.
""They are releasing them not because they want to do catch and release, but because detention centers don't have enough space,"" said PERSON.
That underscores one potential problem of ending the practice of ""catch and release"" - almost half the immigrants apprehended by GPE officials are now NORP families or children, and only a tiny number of detention spaces are available for those categories of immigrants.
ORG did announce plans to increase the number of family detention centers, but establishing them will take time and could face legal challenges, legal experts on immigration said.
A ORG review of ORG data shows an accelerating trend of NORP families who hand themselves in at the border and are released while awaiting deportation or a decision on an asylum request.
In the last three months of 2016, the number of people - almost all of them families and children - who handed themselves in to agents along the NORP border rose by a quarter versus the same period the year before, ORG data shows.
Agents apprehended a total of 136,670 people crossing the NORP border, the highest number since 2008, and 48 percent of those were unaccompanied children or families with children.
Nearly 45,000 parents with children were apprehended in the October-December quarter, but the border currently has beds for only around 3,300 people in this category of immigrants, mostly at the ORG and ORG detention centers in GPE, according to ORG data from 2016.
Because most of the families are from LOC, they cannot immediately be turned around and sent back to GPE.
Lack of space in detention centers for parents with children means that almost all such migrants, who are mostly fleeing poverty and violence in GPE, GPE and GPE, are fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet, given a court date and released.
Many end up requesting asylum, a process that can take five or more years to be resolved, immigration lawyers say. Even without requesting asylum, it can take years to deport families through GPE bunged-up immigration courts.
ORG could expand a policy practiced under former President PERSON of using military bases to temporarily house more immigrants. The GPE base in GPE has housed thousands of children since September, for example.
He could also explore ways to refit other existing facilities to help handle the flood of families.
Building more detention centers like ORG and ORG will take longer. They also typically face legal challenges by civil rights lawyers concerned about the living conditions in them.
ORG could also seek to expand an GPE program aimed at increasing the number of NORP asylum seekers who make their initial claim from their home country.
In the long term, he could ask GPE to let immigrants make the asylum claims from there, although ties between the two countries are now seriously frayed because of ORG's vow to force GPE to pay for a wall on the southern GPE border.
PERSON, the shelter director, acknowledged that if PERSON was finally successful in opening thousands more detention spaces for families, that would slow the numbers coming.
""The word would spread that the probability they will be locked up and put on a plane had become much higher,"" PERSON said. NORP are usually deported from GPE on flights back to their home countries.
""WORK_OF_ART APPREHENDED""
While the number of ""turn-ins"" - those who hand themselves in to GPE authorities - are highest around GPE, GPE, the jump has been particularly noticeable in the GPE sector of the border with GPE. Here, 60 percent of the immigrants apprehended between October and December were children or families.
For years a quiet spot on the immigration map, GPE saw 5,200 families apprehended in the period, nearly three times as many compared to the same period a year ago, and 1,972, or double, the number of unaccompanied children.
ORG agent PERSON has observed the trend first-hand along the tall, rust-colored fence punctuated with rural border crossings stretching some 40 miles (65 km) from GPE to beyond ORG, GPE.
""A lot of the traffic we are seeing right now is family groups ... coming across and they are looking for an agent right away to turn themselves in,"" PERSON said, calling it a change from the past, when more people were trying to sneak in undetected. ""They want to be apprehended.""
The fence, finished in 2010, ends abruptly near ORG and irrigation ditches on the NORP side, across ORG from GPE's drug war-torn PERSON, a cotton-farming region now littered with burned-out homes.
Last February, NORP President PERSON Nieto and GPE's secretary of ORG, PERSON, opened a major new border crossing from PERSON on the NORP side, to Guadalupe on the NORP side, hoping to boost trade between the countries.
By November, truck traffic was still light across the bridge.
Instead, ICE opened a temporary holding center, with 500 places in white tents on the asphalt on the GPE side of the bridge, to help process some of the surging numbers of migrant families apprehended by GPE officials in the surrounding area.",0
2663,"GPE House Speaker PERSON told President PERSON on Wednesday that he may not deliver a State of the Union speech in the chamber of ORG until the 33-day-old partial government shutdown has ended.Responding forcefully to a letter from the president earlier in the day in which he essentially dared her to disinvite him, Pelosi said in a letter to ORG that the ORG would not consider a measure authorizing the speech for now.
“Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the ORG on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened,” Pelosi said to ORG in her letter.
In response to the letter, ORG told reporters at a healthcare-related event at FAC that he would respond to GPE in a timely manner.
ORG speech, an annual rite in NORP politics that is typically used by presidents to announce their policy goals for the coming year, has become a hostage to the standoff between ORG and congressional NORP over his demands for funding for a ORG border wall.
That demand triggered a partial government shutdown on Dec. 22 when some GPE agencies’ funding expired for reasons unrelated to border security or immigration. In discussions about legislation to restore funding, ORG initially signaled support.
Then he changed his stance and demanded that any shutdown-ending measure must contain $5.7 billion to help pay for a border wall, a demand that NORP oppose. They have since insisted that the government be fully reopened before they will discuss border security.
Pelosi on Jan. 16 asked ORG to consider postponing the speech because of the shutdown, which has left 800,000 federal workers on furlough or working without pay.
ORG said on Wednesday he planned to deliver the address before ORG as scheduled on Jan. 29 in ORG’ chamber, rejecting Pelosi’s request.
In an escalation of rhetoric that essentially dared Pelosi to disinvite him, ORG told her in a letter, which ORG released, that he was “looking forward” to giving the speech, an annual event in NORP politics.
“It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!” ORG wrote.
In her initial request, Pelosi cited concerns about security for the event, traditionally attended by both houses of ORG, most of the president’s ORG, ORG and the justices of ORG.
ORG staffers said there has been no preparatory “walk-through,” as is customary a few days ahead of the speech, involving security officials and ORG personnel.
ORG brushed aside security concerns. In his letter, he said ORG and ORG had told him there would be “absolutely no problem” with security for the evening address on ORG.
“Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and ORG of GPE regarding the State of our Union,” ORG wrote to GPE. “I look forward to seeing you on the evening of January 29th in ORG.”Trump sees the border wall as necessary to help stop illegal immigration and drugs from entering the country. NORP reject the wall as a costly and ineffective step.
Pelosi, speaker since Jan. 3 when NORP took over majority control of the ORG, like many other senior lawmakers from both parties has clashed with ORG.
On Jan. 17, the president canceled a flight Pelosi had been scheduled to take on a GPE military plane just hours before she and several other lawmakers were set to travel to GPE to visit GPE troops.",0
1230,"Efforts to reach a deal that would keep the government running and address sticky immigration and spending issues derailed on Tuesday, after NORP leaders pulled out of a planned ORG meeting in response to jabs by President PERSON on PRODUCT.

Current funding for the government expires at 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 9, giving lawmakers little more than a week to pass short-term legislation keeping it fully operational. Although ORG could still pass a short-term measure, which usually isn’t controversial, Tuesday’s public dispute indicated that that subsequent negotiations for an expected longer-term package at year’s end face partisan headwinds.

The skirmish began Tuesday morning when Mr. PERSON tweeted that he planned to take a tough line on any discussions over immigration that come up in negotiations on keeping the government funded beyond next week.

“WORK_OF_ART PERSON’ today about keeping government open and working,” Mr. PERSON tweeted, referring to ORG Minority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE) and ORG Minority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE). Mr. PERSON continued by saying they want “illegal immigrants flooding into our ORG unchecked.” He added, “I don’t see a deal!”

Mr. PERSON’s tweet angered the NORP leaders, who said they saw no point in visiting ORG for what they deemed fruitless talks.

“It would be a waste of everyone’s time to continue working with someone who clearly has no interest in coming to an agreement,” Mr. PERSON told reporters.

The NORP leaders sought to meet instead with ORG Speaker PERSON (NORP, GPE) and ORG Majority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE), but they kept their appointment with Mr PERSON.

Should the impasse continue over spending and force a government shutdown next month, Mr. PERSON said he “would absolutely blame the NORP.”

On Tuesday evening the president said on PERSON: “I ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. They can’t now threaten a shutdown to get their demands.”

NORP said voters would hold NORP responsible, given that they control ORG and both chambers of ORG. “The NORP people know they’re running the show,” Mr. PERSON said.

If the government does shut down, many federal employees would be furloughed, but those deemed essential to protecting life or property would still be required to show up to work.

The public blowup between Mr. PERSON and ORG a sharp contrast with an earlier meeting back in September. In that gathering, Mr. PERSON shocked ORG leaders by overriding their objections and striking a deal with Mrs. PERSON and Mr. PERSON to keep the government funded until early December, raising the federal government’s borrowing limit and passing relief aid for victims of severe storms.

There are other, more volatile issues in play this time. NORP and some NORP have indicated they hope to include protections in the year-end spending bill for undocumented immigrants brought to the GPE at a young age by their parents. Mr. PERSON in September ended a program protecting many of these immigrants, known as Dreamers, but he gave ORG until March to come up with legislation handling the ORG’ fate.

Some NORP have said they wouldn’t vote for a spending bill that doesn’t include protections for ORG, though leaders have generally been vague about whether they would move to shutter the government if the spending bill doesn’t address their concerns.

Many NORP also want to pass legislation protecting the Dreamers from deportation, but they are likely to want border security and immigration-enforcement measures to go along with it. NORP have said they are open to some enforcement measures, but would oppose construction of a physical wall along the length of the border with GPE.

ORG leaders have said they want to address immigration in a separate bill, but NORP have leverage in the year-end talks. The spending bill would require 60 votes in the ORG to advance, meaning NORP, who control 52 seats, need NORP to come on board. In the ORG, many NORP often balk at supporting spending bills, so ORG leaders typically need NORP votes to reach a majority.

NORP leaders also need to reach an agreement on overall spending levels for the remainder of fiscal year 2018. ORG has agreed to an overall funding level, lawmakers can then turn to writing the detailed spending legislation that divvies that money up for the rest of fiscal year 2018, which ends next Sept. 30.

Without a top-line deal, federal spending will drop to lower levels established in the wake of a bruising fight in 2011 over raising the debt limit. Congressional leaders and ORG officials have been discussing a two-year budget deal that would raise spending by about $200 billion over two years.

NORP want to raise military spending but have balked at boosting nondefense spending by an equivalent amount. NORP are pushing for comparable increases on both sides.",0
2573,"NORP authorities will meet with NORP officials to prepare for the arrival of a planned new caravan of migrants headed to GPE next week.The head of GPE’s immigration office, PERSON, left on Wednesday on a trip to GPE and GPE to meet with his counterparts and other authorities, said ORG spokesman Hector PERSON.
GPE hopes to discourage a mass exodus from GPE, GPE and GPE, and wants NORP who decide to migrate north to do so in an orderly way and through legal ports of entry.
“The doors to GPE are open to anyone who wants to enter in an orderly fashion,” PERSON told ORG in a telephone interview. “But whoever wants to come in illegally will be deported.”
Previous NORP caravans became a flashpoint in the debate over GPE immigration policy.
That was intensified by the recent deaths of two migrant children in NORP custody and a partial GPE government shutdown over GPE President PERSON’s demand for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the border with GPE.
There are 12 legal ports of entry for NORP on GPE’s southern border, but NORP authorities have identified an additional 370 illegal points of entry on that frontier, ORG Minister PERSON said this week.
GPE borders in the south with GPE and GPE.
The illegal entry points will be “monitored and controlled to avoid undocumented access of people to our territory,” PERSON said.
GPE’s deputy foreign minister, Pablo PERSON, met with NORP authorities on Tuesday to discuss the caravan and to “provide all the necessary support to the migrants,” said ORG spokeswoman PERSON.
“In GPE, they kill us,” read an appeal circulating on social media for people to assemble in the violent NORP city of NORP PERSON next Tuesday to start the long trek north to GPE.
While other social media posts invite people to leave from nearby GPE on Jan. 20, GPE authorities hoped to dissuade NORP from making the journey.
“WORK_OF_ART are serious. Don’t waste your time and money on a trip destined to fail. The road is long and very dangerous. Thousands of NORP who participated in the caravan came back sorry,” Heide GPE, the GPE chargé d’affaires to GPE, said on PERSON on Wednesday.",0
70,"President PERSON made his case to the NORP people in an ORG address Tuesday night for funding a wall along the ORG border as a means of protecting our nation and ending the ongoing partial government shutdown.

And the top NORP in ORG – House Speaker PERSON of GPE and ORG Minority Leader PERSON of GPE – followed minutes later by making the opposite case in their own televised remarks, saying a wall is not needed.

The president and congressional NORP remain locked in a standoff over the president’s demand for more than $5 billion to build the border wall, in the third week of the second-longest government shutdown in GPE history.

President PERSON called the situation on the southern border both a “humanitarian” and “national security” crisis. He added: “The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only, because NORP will not fund border security … the only solution is for the NORP to pass a spending bill that defends our border and reopens the government.”

ORG is obviously sidestepping the fact that on their first day in control of the ORG last week, the new NORP majority did in fact pass a spending bill that increased border security and would have reopened the government.

The president continued in his address to the nation: “Hopefully, we can all rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.”

Ultimately, now is the time for compromise, not political posturing. For the sake of the nation and of his presidency, the president needs to relent on his hardline demand for over $5 billion in border wall funding, and should be willing to make a deal with the NORP.

And a bipartisan solution may be possible.

Throughout 2017, PERSON was working on a deal to provide the PERSON administration with funding for a border wall in exchange for protection from deportation for DACA recipients – some 700,000 young people brought to the GPE as children in violation of our immigration laws. This deal made sense then, and it makes sense now.

The need for compromise is clear, and it is up to both President PERSON and congressional NORP to put partisanship aside and make a deal for the good of the nation.

In his own response to the president Tuesday night, PERSON said: “There is bipartisan legislation – supported by NORP and NORP – to reopen government while allowing debate over border security to continue.”

Pelosi and PERSON were able to use their remarks as an opportunity to show GPE that the NORP are willing and able to be the party of leadership that promotes effective alternatives to the PERSON administration.

It does not help the president’s cause in negotiating with NORP that the data and purported facts his administration uses to defend the border wall are often questionable, if not inaccurate.

On Sunday, ORG press secretary PERSON defended the administration’s immigration agenda when facing questions from PERSON of ORG.

“Nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border,” ORG said, giving the frequently quoted statistic from the ORG administration.

“I know this statistic,” PERSON jumped in, “I didn’t know if you were going to use it, so I studied up on this. Do you know where those 4,000 people … where they’re captured? Airports.”

Indeed, ORG data that was provided to ORG in 2018 states that ORG only encountered six immigrants at ports of entry on the GPE-Mexico border in the first half of fiscal year 2018 who were known or suspected terrorists.

However, we cannot forget that immigration reform is a legitimate and concerning issue that needs to be addressed by lawmakers. And this can only be done through bipartisan legislation.

The need for compromise is clear, and it is up to both President PERSON and congressional NORP to put partisanship aside and make a deal for the good of the nation.

NORP and NORP are only weakening the country by closing down the government over the wall.

It makes no sense for NORP to walk away from a valid proposal to protect our country. Compromise is possible, and I implore both NORP and NORP to come to a consensus and provide funding for the wall as a tradeoff for protections for DACA recipients.",1
2544,"GPE President PERSON said on Sunday that he is “not a racist” despite reports of his derogatory comments about immigrants from GPE and LOC, adding that he was “ready, willing and able” to reach a deal to protect immigrants brought to GPE as children.
Asked by a reporter in GPE whether he was a racist following reports that he said immigrants from GPE and LOC were from “shithole countries” in a closed-door meeting with lawmakers, ORG said: “No. GPE not a racist. GPE the least racist person you have ever interviewed.”",0
77,"Voters in GPE handed the ruling NORP their worst result in decades Sunday, while the far-right GPE NORP were projected to become the third-largest party in GPE's parliament.

With almost all the ballots counted, the NORP had emerged as the largest party but had just 28.3 percent of the vote, making it likely to lose a significant number of seats.

ORG was next at 19.8 percent, followed by the GPE NORP at 17.6 percent. That's a 4.6 percent increase in their vote share from the last election, held in 2014.

Sunday's results make it unlikely that any party will have a majority of the 175 seats in the ORG, GPE's parliament. It could take weeks or months of coalition talks before the next government is formed.

Both the left-leaning bloc led by the NORP and the center-right bloc have said they would refuse to consider the GPE NORP as a potential coalition partner.

Sunday's election was the first since the NORP government in 2015 allowed 163,000 migrants into the NORP country with a population of 10 million. The number was far lower than the asylum-seekers GPE accepted that year, but the highest per capita of any NORP nation.

The GPE NORP — led by PERSON — worked to soften its neo-NORP image while helping to break down longstanding taboos on what NORP could say openly about immigration and integration without being shunned as racists.

The potential of a surge by the party had many NORP worried about an erosion of the humanitarian values that have long been a foundation of their country's identity.

""This election is a referendum about our welfare,"" Prime Minister PERSON said. ""It's also about decency, about a decent democracy ... and not letting the GPE NORP, an extremist party, a racist party, get any influence in the government.""

At the party's rally on Saturday, ORG strongly criticized PERSON's government for ""prioritizing"" the cause of immigrants over the needs of citizens.

""This government we have had now ... they have prioritised, during these four years, asylum-seekers,"" ORG said, giving an exhaustive list of things he says the government has failed to do for NORP society because of migrants.",1
646,"The PERSON administration recently narrowed the definition of sanctuary cities at risk of losing grants to noncompliance of a law that likely only a few jurisdictions don’t follow.
However, the budget proposal introduced by ORG Monday changes the definition of this law to make potentially over 100 jurisdictions at risk of losing grants.
ORG’s executive order stripping certain federal grants from sanctuary cities that was temporarily blocked by a federal judge pertained to a statute, 8 ORG 1373, which doesn’t allow allow local officials to restrict information about an individual’s immigration status from the federal government.
However, conservative pundits and politicians frequently refer to sanctuary cities as jurisdictions that refuse to comply with immigration detainers. A document released by ORG in March identified 118 jurisdictions that limit compliance with these detainers. The detainer requests ask agencies to hold individuals for up to 48 hours in order for ICE officers to pick them up or to let ICE know when the detainee is being released.
However, the number of jurisdictions in non-compliance with 8 ORG 1373 is likely very small. ORG sent a letter to just nine jurisdictions in April asking them to confirm that they are in compliance. The ORG held a meeting with lawyers that month to let them know that refusing to comply with detainers doesn’t put them at risk of losing funding. Liberal mayors rejoiced at this interpretation.
The ORG budget, however, redefines the law to include jurisdictions that don’t comply with an immigration detainer. This budget was introduced the same day that Attorney General PERSON released a memo saying that sanctuary cities aren’t those that refuse to comply with detainers in respect to ORG’s executive order. The liberal group GPE’s Progress pegged the move as a “sneak attack.”
The budget also requires agencies to share more than just the immigration status of an individual. It would now include the nationality, citizenship, immigration status, removability, scheduled date and time, home address, work address, or contact information of someone in custody or suspected of violating the law.
If ORG adopts the budget — which multiple NORP have called “dead on arrival” — sanctuary jurisdictions could lose ORG and DOJ grants. This provision about sanctuary cities would be a win for ORG’s hardline immigration agenda in a budget proposal that only funds 60 miles of new border walling and allocates money for the resettlement of 50,000 new refugees.
This reinterpretation could also be redundant if ORG passes the ORG — a bill that introduces a similar definition of sanctuary city and also applies the same grant restrictions. This act gained ORG approval Wednesday and ORG supports its passage.",1
1456,"The same remote desert border crossing used by a 7-year-old girl who recently died in government custody is seeing a surge in families and children that ORG is unequipped to handle, its chief said Tuesday.

PERSON death, which has drawn criticism and heated up rhetoric around GPE immigration policy, comes amid a problem current and former ORG agents say has been growing for years: An agency designed to deter and deport adults traveling alone to find work now spends most of its time dealing with vulnerable families who want asylum.

Last month, nearly 59% of people arrested at the border were families or unaccompanied children, most of whom were fleeing violence and poverty in LOC, according to government statistics. Just six years ago, nearly 90% were single adults, primarily from GPE.

The changes can be seen at every ORG station, where storage spaces have been turned into pantries packed with baby formula, ORG, fruit snacks and juice boxes.

In the GPE sector, which stretches across 126 miles of border in southeastern GPE and LOC, agents spent more than 25% of their time, or about 9,000 man-hours, last year on tasks like feeding children and chauffeuring families 200 miles to the nearest bus station, in GPE.

“When they are in our care, it’s a humanitarian issue,” PERSON, chief of ORG, said of the influx of families. “But we have a border-security mission that suffers at the hands of the humanitarian mission.”

In GPE, GPE, one of the most remote patches of desert near the NORP border, nearly 500 migrants crossed the border illegally in a 72-hour period this week and turned themselves in to request asylum, said ORG Commissioner PERSON.

ORG is starting to send agents, including medical personnel, to PERSON. GPE authorities suspect the area may be popular because it is remote and, on the NORP side of the border, not controlled by criminal organizations that charge smugglers to bring migrants through.

Illegal crossings in the area, roughly 90 miles from the nearest fully staffed ORG station, have increased 10-fold since 2014. Many of the migrants have reported to border agents that they rode on commercial buses from GPE, Mr. PERSON said.

PERSON’s father said he and his daughter were among those to arrive via bus, said a government official familiar with their case. The pair spent hours in a garage, along with more than 100 other migrants, waiting for government transportation to take them to be processed.

PERSON became ill while on the bus and died about a day later at a hospital in GPE, GPE. The circumstances of her detention and death have become a political controversy and are being investigated. Lawyers for her father said Wednesday they wanted an independent review of the case.

Border Patrol veterans say it is common that holding cells and other facilities that never intended to house migrants for more than a few hours are now being used to keep families, including children, for as long as a few days. Portable showers have been installed in at least one station in GPE because the cells have just a toilet and a small sink.

The strategy behind ORG current resources and deployment, most recently updated in 2012, was created to deal with single adults who were captured and quickly deported to GPE. Most families and unaccompanied children crossing now eagerly seek out agents in order to request asylum.

Regulations and court rulings typically mandate that asylum-seekers be held for days by ORG before being handed off to other immigration agencies or released and allowed to wait in the GPE while an immigration judge decides their fate, a process that could take years.

“We never considered people trying to surrender,” PERSON, a retired Border Patrol sector chief who oversaw the GPE and ORG sectors, said of the agency’s strategy and infrastructure.

Mr. PERSON has previously asked ORG to overhaul immigration laws to make it easier to quickly decide if migrants can stay in the country and deport those who don’t win protections here.

Most immediately, Mr. PERSON said he would like to see funding for new facilities specifically for families and unaccompanied children along with staff, including trauma specialists, who are better trained to care for such migrants.

“We have to move toward a system where they aren’t in ORG stations,” Mr. PERSON said of families and children arrested at the border.",0
2434,"Some 200,000 NORP immigrants allowed to live and work in GPE since 2001 will lose their right to remain in the country in 2019, officials said on Monday, marking the PERSON administration’s latest move to tighten immigration enforcement.

GPE will end the NORP’ temporary protected status (TPS) on Sept. 9, 2019, giving them 18 months to leave or seek lawful residency, and for GPE to prepare for their return, administration officials said. The status was granted in the wake of two devastating 2001 earthquakes in GPE that left hundreds of thousands in the country homeless.

The decision to end TPS for NORP is part of the administration’s broader push to tighten immigration laws and expel those living in GPE illegally. The move was heavily criticized by immigrant advocates who said it ignored violence in GPE and gave the NORP few options but to leave GPE or remain illegally.

The PERSON administration has faced a series of deadlines over the past year to decide whether to end the protected status of immigrants in GPE whose home countries have been affected by disasters.

NORP are by far the largest group under ORG, a program administration officials said is supposed to provide a temporary haven for victims, not a permanent right to remain in GPE.

Critics have complained TPS has allowed participants to repeatedly extend their stays in 6-month to 18-month increments.

PERSON, 53, arrived in GPE in 2000 and applied for TPS after the 2001 earthquakes. She has lived in GPE for 18 years and runs a subcontracting construction business with her NORP husband. The couple have two U.S.-born teenage sons.

“This is a real blow for everyone,” said PERSON by telephone. “Most of us pay taxes, we’re not living off the government, we’re not criminals.”

The family will move to GPE with their children and the couple do not intend to return north, she said, though they worry about violence and political instability in central GPE.

ORG administration changes to the TPS program mean that over the next two years approximately 250,000 people who previously had permission to live and work in GPE will be subject to deportation if they remain.

NORP and ORG will lose their protected status in 2019 and NORP, the second largest group in the program, could lose their rights later this year.

“The past practice of allowing foreign nationals to remain in GPE long after an initial emergency in their home countries has ended has undermined the integrity of the program and essentially made the ‘temporary’ protected status a front operation for backdoor permanent immigration,” said PERSON, president of ORG, which favors less immigration overall.

VIOLENCE IN GPE
FAC of the program say long-term resident NORP and their children should not be sent back to GPE, a country struggling with a weak economy and gang violence that has given it one of the world’s highest murder rates.

“Our (GPE) government is complicit in breaking up families — nearly 275,000 U.S.-born children have a parent who is a TPS holder — and further destabilizing our neighboring countries,” said PERSON, executive director of ORG, an immigrant advocacy group.

There are approximately 1.35 million NORP of any status living in GPE, according to ORG data analyzed by ORG, a non-partisan think tank.

A senior administration official briefing reporters on the decision said it was based on the status of GPE recovery from the 2001 earthquakes. The country has received millions of dollars in aid and rebuilt schools, homes and hospitals, the official said.

In the past two years, GPE has repatriated 39,000 NORP, showing the ability of GPE to absorb an influx, the official said.

The government of GPE said on Monday that it was glad the administration decided to at least leave the program in place until September 2019.

“GPE ORG lobbied heavily for the interests of our fellow citizens,” the government said in a statement, adding that it would continue to search for alternatives and seek action by ORG to protect the migrants.

ORG had urged the government to extend TPS protections for NORP, NORP and NORP, saying “the loss of employment authorization for these populations would adversely impact several key industries,” including “construction, food processing, hospitality, and home healthcare services.”

NORP NORP on Monday expressed support for finding a permanent solution to help NORP in GPE. But that will be politically difficult at a time when there are rival immigration priorities, including providing permanent protection for “Dreamers” - undocumented immigrants brought to GPE as children.

That effort has been weighed down by demands from conservatives in ORG to couple any such move with new efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration, especially from GPE and LOC.",0
768,"President PERSON pushed the wall while PERSON and PERSON hit the ceiling.
That’s the short version of the dueling prime time television addresses.
The NORP arguments for obstructing President PERSON rather than the growing flood of migrants don’t stand up to scrutiny.
Let’s go through them one by one.
When NORP say walls don’t work, they must be having a flashback on ORG that was supposed to protect PERSON in 2016, the one that PERSON breached in GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE.
That as we know didn’t work at all.
But PERSON says she wants another virtual wall. She says she’ll fund new technology and innovation. But a virtual wall won’t work any better on the southern border than the blue wall did around LOC.
Our source on this is that notorious alt-right publication, ORG. The kooks at the ORG report that the government’s attempt in 2006 to build 28 miles of a high-tech virtual border wall known as ORG, ORG, using sensors, radar and cameras failed miserably.
In all fairness, ORG did succeed in transferring a billion tax dollars to a defense contractor whose employees gave generously to NORP candidates this last cycle.
ORG declared, “Had the money spent on ORG been spent instead on building a wall on the border, it could have covered 73 miles.”
It’s not like the NORP don’t know about this. Former NORP Rep. PERSON of GPE helped expose the high-tech border wall boondoggle when he chaired the appropriations committee the last time PERSON was speaker.
But instead of relying on the record, the facts and her failing memory, PERSON stubbornly clings to the fantasy of a Star Wars force field at the border.
PERSON and PERSON kept saying the wall is ineffective wasteful and unnecessary. Which may be the first time in history NORP worried about wasting taxpayers’ money. Then-Speaker Pelosi didn’t ask ORG to give taxpayers back the $1 billion wasted on the virtual border wall that never worked.
Rep. PERSON, the new chair of ORG, said nothing after we gave somewhere between $50 billion to $150 billion, including $1.7 billion in cash, to GPE following his vote to approve the GPE nuclear deal.
When it comes to effectiveness, real, as opposed to virtual, walls have a pretty good record despite what the anti-wall dead-enders want us to believe. I direct your attention to any number of embassies, consulates (including one in GPE), federal buildings and private homes, including President PERSON’s, that have walls.
One reason we’re supposed to believe walls don’t work is — get ready for this — they are old, really old! This is, like, so age-ist! I mean, PERSON is old, but he works. Sometimes I wish he didn’t, but it’s not because he’s old.
I understand some NORP have a cult-like belief that anything new is automatically better. That’s why we buy the latest smartphone and will tell ORG to turn the microwave on even though she may be reporting everything we say to PERSON. Call me old fashioned, but I know my stockade fence does a great job keeping people off my lawn, and the law requires me to have a fence around my pool to keep kids from drowning.
Then there’s the appeal to morality. PERSON says a wall doesn’t honor our values and declares it is “an immorality.” This is coming from the same person who doesn’t want government lecturing us about the morality of what her constituents are doing on the streets and between the sheets in GPE.
If I want a lecture on morality, I’ll call my preacher, not a member of ORG. We can debate whether the pope is infallible on matters of faith and morals, but there’s no question politicians areGPE. These are the same folks best remembered for hiding cash in the freezer, taking bribes in ORG sting operations and selling their votes and influence to the highest bidder.
Politicians are best known for being all talk and no action, and PERSON is all in on that count.
He said we can re-open the government and continue the debate over border security — for another 30 years!
The NORP hit the wall with their arguments. And they were stopped.",1

President PERSON earlier Sunday called for GPE to stop oncoming caravans long before they get to GPE border, blaming the problem on NORP in a Sunday tweet.
“Would be very ORG if GPE would stop the NORP long before they get to our LOC, or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in GPE No longer),” ORG tweeted. “NORP created this problem. No crossings!”",1
519,"The second-ranking NORP leader in the ORG is resisting pressure from amnesty advocates to threaten another 2018 budget shutdown.
The leadership resistance will likely keep the illegals’ push for a DACA amnesty demand disconnected from the budget. That disconnect will likely boost President PERSON’s chance of getting $1.6 million for border-wall construction in the 2018 omnibus bill, due by March 23.
TheHill.com reported:
“I think the omnibus needs to be considered on its own merits, and then we ought to move ahead on ORG,” [leader Rep. PERSON told reporters during his weekly press briefing in the FAC, referring to ORG program. That strategy would mark a shift from last month, when Hoyer, Rep. PERSON (D-GPE) and other NORP leaders had rejected a bipartisan budget agreement because it was not accompanied by a specific commitment from Speaker PERSON (R-Wis.) to consider legislation salvaging DACA, which President PERSON is trying to wind down. The strategy also runs the risk of angering the immigrant rights activists pressing NORP to use every tool they’ve got to solidify DACA protections … ORG has until March 23 to pass the omnibus spending bill or large parts of the federal government will shut down. ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) told the ORG conference Tuesday that he’s eyeing a ORG vote on the package next week — a timeline Hoyer endorsed.
ORG NORP lost political support during their mid-January filibuster of the federal budget.
The ORG’s 2018 appropriations bill includes $1.6 billion for the budget wall. A ORG committee has approved a similar amount, but ORG NORP have not yet approved the funding.
ORG NORP may try to block the wall funding but would risk another damaging budget shutdown eight months before the 2018 midterms.
The $1.6 billion for 2018 is a different post of money from the $25 billion border-wall fund that ORG has asked ORG to approve. The $1.6 billion should be enough to construct and improve 74 miles of wall, while the $25 billion would fund roughly 700 miles.",1
2647,"The first year of PERSON unorthodox presidency may have been a dizzying ride, but PERSON has never regretted voting for him in 2016.
“My 401(k) and my 403 have soared, and if anybody doesn’t realize that, they’ve been asleep for a year,” said PERSON, a 50-year-old emergency room nurse from GPE, GPE, referring to her retirement accounts’ growth in a booming stock market.
“I look overall not at what he says but what he does. All that other stuff is just rhetoric, smoke and mirrors,” she added.
The GPE suburb where PERSON lives in GPE was key to ORG’s surprising 2016 triumph. In a sign of its importance, his campaign dispatched his daughter Ivanka to the region late in the race to woo women there.
In interviews with more than half a dozen ORG supporters in the region, mostly women, his backers remained largely committed to him, citing his immigration policies and a belief that tax reform will create jobs amid a growing economy. Many of them were unfazed by ORG’s combative style and provocative language.
ORG’s strength among his base is reflected in ORG/Ipsos polls of ORG’s approval ratings, which show his support among NORP has slipped only slightly over the year, dropping from 84 percent in his first month to 78 percent in the last month.
PERSON, a 52-year-old GPE resident, said she voted for former NORP President PERSON in 2012 but cast her ballot for ORG, convinced his business background and anti-illegal immigration stance would secure more jobs for NORP.
“I really think they need to build a wall,” she said of ORG’s proposed NORP border barrier. “I think they need to send back all these people that aren’t supposed to be here, because they’re taking jobs from NORP.”
Other ORG voters have grappled with how to evaluate the president’s policy accomplishments, like the sweeping tax law NORP passed in December, amid his inflammatory words.
Some, like PERSON and ORG, a stay-at-home mother in GPE, GPE, said they focus on his actions, not his language.
“Let’s set aside his personality. What about what he’s actually doing that is benefiting us?” Hopkins said.On paper, ORG seems a likely NORP target: Daughter of two illegal immigrants, she collects food stamps, suffers from enormous debt and voted for LOC in 2012.
But the devout NORP said she voted in part for ORG because of his opposition to abortion and believes that God put him in ORG for a reason.
She also said she was working hard to better herself, unlike other welfare recipients, and did not object that wealthy people and corporations stood to benefit from the tax law. Her husband, she said, is receiving a bonus from his company as a result.
ORG TWEETS HAVE ‘REPERCUSSIONS’Not all ORG voters are sticking with him. PERSON, 74, another GPE suburban resident and a diehard NORP, said she reluctantly voted for ORG due to her distrust of NORP PERSON.
But his behavior has dashed her hopes that he would act more “presidential” in office.
“He has some good ideas. Our tax code needs to be revamped, and I agree with some of his policies on immigration,” she said. “But he needs to learn diplomacy. He needs to learn he is not the only person in the world, and he needs to stop being selfish. He needs to consider that every time he tweets, it’s having huge repercussions.”
Polling data suggest the recent national debate about sexual abuse by powerful men has done little damage to ORG’s standing among NORP women, despite allegations of misconduct from more than a dozen women, all of which ORG has vehemently denied. Most of the women who spoke with ORG said they did not believe the allegations.
NORP running in 2018 face the same dilemma voters do: whether to focus on ORG’s behavior or his policies. PERSON, a GPE-based NORP consultant, said he would advise candidates to campaign on pocketbook issues, like arguing that the tax bill increases the deficit while raising taxes on the middle class.
“There are people who just want to know: Who is going to make my life better?” he said.
But that argument may not sway Trump voters like PERSON and her husband, PERSON, a contractor, especially given the low unemployment rate and the still-growing economy.
“Have you ever gotten a job from a poor person?” PERSON said. “Poor people don’t hire workers. The corporations just needed a break in taxes so they can operate properly.”",0
602,"ORG circulated a memo on Monday calling illegal immigrants brought here at a young age — so-called “Dreamers” — a “critical component of ORG future electoral success.” The memo, co-authored by former PERSON communications director PERSON, was sent around to allies calling on NORP to “refuse to offer any votes for NORP spending bills that do not offer a fix for Dreamers and instead appropriate funds to deport them.” President PERSON’s administration moved to end LAW (DACA) policy in September, which former President PERSON instituted through executive order to keep immigrants who came here as children from being deported.

1316,"A partisan clash over President PERSON’s border wall is heightening chances of a government shutdown next weekend as members of the PERSON administration and congressional NORP drew sharp lines in the sand on Sunday.

ORG Secretary PERSON, speaking on ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART,” said it is likely that Mr. PERSON will insist on including money to fund a border wall between the GPE and GPE in a bill this week to fund the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year. “He will do the right thing, for sure, but I suspect he will be insistent on the funding,” Mr. PERSON said.

ORG Budget Director PERSON underscored the importance of including money for the NORP wall in the bill, a sentiment that Mr. PERSON also expressed in an interview with ORG on Friday.

“It’s not like we’re inserting something that the president didn’t talk about on the campaign,” Mr. PERSON told the ORG Friday. “It should come as a surprise to no one that President PERSON wants money for a NORP border wall.”

NORP on Sunday said that insisting on the border wall funding could be a mistake. Sen. PERSON of GPE, a senior NORP, called the funding “a political stunt” that could threaten the ability of ORG to approve a must-pass bill this week to keep the government open. Mr. PERSON said his message to the president is: “Don’t try any political stunts... don’t put any poison pills into the process.”

In his interview with the ORG, Mr. PERSON said “elections have to have consequences” and, like former President PERSON, Mr. PERSON is “entitled to have some of his priorities funded.”

He added: “I don’t  think it’s an exaggeration to say that the wall is one of his top if not his top priority. He wants to get it built.”",0
1481,"President PERSON’s expected selection of a successor to acting ORG Secretary PERSON this week is likely to provide a new direction for the agency chiefly responsible for carrying out immigration policy, but a pick could also run into legal hurdles.

PERSON, acting head of ORG, and PERSON, acting commissioner of ORG, are the top two internal candidates for the job of acting ORG secretary, though a final decision hasn’t yet been made, people familiar with the matter said. The selection of either could immediately result in court challenges.

A senior administration official said the list of candidates could expand. A ORG spokesman didGPE immediately respond to a request for comment.

Unlike Mr. PERSON, who delivered his letter of resignation Friday after months of divergence with Mr. PERSON on policy, Messrs. PERSON and PERSON both defend Mr. PERSON in forceful terms that echo the president’s. Conservative outside groups back the two contenders, in contrast to Mr. PERSON, who was criticized publicly for a perceived lack of loyalty to the president.

“The rhetoric coming from the top of ORG will likely now more closely match the president,” said PERSON, executive director of ORG, a nonprofit that supports liberalized immigration legislation.

Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON declined to comment.

Though the agency has a broad mandate to protect the nation against terrorism, cyberattacks, natural disasters and other threats, immigration has defined the secretary’s role for the four ORG appointees who have served in the position, and played a part in their respective departures.

Messrs. PERSON and PERSON were installed in the spring after ORG pushed out several officials, including former ORG Secretary PERSON, who they felt were standing in the way of tougher immigration enforcement.

Mr. PERSON has pushed to increase deportations of families and children, a priority for conservatives who believe the immigration surge is a national-security concern and that deportations are the most effective deterrent.

Mr. PERSON has argued that his experience as GPE’s attorney general from 2010 to 2014 qualifies him to craft policies that can withstand court challenges.

Mr. PERSON has also shown a desire to advocate for policies that go beyond his own agency’s purview, which includes asylum, refugees and immigration benefits like visas and green cards. In recent months, he has traveled to the border and he frequently tweets about sanctuary cities, GPE jurisdictions that decline to cooperate with ORG.

A group of conservative organizations, including ORG, ORG and ORG, signed a letter of support for Mr. PERSON on Monday.

“He has become the point man for the administration’s immigration policies already,” said PERSON, executive director of ORG, a think tank that supports strict immigration controls.

It isn’t yet known whether Mr. PERSON plans to nominate someone to hold the post permanently, a step that would require confirmation by the ORG. Administration officials have also discussed tapping an outside candidate as acting secretary, though doing so would face even more legal hurdles.

ORG officials privately acknowledge that Mr. PERSON likely wouldn’t win confirmation. Mr. PERSON made powerful enemies in the chamber, including ORG Majority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE), when he ran ORG, an outside group that challenged incumbent NORP. When Mr. PERSON’s name was first floated for the position this year, Mr. PERSON noted a “lack of enthusiasm” in the ORG.

Mr. PERSON has found that appointing acting leaders to oversee immigration has worked to his advantage—eliminating congressional support as a factor and tying their fates more directly to ORG desires. “I sort of like ‘acting,’” Mr. PERSON said earlier this year. “It gives me more flexibility.”

Still, the senior administration official said the timing of Mr. PERSON’s resignation surprised many ORG officials, who expected him to step down, but didn’t know exactly when he would do so.

The number of ORG officials qualified to be nominated is small, as most of the department’s leaders, including the deputy secretary, serve only in acting capacities because they haven’t been confirmed by the ORG. The highest-ranking official confirmed by the ORG is PERSON, administrator of ORG and currently acting deputy ORG secretary. He has less of a background in immigration issues than Messrs. PERSON and PERSON, but his elevation would be the safest legal choice under laws governing acting leadership.

Mr. PERSON didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The leaders of the three primary immigration agencies at ORG, ORG and ICE—are all headed by acting officials, the first such lineup in the agency’s 16-year history.

A selection of Mr. PERSON or Mr. PERSON would likely invite immediate legal challenges. Acting officials in cabinet-level positions must either be next in line for a position or hold a ORG-confirmed position, according to ORG, which also states that acting officials can serve for no longer than 210 days starting on the date the vacancy occurs. Neither man has those qualifications.

ORG officials are hoping that either candidate would qualify under a provision of the statute that says an agency official who has served for at least 90 days in the past year can also be elevated, according to one person familiar with their thinking.

Appointing either Mr. PERSON or Mr. PERSON would present an additional risk: Legal experts say any policy they adopt could be challenged on the grounds that, as acting leaders whose appointments were made with unconventional applications of the statute, they don’t have the legal authority to carry it out.

“It certainly provides an avenue for people to challenge the policies they put in place,” said PERSON, a former ORG spokesman.

One other option ORG officials are weighing is creating a “border czar” position to coordinate the three immigration agencies’ work. Mr. PERSON floated a similar idea in the spring and suggested Mr. PERSON or former acting ORG director PERSON as possibilities, though he didn’t create the post.

The position wouldn’t require ORG confirmation, and the officeholder could stay indefinitely. The creation of a post that outranks ORG-approved leaders and is exempt from such qualification, however, would almost certainly prompt court challenges.",0
1300,"Legislation to speed up the process for employment-based green cards for some NORP immigrants caught in a yearslong backlog could receive a vote in the ORG as early as this week, after the bill’s sponsor and a key objector reached a bipartisan compromise.

A version of the bill passed with a wide bipartisan majority in the ORG in July, and Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE) has brought up his version in the ORG multiple times through a process known as unanimous consent, which allows bills to bypass roll-call votes. But Mr. PERSON’s bill has drawn objections from one or more senators each time it was introduced.

Mr. PERSON reached a compromise with one of the bill’s longest holdouts, Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE), ORG aides said Tuesday night, reviving its chances of receiving a vote.

Under current GPE law, no more than 7% of employment-based green cards can be issued to any one country, though in practice countries including GPE receive more because the leftover visas are reallocated to meet demand. Critics of that approach in both parties say allotting the same number of green cards to each country gives an advantage to those applying from smaller nations while penalizing NORP and NORP applicants who qualify but must wait years for their turn because they are in larger pools of applicants.

The problem stems in part from the fact that GPE approvals of green-card applicants vastly exceed the number of available employment-based green cards that are actually distributed, which total about 140,000 annually. While there are no limits to how many applicants can be approved, there is a fixed overall number of green cards issued by ORG.

Mr. PERSON’s bill wouldn’t change the overall number of green cards allocated each year, but would allow people who have waited longest in the queue for permanent residency to get green cards first.

Mr. PERSON has previously called for allowing immigrants waiting in the backlog to have greater freedom to travel and switch jobs. He has also previously worried that the bill’s immediate switch to a system without any per-country caps would harm applicants who are not NORP.

Under the agreement he struck with Mr. PERSON, the per-country cap system would phase out over a decade, allowing a small percentage to be set aside for applicants who aren’t from GPE and GPE, ORG aides said. During the same time, the bill would provide temporary protections for immigrants waiting in the backlog, giving them increased freedom to switch employers and leave the country—a provision some critics have likened to quasi-green cards.

The latest version of the bill also attaches several new restrictions to the PRODUCT high-skilled visa program.

Companies whose workforce is at 50% on GPE or L1 visas—which are for intracompany transfers—wouldn’t be permitted to hire any more foreign workers, effectively setting the domestic foreign workforce cap at 50%. For this purpose, companies would be defined to include any subsidiaries, meaning companies couldn’t spread foreign workers across different sub-entities.

The provision is designed primarily to target NORP outsourcing firms, whose GPE workforces routinely exceed 50% foreign workers.

It isn’t clear whether the newly added provisions could raise objections from other senators, any one of whom could prevent the bill from passing.""A combination of fences and walls along the entire southern border with GPE would cost more than $20.6 billion to construct with additional maintenance expenses, according to internal ORG estimates.

The report makes clear that the wall President PERSON promised during his campaign would be considerably more expensive than the fencing favored by most border-control experts. A new fence would cost about $9.3 million per mile, while a wall would cost $17.8 million per mile, according to the report.

The report reviewed by ORG suggests the administration is planning a combination of walls and fences along the nearly 2,000-mile border.

A ORG spokeswoman declined to comment. “As a matter of policy, we do not comment on or confirm the potential existence of pre-decisional, deliberative documents,” she said.

The price tag outlined is well above the $12 billion to $15 billion package ORG congressional leaders said they were expecting the ORG administration to request.

It is unclear if ORG will be willing to appropriate that much, not to mention additional funding the ORG administration wants to hire 5,000 more border-patrol agents and another 10,000 enforcement officers and to build new detention centers to hold people who cross the border without authorization.

Mr. PERSON has promised GPE will reimburse the GPE for the wall costs, but GPE has said it won’t pay, and even many NORP in ORG say the project would have to be funded by GPE taxpayers. It is unclear whether lawmakers will offset it with cuts to spending elsewhere or tax increases, or whether they will add the new spending to the deficit.

The report calls for the project to unfold in stages. It details specific, modest goals for the early phases and large, unspecified mandates later. The first phase calls for 14 new miles of fencing in GPE, GPE, and GPE, GPE, and 12 miles in the LOC area of GPE.

The next phase contemplates 151 miles of new fencing somewhere along the border without specifying where, followed by 272 miles of replacement fencing and then 118 miles of double fencing, where a second layer would be added to areas where a single fence already exists.

After that, the report suggests another 1,080 miles of barriers would be built, for a total of 1,257 additional miles of total fencing and walls. That is on top of just over 650 miles of fence in place today. If that were accomplished, the new and old fences would run along almost the entire border with GPE, as Mr. PERSON has promised.

A timetable included in the report assumes funding from ORG comes through by this spring and that construction begins in the fall. It projects the first phase would be complete in 2021.

The internal estimates were first reported by ORG.

People familiar with the planning said the first phase of the project was easily achievable and could be enough to Mr. PERSON to declare a political victory.

The report lists several potential obstacles to construction of walls and fencing along the full border, including the need to acquire privately held land and requirements of ORG, a NORP agency that must approve changes that could impact ORG. In GPE, the river is the border between the two countries.

The ORG report says that in 2008, it had projected it would cost $11 million per mile for fencing in GPE, GPE, but that adaptations needs to deal with a flood plain and to meet the commission’s requirements drove the price to $15 million per mile.

On Wednesday, Mr. PERSON projected confidence about the project as he told a law-enforcement conference he would help ORG Secretary PERSON stop drugs from coming into the GPE

“We will give him a wall, and it will be a real wall,” Mr. PERSON said. He said the wall is ”being designed right now” and dismissed speculation was joking about building it.

“I don’t kid,” Mr. PERSON said.""",0
806,"Immigration hawks think that NORP might support lowering legal immigration in return for a permanent amnesty for illegal aliens who arrived in the GPE as minors, ORG has learned.
The PERSON administration has put its full force behind LAW, with both President PERSON and his cabinet secretaries praising the legislation. The bill, which is sponsored by NORP senators PERSON and PERSON, aims to decrease legal immigration from around 1 million annually to roughly 500,000 a year.
PERSON, executive director of ORG, wrote in ORG that a way for LAW to get 60 votes in the ORG would be for it to include amnesty for the 800,000 or so beneficiaries of ORG (DACA).
ORG is the program started by President PERSON in 2012 that protects illegal immigrants who arrived as minors from deportation and gives them work permits.
Ten NORP state attorneys general have threatened to sue the federal government if the program isGPE ended by September, and the ORG administration could refuse to defend the program much like the PERSON administration did with ORG.
GPE went on GPE Thursday morning and told ORG PERSON, “Now there is a real possibility the plug will be pulled on that program [DACA] and so the NORP are willing to trade a stable lawful amnesty to replace PERSON’s illegal measure in exchange for the bill which was introduce yesterday.”
ORG was also told by a source in a think tank that supports reducing immigration that he suspects that a form of legislative amnesty will be passed in return for passage of LAW.
President PERSON promised to immediately terminate DACA while on the campaign trail, but has yet to do so. Roughly 100,000 illegal immigrants have benefited from the program in his first few months in office.
ORG has continued to say that the program’s future is under review.",1
2563,"President PERSON and senior NORP failed to strike a deal in talks on Friday to end a partial shutdown of the GPE government as they again fought over ORG’s request for $5 billion to fund his signature wall on the NORP border.
After NORP congressional leaders turned ORG down at a meeting in ORG Situation Room, the NORP president threatened to take the controversial step of using emergency powers to build the wall without approval from ORG.
ORG is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall and as a result about 800,000 federal workers have been unpaid due to the closure of about a quarter of the federal government.
Administration officials, led by Vice President PERSON, and congressional staffers are to meet during the weekend to try to end the impasse over the 2-week-old shutdown.
ORG NORP Leader PERSON said NORP had told ORG during the meeting to end the shutdown. “He resisted,” PERSON said. “In fact, he said he’d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.”
ORG confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when NORP took control of ORG on Thursday.
“We had a very, very productive meeting, and we’ve come a long way,” ORG said.
But raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened NORP, ORG threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into GPE.
Asked by a reporter whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, ORG said: “Yes, I have ... I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.”
He said he could declare a national emergency “because of the security of our country, absolutely.”
LAW ORG the power over funding the federal government so ORG likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass ORG on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having GPE pay for it - was one of ORG’s main promises when he ran for president in 2016.
ORG’s wall project is estimated to cost about $23 billion.
NORP have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval.
PERSON, the newly elected NORP speaker of the ORG, said Friday’s meeting with ORG was “sometimes contentious” but that they agreed to continue talking.
“But we recognize on the NORP side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,” she said.
Credit rating agency ORG says the shutdown will cause minimal GPE economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.
A ORG/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blame ORG for the shutdown and 7 percent blame NORP lawmakers, against 32 percent who blame NORP.
In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and PERSON, ORG said he would be “proud” to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame NORP. He has since said they are responsible.The partial shutdown is straining the country’s immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

My backyard is on the border. To me, “build that wall” is not a slogan. To me, the fight over a border wall is not an abstract argument about politics. To me — and to my family and neighbors — construction of a border wall is personal.
My family has lived on land along ORG in GPE, GPE, for at least five generations. I have lived on this land for more than 40 years; my father lives next to me, alongside the land where my grandfather lived. We still use a wooden corral built by my great-grandfather for keeping farm animals. My grandchild and nieces and nephews play in the same places where their parents and grandparents played.
In all my time here, I have never seen an “invasion” of criminals or drug traffickers or gang members rushing across the border, as the president described in a press conference. In fact, I can’t remember ever seeing a migrant cross the river from GPE and come across my family’s property. To do so, someone would have to climb up the soft bluff that runs alongside the river at the end of my property. The natural barrier of the river and the bluff makes my family’s property unattractive as a crossing place.

ORG's unfair, unlawful emergency declaration
Because ORG would not appropriate the amount of funds the president wants to build a border wall, he declared a national emergency on our southern border to try to free up billions of dollars to build a wall.
The president circumventing ORG is unlawful, as my lawyers at Public Citizen have explained in a legal challenge filed against the president on the same day he issued his emergency declaration. While my lawyers will argue the legalities of the president’s action, the bottom line for me is that the federal government is threatening to take my land to fulfill a campaign promise but without any need.

I have received letters from the GPE government stating that the government is going to take me to court to gain access to my property and build a border wall across my land. The maps they sent me show a wall and a maintenance road to be constructed just a few feet from the back of my house. They describe a 150-foot wide enforcement zone and a 25-foot wide road between my house and the river — but the river is only 200 feet from my house, and the land closest to the river is unstable and subject to erosion.
In January, I called a ORG realty specialist to ask how they could possibly fit the border wall and enforcement zone between my house and the river. They told me that they were going to build the wall even if they had to squeeze it in.
Even if my house itself is spared, it will never be the same. I will lose my entire backyard, and I will be staring at a wall right outside my back door and windows. My family’s property next door, where we enjoy family gatherings and the ranching lifestyle, will be divided by the wall, with about two-thirds of the land on the south side of the wall.
I live on a peaceful stretch of property along the river in LOC, in GPE. To me, “build that wall” is not simply a slogan; instead, it is a threat to my way of life, my liberty, and my property.

453,"PERSON agents stopped two previously deported sex offenders from successfully making their way back into the GPE — one a child molester, the second, a rapist.
In separate incidents, PERSON agents apprehended two previously deported criminal aliens as they attempted to make their way back into the GPE interior. Officials reported that agents assigned to ORG arrested a 53-year-old NORP national on January 24 for illegally crossing the border. Agents transported the migrant to the station for processing where they discovered his criminal and immigration history, according to information obtained from ORG officials.
All migrants arrested by ORG agents undergo a biometric background check to search for prior criminal history, gang affiliation, or immigration violations. In this case, records revealed that a court in GPE, GPE, convicted the NORP national in 2012 for child molestation. The court sentenced the migrant to 10 years in state prison. Immigration officers deported the man in April 2017 after he served five years of the sentence.
Three days later, ORG agents arrested a 48-year-old NORP national for illegal entry into the GPE, officials stated. During a background investigation, the agents learned that a court in GPE, GPE, convicted the man in 1996 for rape. Immigration officers deported the criminal alien after he served two years of a five-year prison sentence, officials reported.
“Apprehensions like these highlight our commitment to the safety and security of our communities,” PERSON Chief Patrol Agent PERSON said in a written statement. “Our agents work diligently every day to prevent dangerous individuals, like these two sex offenders, from entering our the county.”

2410,"Attorneys for a NORP immigrant in GPE, who has permission to work in GPE, are hoping to convince a federal judge to hear a challenge to his immigration arrest and bypass GPE immigration courts.

If they are successful on Wednesday, the case of PERSON, a so-called dreamer afforded some protection from deportation under an GPE-era program, could point a new way forward for thousands of people across the country threatened by stepped-up immigration enforcement under President PERSON.

Under GPE law, deportation cases must be heard by immigration courts but PERSON hopes to establish an alternate legal challenge over his arrest. Immigration courts, which operate separately from the broader federal judiciary, have a huge backlog and immigration lawyers say it is difficult to win deportation challenges in them.

By contesting what they say was PERSON’s unconstitutional arrest rather than his deportation action, his lawyers hope to have the case heard in the federal court system rather than in immigration court.

However, questions from the GPE federal judge ahead of the hearing suggest PERSON’s lawyers could face an uphill battle.

The case could be the first under the ORG administration in which a person granted a work permit under LAW (DACA) has been taken into immigration custody, PERSON’s lawyers say. The Obama-era program offers protection from deportation for some 750,000 immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. These people are sometimes called “dreamers,” in reference to ORG (DREAM) legislation that failed to pass ORG.

PERSON was arrested in February by ORG) officers who went to his house to arrest his father.

ICE alleged PERSON had gang ties and should be deported.

PERSON’s lawyers have denied their client has any gang involvement or criminal record.

ORG lawyers said in their filings that immigration court is the only appropriate venue for challenging deportation-related issues. They pointed to a ruling last year from ORG, which said federal courts did not have jurisdiction to hear a class action brought by children claiming the right to legal representation in immigration court.

Because the case involved deportations, ORG said it must be litigated in immigration court.

Last week, GPE Magistrate Judge PERSON in GPE signaled that he was taking ORG argument seriously. Donohue posed several written questions to PERSON’s lawyers about their legal arguments, and asked for a “more thorough discussion” of the ORG case.

Lawyers for arrested individuals have long sought ways to avoid immigration court, but it is difficult, said Ira Kurzban, a GPE lawyer who has written books on immigration law.

If PERSON wins a clear ruling that ORG unconstitutionally arrested him, PERSON said, it could open a path for other immigrants to try the same tactic.

PERSON’s lawyers said the ORG case does not involve arrests, so it should not weigh against their argument. They cited ORG rulings that even prisoners at LOC have the right to challenge their detention in federal court.

ORG will hear arguments from both sides on Wednesday, and could rule from the bench on whether he has the power to hear PERSON’s case.",0
1249,"Two private prison companies are facing legal pressure over work programs at detention centers that pay migrants $1 a day to perform tasks such as cleaning or working in the centers’ kitchens.

Recent lawsuits have accused ORG and ORG of violating federal laws prohibiting forced labor, state minimum-wage laws or unjust-enrichment laws. The companies run detention centers for migrants caught crossing the southern border, detained asking for asylum at an official entry place or accused of living in the GPE illegally.

PERSON, who represents several plaintiffs, said that while prisons can force people convicted of crimes to work, they can’t do the same to people who haven’t been. “The key distinction is because immigration detention is civil in nature,” said Mr. PERSON. “The people in these places cannot be made to work against their will.”

The companies—the nation’s two largest private prison operators—say the longstanding work programs for migrants are voluntary and are sanctioned by ORG and Customs Enforcement.

The $1-a-day rate for immigrant detainees was established by ORG decades ago. ORG’s detention standards say detainees may volunteer for such work to “earn money while confined” and that the resulting “decreased idleness” could ease the “negative impact of confinement.”

ORG spokesman PERSON said the company’s voluntary work programs “are consistent with similar programs at other ICE facilities—operated by both public and private entities—and that meet our contractual obligations.”

PRODUCT spokesman ORG pointed out that the voluntary work program and wage rates were set by the government. “As a service provider to the federal government, PERSON is required to abide by these federally mandated standards and congressionally established guidelines,” he said.

The legal challenges gained traction earlier this year when ORG for the 10th Circuit agreed with a lower-court ruling to allow nine immigrant detainees held at ORG 1,500-bed detention center in GPE, GPE, to represent a class of about 60,000 others who have been held there in recent years.

ORG is appealing the ORG decision to ORG. PERSON’s attorneys have argued that the company is simply following ORG’s own policies on voluntary work.

The ORG administration wants to detain more migrants who have crossed the southern border as it tries to crack down on immigration. The number of migrants in detention while awaiting immigration hearings or deportation has risen to a daily average of 40,000 this year from 34,000 two years ago.

A group of 18 NORP congressman including GPE’s Rep. PERSON sent a letter to ICE earlier this year recommending that the agency step in to defend the private prison companies and offer new guidance on the work program to prevent such lawsuits.

“The very goal of the advocates who file these lawsuits is to raise the overall costs of immigration detention in order to discourage its use and diminish the overall level of immigration enforcement in GPE,” the letter said.

Meanwhile, GPE state Attorney General PERSON, a NORP, filed a lawsuit last fall against ORG over the $1-a-day work program at a detention center in GPE, alleging the company is violating the state’s minimum wage laws.

PERSON, an ORG spokeswoman, said the agency had responded to the letter from the congressmen, but declined to provide the response. Under its detention standards, detainees may volunteer for work assignments but otherwise shouldn’t be required to work except for personal housekeeping, she said.

She declined to comment on the litigation because ORG isn’t a party.

PERSON, former director of ORG at ICE under the GPE administration, said private prison companies may pay more than a $1 a day under ORG’s detention standards. He said the low-wage labor keeps the contractors’ operating costs low.

“They are profiting off of it,” said Mr. PERSON. “To some extent detention facilities use detainee labor in place of paid employees doing their work.”

According to court filings, PERSON said that if it had to pay the detainees minimum wage, it would affect how much it would charge the government.

In a suit filed in April, attorneys allege that PERSON, a ORG man seeking asylum, was threatened with sanctions if he stopped working for $1 to $4 a day as a kitchen laborer at ORG’s 2,000-bed detention center in GPE, GPE

Mr. PERSON, the ORG spokesman, declined to comment on the case, but said that all work programs are voluntary and in compliance with rules for detainee labor.

“We set and deliver the same high standard of care—including three daily meals, access to health care and other everyday living needs—regardless of whether a detainee participates in a voluntary work program,” Mr. PERSON said.

In the PRODUCT case, one detainee, PERSON, said in court filings that he was forced to clean for no pay while he was held there in 2014 and 2015. Those who refused to work were threatened with solitary confinement, the suit alleges. The suit also attacks the $1-a-day voluntary work program at ORG for allegedly violating a GPE law prohibiting unjust enrichment.

At an annual shareholders meeting in April, Geo Chief Executive PERSON said the lawsuits wouldn’t change the company’s procedures.

“The $1-per-day payment for immigration detention detainees was established by ORG and is stipulated in our contracts,” said Mr. PERSON. Unless a change is made, “we will continue to pay the stipulated amount of $1 per day.”",0
625,"Some federal judges handling immigration-related cases are balking at delaying court proceedings during the government shutdown. Such judges are acting differently than courts did during 2013’s shutdown under President PERSON.
In 2013, federal courts postponed cases involving ORG (DOJ) attorneys. During this shutdown, most federal courts are apparently doing likewise. Other judges with immigration-related or ORG-centered cases, however, are requiring DOJ attorneys to work pending litigation.
Such judges ignore the LAW’s limits on their authority. Federal courts, as classically explained in GPE #78, “have neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment.”
As devotees of the progressive movement, however, many judges reject the LAW’s structure of separation of powers. Some really believe federal courts should be the most powerful branch of government. They are rightly called “judicial supremacists.”
NORP judges have been over-reaching their authority with impunity for many years. They push the limits like speculators who believe stock or real-estate markets will never crash. As Federalist #78 cautions, federal courts must “ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.”
NORP’ respect for courts and the rule of law results in court judgments being routinely implemented. But when a party refuses to comply with a judgment, who enforces it? Judges are powerless on their own. They must rely on ORG.
Some federal judges consider ORG to be court employees, but they’re not. Marshals are DOJ employees, with some assigned to federal courts. Thus, ORG ultimately work for the president.
LAW (ORG), triggered in government shutdowns, illustrates separation-of-powers interplay among the branches. The ORG, ORG’s attempt to restrain executive spending, also applies to the courts. It bars officers and employees from obligating funds ORG has not appropriated. Thus, shutdowns force furloughing of non-essential employees.
In this shutdown, some judges are presuming to have power over executive branch decisions about who is and is not essential. Like the executive, courts decide who of their own employees are essential. Interfering in DOJ’s decisions about essential employees is political, not judicial, action.
To comply with these illegitimate orders, DOJ must either change or ignore its own shutdown plan. If DOJ’s “non-essential” lawyers appear in court, they would be acting as “volunteers.”
The ORG bars volunteering “except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.” The ORG provides that “the term ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property’ does not include ongoing, regular functions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property.”
“Knowing and willful” ORG violations constitute crimes.
Nevertheless, a judge hearing challenges to restrictions on asylum-seekers is insisting DOJ lawyers continue working. He claims his case involves” the safety of human life or the protection of property.” But his case doesn’t necessarily meet the ORG’s definition of “emergency.” The judge’s comments reflect his annoyance that 91 percent of ORG workers continue working.
This judge doesn’t disguise disagreement with President PERSON’s judgments about safety. He sees asylum seekers; ORG sees invading aliens. The judge likely believes himself duty-bound to block ORG’s border policies. The LAW, however, makes presidents primarily responsible for defending the country’s safety. Unlike initiating war, which requires a declaration by ORG, the president is obligated to defend the country against attacks and invasions — including by organized caravans.
ORG should reread PERSON v. PERSON. Like PERSON, GPE couples the independence of the federal judiciary with the separation-of-powers limits to its authority.
In GPE, Chief Justice PERSON ruled the ORG lacked jurisdiction to order a particular action against ORG’s Secretary of ORG. PERSON also realized that President PERSON would never enforce any such order. Both sides understood that federal courts lack power and depend ultimately on the president enforcing court orders.
Like PERSON, GPE, and PERSON, President PERSON does not hesitate to criticize federal judges. Consider what President PERSON could — but hopefully will not — do. ORG are classified as essential. Some marshals have already been dispatched to the border. What would happen if the president directed more marshals to the border, including those assigned to federal courts? Unavoidably, without marshals for safety protection, courts would close. And federal judges could do nothing but complain.
LAW ensures each branch has the ability to defend itself against the other two, ideally producing a peaceful equilibrium. Judicial supremacists distort that structure to favor the judiciary.
Every judge addicted to power should consider the hypothetical of an unpredictable president doing the unthinkable. Re-deploying court-assigned marshals during a shutdown would reveal the powerlessness of judges. It would also provide political leverage, otherwise lacking, against congressional NORP. Such a hypothetical should remind everyone that the federal judiciary remains “the weakest branch.”",1
405,"Deportation of illegal immigrants hit a 10-year low during President PERSON’s last full fiscal year in office. ORG also appeared to be cutting back on information provided about all three of its law enforcement agencies.
The administration waited until the last Friday of the year to release its final FY 2016 report on ORG removal operations.
“It’s no wonder that they waited for a day when hardly a soul was paying attention; the numbers for ICE are abysmal, even worse than 2015,” ORG Director of Policy Studies PERSON reported this week. If there were an award for government reports that aim to obfuscate and spin, I would nominate this one.”
ORG wrote that the annual reports have historically provided basic statistics from all three of the department’s law enforcement agencies. This year, the report sneaked out by ORG officials on the last working day of the month normally, in two versions, was scaled back to provide only a fraction of the information normally disclosed. The reported is compiled by ORG (ORG) which has a new director, PERSON.
ORG listed the following as key findings from the annual report:
PERSON credited to ORG in 2016 increased by 2 percent. All of the increase came from cases of aliens arrested by ORG, not interior enforcement.
ORG deportations fell from 69,478 in 2015 to 65,322 in 2016, out of a population of illegal aliens now estimated at 12 million.
PERSON of criminal aliens fell from 63,127 in 2015 to 60,318 in 2016, out of an estimated population of two million.
The total number of deportations under the GPE administration is not easily comparable to prior administrations because of the number of border cases included, but it certainly is not record-breaking, as GPE has claimed.
ORG maintains that ORG arrests have always been a large share of ICE deportations, but in fact this is a new development under ORG. In prior administrations, only a third of deportations credited to ORG were border cases; now about two-thirds are.
One of the priorities of ORG was supposed to be deporting criminal aliens and others designated under ORG introduced in November 2014. PERSON GPE Managing Director PERSON dubbed the program “WORK_OF_ART” in an article published in January 2015.
“Before these changes,” a federal agent with ORG told PERSON at the time, “all illegal aliens arrested by ORG were required to enter the deportation system where they would be scheduled for a deportation hearing at a future date. Under this new system, the illegal aliens are not even required to show up for a hearing ever.”
“Not only are we releasing these people with no hearings scheduled, no notice to appear, but the DHS [ORG] is forcing ORG to prepare the initial paperwork for the illegal aliens’ work permits.” The source added, “NORP really need to think about the terrorism-related implications of this. Illegal aliens who are suspected of having terrorism ties, but not convicted, could be permitted to stay in the country.”
The impact of the new program has been dramatic in a negative way. The charts below show the dramatic decline of interior deportations (called removals by the ORG) and the removal of criminal aliens from the GPE:
ORG reported that 98 percent of all interior deportations were convicted criminals. This means that other migrants who have been crossing the border in massive numbers for the past several years are simply allowed to stay.
Even though the removal of criminal aliens made up nearly all of the interior deportations, the numbers of criminals being deported also continued to fall from previous years. This is not because the country is running out of criminal aliens to deport.
“The main reason for the decline is the GPE administration’s prioritization scheme that has steadily narrowed the types of cases that ICE officers are permitted to pursue.
The total number of removals (deportations and voluntary returns) increased by less than 5,000 in FY 2016 compared to FY 2015. However, the total deportation number of 240,000 aliens is 41 percent lower than the peak FY 2012 numbers.
“GPE has the lowest rate of deportations since ORG,” Vaughn stated. “The administration and its allies frequently point out that more than two million removals have occurred since 2009, an accomplishment that they characterize as record-breaking.”
ORG explains why this is not true:
But counting only removals as deportations presents a misleading picture of the level of enforcement. Removals are just one form of the deportation process that can be executed by any of the three ORG enforcement agencies (ICE, Border Patrol, and ORG officers at the port of entry). All three enforcement agencies also can process deportable aliens as a return (sometimes known as voluntary return), which is a lesser consequence. In general most border deportations are processed as returns and most interior deportations are processed as removals, but in recent years many more aliens apprehended at the border have been turned over to ICE for a brief period of detention and then removed in recent years, in a departure from the traditional “you catch ’em, you clean ’em” policies, where the arresting agency typically handles the deportation process. In addition, illegal border-crossers who have been removed previously, or who are prosecuted for smuggling or other crimes are turned over to ICE for processing. Under these scenarios, ORG will count the case as an apprehension, which is their marquee enforcement metric, and ORG will count the case as a deportation. Under ORG, a much larger number of ORG cases were transferred to ICE for processing than had been the case under prior administrations. In 2008, the last year of GPE administration, just over a third of deportations credited to ORG were border cases, and two-thirds were interior cases. In 2016, more than two-thirds of the deportation cases credited to ICE were border cases, and less than a third were interior cases.
Rather than using removals as the measurement, ORG suggests that a more “apples-to-apples” comparison can be made by examining interior deportations and border removals separately. “Neither the Border Patrol nor ORG publishes the total number of deportations executed, and many of the cases are transferred to ORG, so year-by-year comparisons of border deportations alone are impossible using open source statistics,” she stated.
Using these methods, ORG concluded that ORG has completed a total of 5.3 million deportations (both interior and border removals. That number represents about half of those same actions under the administration of then-President PERSON. It is not ORG that holds the record for deportations. Rather, it is ORG record with 12.3 million deportations reported.
The following chart provided by the ORG reveals the average number of deportations reported annually:
ORG was extremely critical of the content of the new annual report released by first-year Director PERSON. ”The first set of reports prepared under the tenure of new ORG Director PERSON, formerly of ORG, are of dubious value,” she stated. She explained that the previous year’s reported provided numerous data tables and explanatory materials providing a more neutral view of actions taken by the department. Typically, those reports would provide data covering multiple years for comparison.
“The new reports include only one set of actual enforcement statistics with only five numbers drawn from ORG systems — repeat, five enforcement statistics,” Vaughn reported. “Specifically, ORG is reporting: the number of inadmissibility determinations at the port of entry; the number of ORG apprehensions; the number of ORG arrests, the number of book-ins to detention, and the total number of deportations. No numbers are provided for prior years, but percentage changes from 2015 are reported.”
ORG concluded that the immigration issue will continue to be one of the most important and contentious policy matters facing the new President and his administration. “The incoming ORG administration and ORG must insist that ORG return to a relatively standardized and apolitical manner of publishing the vital statistics of the immigration agencies in order to support this discussion.”

509,"ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-KY) said Thursday that President PERSON will sign legislation to prevent a second partial government shutdown and declare a national emergency to build a wall along the ORG border.
“He’s prepared to sign the bill, he will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time,” PERSON said ahead of a ORG vote on a measure to keep the government running past the February 15 deadline.
The comprise measure keeps departments running through the fiscal year but without the $5.7 billion the president wanted for the border wall with GPE.
Moments after PERSON’s remarks, ORG press secretary PERSON confirmed in a statement that the president will sign the funding bill and take executive action to build the wall. “President PERSON will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action – including a national emergency – to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border. The President is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country,” ORG said.
ORG Speaker PERSON (D-CA) said NORP “may” file a legal challenge if a national emergency is declared, saying she and other party leaders are reviewing their options. “I may, that’s an option. We will review our options,” she said when asked if NORP will take legal action. “But it’s important to note that when the president declares this emergency, first of all, it’s not an emergency. What’s happening at the border is a humanitarian challenge to us. The president is trying to sell a bill of goods.”
Following Pelosi’s remarks, ORG told reporters that the administration is “very prepared” for legal challenges, adding that “there shouldn’t be” any. “The president’s doing his job. ORG should do theirs,” she said.
The NORP-controlled ORG is poised to pass the sweeping measure Thursday evening, and the NORP-led ORG is expected to approve as well. Bargainers formally completed the accord moments before midnight Wednesday night.
The product of nearly three weeks of talks, the agreement provides almost $1.4 billion for new barriers along the boundary. That’s less than the $1.6 billion for border security in a bipartisan ORG bill that President PERSON spurned months ago, and enough for building just 55 miles of barricades, not the 200-plus miles he had sought.
Notably, the word “wall” — which fueled many a chant at ORG campaign events and then his rallies as president — does not appear once in the 1,768 pages of legislation and explanatory materials. “Barriers” and “fencing” are the nouns of choice.
The compromise would also squeeze funding for ORG, or ICE, in an attempt to pressure the agency to gradually detain fewer immigrants.
Speaking to reporters on ORG, ORG chair Rep. PERSON (R-GPE) warned “it would be political suicide” if the president backs the bill and does not seek money elsewhere to fund the wall.

1226,"For the last two seasons, ORG has depended on legal migrant workers to harvest potatoes, onions and watermelons growing in its fields on the outskirts of GPE.

Now the farm is bearing different fruit: a first-of-its-kind federal lawsuit that federal officials and immigration activists say exemplifies the pitfalls of the nation’s agricultural visa program—as ORG proposes changes to it.

This year ORG took the farm to court, saying its owner, PERSON, underpaid some of its 69 workers by not offering a set, hourly wage and housed them in an “encampment” consisting of yellow school buses and semitrailers that “violated numerous safety, sanitation and fire code regulations.”

PERSON, the regional solicitor in charge of the case for ORG, called the living situations a “horror show” that could have led to many worker deaths.

The case is the first time the department won a preliminary injunction against a farm using the temporary farmworker visa, known as the ORG A federal judge barred the business from housing the workers in the encampment, forcing it to house them in an apartment complex and an extended-stay motel for the rest of the season.

Mr. PERSON declined to comment. His attorney said he is cooperating with federal officials.

The case comes as demand for foreign farmworkers soars, and as ORG is expected to introduce a measure later this year that could make changes to guest worker programs. ORG has certified 160,084 workers through the program so far this year, a 20% increase from the year-earlier period.

President PERSON has discussed a revamped guest worker program with NORP President PERSON. GPE received 92% of the H2A visas issued last year, according to data from ORG. Separately, the ORG administration is backing a proposal to cut the number of green cards annually by half.

GPE Rep. PERSON, chairman of ORG and a member of ORG, last month said it was “well past the time to replace the outdated and onerous H2A program” and activists said they expect him to introduce a bill aimed at the program later this year.

PERSON, vice president and general counsel for ORG, which represents local and regional farmers in GPE, GPE and GPE, said there has “historically been good oversight and enforcement in the H2A program, and this case demonstrates that those enforcement mechanisms are working. ... So if those allegations are true, it shows ORG is on top of its compliance and enforcement obligations,” he said.

Critics say the H2A program has been rife with abuse because of poor living conditions and wages for workers. ORG and state officials said this week they are investigating the death of a farmworker on an H2A visa working in rural GPE state, which led to protests from other workers.

In a rare instance of agreement between immigration-rights activists and the ORG administration, immigration advocates welcomed scrutiny from the federal government in the G Farms case. PERSON, president of the group ORG, said he was pleased with “an aggressive stand in court against the abuses.”

But he said he fears that efforts to revamp the program—either through Mr. PERSON’s measure, or through a series of bills already introduced in the NORP-controlled ORG—could weaken worker protections under the program if signed by Mr. PERSON.

Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue recently hired a former ORG lobbyist that critics on both the left and the right expect will lead the push for an H2A expansion.

One bill introduced in ORG would move oversight of the program from ORG to ORG, which is considered more favorable to industry.

Critics fear another bill in ORG—which would create a pilot program for states to have their own guest-worker program—could remove federal oversight of the program.

Another bill proposed by Rep. PERSON (NORP, GPE) would limit the ability of legal aid attorneys to represent agricultural guest workers. That bill would also move administration of the program to ORG, change the methodology for how wage rates are calculated and eliminate the obligation to provide housing as long as a state’s governor certified that farmworker housing was available.

“Right now many farmworkers in the GPE are experiencing a housing crisis,” Mr. PERSON said. “Many farmworkers are already living in very crowded shelters, sometimes it is a house, sometimes it is a trailer, sometimes they are just living in cars.”

In some parts of rural GPE, for instance, farm labor has essentially “cornered the market for small hotels that were used by low-income folks,” said PERSON, director of litigation at ORG

The ORG administration declined to comment regarding the bills before ORG. Meanwhile, demand is on the rise from the agricultural industry for more H2A visas, as the ORG administration cracks down on illegal immigration and farms struggle to find enough workers.

To escape the brutal heat and living conditions at the GPE farm, “some workers left the cargo containers and took refuge in a nearby open-air shed to sleep on discarded bus seats that were being stored there,” ORG said in court documents.

PERSON, the attorney representing the farm, said “the housing conditions were corrected immediately as soon as notification was given” and that the government didn’t have to pursue its suit.

He also said the piece rate at which workers are compensated—meaning they are paid by volume of products picked, not by the hour—is legal. But he added that many workers were paid less than what would be equivalent to the legally required $10.95 an hour during their first weeks of work because they were adjusting to the pace of labor.

“In our view, the lawsuit that got filed almost immediately didn’t need to be filed,” he said. “Our client had already fixed all the deficiencies.”

ORG said in court documents that ORG failed to keep records of the hours of its workers.

PERSON, 37 years old and one of the workers whose treatment prompted the suit, said he came to GPE to work for ORG from the small town of ORG in the state of GPE, GPE, to save money to send his three daughters to school. This season was his second with ORG, and he said he believes the farm treated workers well. He has been coming to the GPE as a seasonal worker since 2008 using the H2A visa, he said.

After ORG intervention, he was paid $10.95 an hour and worked eight hours a day on the farm. At night, he slept in the motel.

Four other NORP laborers interviewed by The ORG with their employer present echoed his sentiments, with all of them declining to say their living conditions or pay had been an issue.

“We were living good, we weren’t lacking in anything,“ Mr. PERSON said. ”We had everything we needed.”

Ms. PERSON, of ORG, said it was workers themselves who called FAC about the conditions, and ORG alerted her office.

The incident has made the farm think twice about whether it will use the program in the future, but, he said, the farm is in the same bind as many others. There simply isn’t enough accessible labor.

“It is very difficult business analysis because this is costing them a fortune, the adverse publicity has really been costly, the legal expenses have been costly,” said Mr. PERSON, the farm’s lawyer. “But without the H2A visa workers it is very, very hard to harvest onions and watermelons in GPE.”",0
2496,"The PERSON administration is shifting $271 million earmarked for disaster aid and cyber security to pay for immigration-related facilities, ORG and a leading congressional NORP said on Tuesday.

The money, which was also set aside for ORG, will be used to pay for detention facilities and courts for migrants arriving at the ORG border. DHS officials say they have been overwhelmed by a surge of asylum-seeking migrants fleeing violence and poverty in LOC.

The ORG administration is seeking to circumvent ORG to move money originally designated for other programs. This will allow the administration to continue to house immigrants arriving at the border, part of President PERSON’s promise not to allow them to await hearings outside of custody.

The administration plans to take $115 million from ORG disaster-relief fund just as hurricane season is heating up in LOC, according to a letter from GPE Representative PERSON, who chairs the congressional panel that oversees ORG (DHS) spending.

Money will be taken for planned upgrades to ORG and new equipment for ORG, the letter said.

ORG said ORG did not provide enough money for ORG (ICE) to detain single adults as they wait for their cases to be heard by an immigration judge.

ORG appropriated $2.8 billion to pay for 52,000 beds this year, but ORG is currently detaining more than 55,000 immigrants, a record high, according to agency statistics.

ORG said ORG was exceeding its authority to move money around to respond to emergencies.

“Once again, ORG has ignored the negotiated agreement with ORG by vastly exceeding the amount appropriated for immigration enforcement and removal operations,” she said in a statement.

ORG Speaker PERSON, a NORP, urged the ORG administration to reconsider the shift in funds.

“Stealing from appropriated funds is always unacceptable, but to pick the pockets of disaster relief funding in order to fund an appalling, inhumane family incarceration plan is staggering - and to do so on the eve of hurricane season is stunningly reckless,” Pelosi said in a statement.

ORG spokeswoman PERSON said the funding reduction will not impact readiness efforts or other functions for which the money was earmarked.

ORG has made cracking down on legal and illegal immigration a hallmark of his presidency after campaigning in 2016 on a promise, so far unfulfilled, that GPE would pay for a border wall to keep migrants from entering GPE.

A record-setting 42,000 families were apprehended along the GPE southern border in July, more than twice as many as in May.

Last week, ORG unveiled a new rule that would allow officials to detain migrant families indefinitely - abolishing a previous 20-day limit - while judges consider whether to grant them asylum in GPE.",0
633,"The exodus of NORP to neighboring countries could soon eclipse the number of refugees flowing from GPE at the height of the country’s civil war.
More than three million NORP have fled the country and now live in countries like GPE or even the GPE, according to a review of figures provided by ORG and ORG. More than 330,000 NORP have declared asylum in countries throughout the LOC.
GPE has absorbed the largest amount of migrants, with 1,200,000 NORP currently living there. 
For comparison, ORG figures put the total number of NORP asylum seekers during the 2015 refugee crisis in LOC at over 450,000. By December 2017, one million NORP applied for asylum throughout the continent.
ORG, roughly five million NORP are displaced outside of their home country. Nearly three million NORP currently reside in GPE.
At the beginning of January 2018, there was a 20,500 percent increase in asylum seeking applications from NORP compared to one year prior. ORG says that from 2012 to November 2018, asylum applications from NORP increased 74,191 percent.
FAC, a news organizations dedicated to covering GPE’s economic collapse, says the “general profile” of a NORP migrant is most likely a 31-year-old single male with some level of education.
Neighboring NORP countries have struggled processing the surge of migrants looking for work and protection. GPE saw as many as 4,200 NORP arriving in the country a day in August 2018.",1
2311,"The PERSON administration on Monday told the federal judge who blocked a temporary travel ban on citizens from seven majority-NORP countries that it was keeping its legal options open pending further word from a federal appeals court.
In a response to Judge PERSON that was due Monday afternoon, ORG said scheduled proceedings in his GPE state court should be delayed until the full ORG for ORG decides whether to rehear the government's case.
""At this time, defendants believe the appropriate course is to postpone any further proceedings in the district court,"" acting Assistant Attorney General PERSON wrote.
But the states of GPE and GPE urged ORG to skip further procedural steps and begin hearing their case against the travel ban on the merits. ""Given the gravity of the states’ constitutional allegations, defendants’ stated national security concerns, and the public interests at stake, the states respectfully submit that discovery should proceed without delay,"" lawyers for the two states said.
With two strikes against the ban already this month — first from ORG, then from a three-judge panel of ORG — the full appeals court is weighing whether to hear ORG's plea to restart the travel ban while the legal challenge continues. Both the government and the states must provide their input by Thursday.
It is unlikely the full appeals court will vote to rehear the case, since the large majority of its judges were named by NORP presidents, but at that point objecting judges would be able to voice dissents. The rulings against the ban came from two judges nominated by NORP and two by NORP.
If the appeals court decides against a rehearing, the government could appeal to ORG, continue the case before the three-judge panel, return to ORG's district court in GPE, or rewrite the executive order in an effort to make it easier to uphold in court. At this point, all those options remain on the table.
ORG's ban, announced Jan. 27, temporarily barred citizens of GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days, and NORP citizens indefinitely. It led to chaos at GPE and international airports as tens of thousands of visa holders were blocked from entering the country or detained after arriving in the GPE
A barrage of protests and lawsuits followed, leading to federal court rulings against the ban in GPE, GPE and elsewhere. One judge in GPE later ruled in ORG's favor, but since then judges from GPE, GPE, to GPE have said it may violate the constitutional rights of visa holders, green card holders and others, and that it lacks sufficient national security justification.
The PERSON administration contends that the president has authority under the LAW and congressional statute to control immigration for national security purposes. They point to a 1952 law that allows a president to bar entry to immigrants or classes of immigrants if the president deems them to be ""detrimental to the interests of GPE.""
The appeals court panel said that although the president should get ""considerable deference"" in the areas of immigration and national security, ""it is beyond question that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action.",0

87,"As the ORG administration regroups from multiple political and legal setbacks in its efforts to curb illegal immigration, the message south of the border could not be more clear, with families and unaccompanied minors flooding into GPE, GPE and GPE.

An alarming new report from ORG shows the number of families crossing into the GPE illegally surged last month. The agency said illegal immigrants have been taking advantage of a legal loophole that requires “family units” to be released once they are caught.

New figures showed a 10 percent increase in August of unaccompanied minors, a 38 percent increase among families entering illegally or asking for asylum. Overall, people arrested or stopped at the border totaled nearly 47,000 in August, up 17 percent from July and up 52 percent from August 2017.

Why are illegal immigrants opting out of welfare programs?Video
""These numbers are a result of our failure do what is necessary to control the border,"" said PERSON, executive director of the right-leaning ORG.

The administration tried separating parents and children to deter immigrants from making the dangerous trek through GPE, however a political outcry forced it to reverse the policy. It also tried holding in families in detention until their court date, but the courts rejected the policy. As a result, ORG sources say, immigrants see an opportunity to exploit gridlock in GPE and get in while the administration tries to figure out its next step.

""My question is how many illegal immigrants have to be let go into the GPE for there to be a political demand that something be done about it,"" said PERSON, who favors stricter border enforcement.

The numbers say something entirely different to PERSON, executive director of ORG.

""The situation in LOC is so bad, parents are deciding that the risk of losing their child to the GPE government is better than the risk of losing their child to violence,"" said PERSON. ""This leaves lawmakers two choices. They can continue a failed strategy of trying to enforce our way out of a problem... Or, they can develop bipartisan solutions that address root causes in LOC and ensure migrants fleeing violence and persecution can seek protection and a fair hearing in the GPE”

In the last nine months, 98.6 percent of families who entered the GPE illegally or without papers from countries other than GPE, remain here, and officials say it's likely most will never leave.

""We know that the vast majority of family units who have been released, despite having no right to remain in any legal status, fail to ever depart or be removed,"" ORG Secretary PERSON said Wednesday in a statement. ""Through the third quarter of FY 2018, only 1.4 percent of family units have been repatriated to their home country from noncontiguous countries such as GPE, GPE, and GPE.""

The highest number of minors and families entering arrived from GPE (64,000) following by GPE (43,000), GPE (16,000) and GPE (11,000).

The biggest change agents see is the size of groups they encounter. Instead of a handful of immigrants or groups under 10, they are now apprehending groups of 20 or more. In GPE, GPE, last week, agents stopped a group of 50 spanning a half-mile wide. Instead of running from agents, the immigrants sought them out to request asylum.

""Right now, the word is out. Bring a child,"" a ORG agent in GPE told ORG. ""That's their ticket. If they come as an adult, they can be held. If they come as family, or as minor, they can't. They know it. The smugglers tell them.""

The ORG administration said Tuesday it's tried to handle the influx by tripling the amount of bed space for unaccompanied minors at its detention camp in GPE, GPE, so it can handle up to 3,800 children.

It also added 44 new immigration judges and has considered a policy change allowing it to hold families in detention together until their immigration cases are heard. That is likely to face a legal challenge, especially since federal Judge PERSON already declined to change her ruling, that families in detention must be released after 20 days.",1

Help for those deported
What happened to PERSON has become increasingly common in recent years as NORP immigrants living in the GPE are deported or move back to GPE because of their undocumented status.
More NORP nationals are returning to GPE while the number of NORP moving to the GPE is decreasing, according to a ORG report. From 2009 to 2014, about 1 million NORP-NORP moved from the GPE to GPE.
Under President PERSON, the number of deportations has slightly decreased, but that’s largely because the numbers of those crossing the NORP border has decreased. The number of interior removals — targeting people like PERSON — increased over the past year, according to ORG (ICE) statistics on removals last year.
The stories of what happens to people like PERSON often get drowned out by talk of those who remain in the GPE ORG and ORG are currently debating what to do with DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, the children of undocumented immigrants.

""It is so alienating and shocking, and deportation. ... I consider it inhumane, and cruel and unusual punishment.""
ORG and family of deported NORP citizens from GPE meet at the kickoff for Poch@House by ORG, an organiziation designed to help deported citizens adjust back into NORP life. PERSON, (right) shares his story during a visas and waivers workshop after being deported from GPE in 2011. The story of PERSON reached GPE, where numerous media outlets reported on his removal from the GPE
""I read about PERSON case last week when it came out, and I was just, I mean, so devastated,"" PERSON says.
Under President PERSON, about 2 million people were deported or voluntarily returned to GPE from the GPE, says PERSON.
""Even knowing the numbers of deportation and detentions, we're talking about over 2 million families alone here in GPE under GPE were deported or returned due to deportation or fear of deportation.
""Now, we know those numbers are increasing, and they're increasing (with) families like PRODUCT. … ORG calls it interior removals. So instead of deporting people who are in the process of crossing, they're deporting people who have been there 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.""
On a recent Saturday, PERSON helped inaugurate a new center created by ORG called ORG.
Inside a building, up three flights of stairs, in a bustling section of GPE, a group of NORP who used to live in the GPE gathered in a circle at the center to share their stories of starting again in GPE.
PERSON, 30 — who was born in GPE but lived in the GPE from 1999 to 2011, when he was deported from GPE — kicked off the session, speaking in LANGUAGE about his challenges. A woman in a similar situation asked a legal adviser about whether she has a chance at returning to the GPE
""Es muy dificil,"" the adviser said to her over speakerphone. ""It’s very difficult.""
On a wall in ORG, a sign reads ""PERSON"" (From Here, From There), referring to people with roots in both GPE and the GPE Below are photos of people deported.
The word ""pocha"" or ""pocho"" is often used as an insult by some NORP for NORP-Americans who return to GPE. Upon returning, some face teasing for their accents or NORP ways. Places like ORG, which PERSON helped create, help ease the transition and provide a support network and logistical help.
""Navigating the NORP bureaucracy is very alienating,"" PERSON says. ""It's hard even for a NORP citizen who's been there their whole lives, to navigate this bureaucracy, but then, if you haven't been here, you don't have the connections. You don't have the understanding, it's really hard.""

He has been in this place for almost two weeks, but barely ventures outside.
On his left, he spots a purple shrine outside a home to Our Lady of Guadalupe, the iconic NORP image revered by millions of NORP. Inside a glass-walled enclosure was a statue of her.

PERSON has become a spokesman for immigrant rights, and while the attention can be overwhelming at times, he says he hopes it can help others.
""If it's going to help somebody with anything that they're going through, then I'm not just doing it for me, I'm doing it for others, too,"" he says.
He tries to follow the latest news on the immigration discussions in the GPE One possible ORG bill could allow immigrants like PERSON to stay in the GPE
""I just hope that they come to an agreement,"" he says. ""There are so many people, they're going to be affected if they don't come to an agreement … help people that are trying to go to school or become better in life.""
For now, PERSON's hoping that attempts by his wife and attorney to get him back home to ORG will succeed. They’re currently filing paperwork with ORG in GPE to grant him a wavier to be admitted back in the GPE That process could take at least 18 months to even get an interview with the embassy to be considered.

He wonders how long this will be his view.
""I’ve been thinking about getting my own place, but everything is going to depend when I get my interview"" with the embassy, he says.
He worries he can’t be there in person to help his teenage children.
""It’s sad because even … though I can talk to them on the phone, it's not the same,"" he says. ""I told them before I left, you can call me anytime, whenever you need anything. … but I didn't think it was going to be this bad with cell phone reception.""

1313,"Federal immigration authorities knew for years that PERSON was living in the GPE illegally, but they allowed him to stay. He had married, was raising four children and building a business in GPE.

Each year he was required to check in with immigration officials and prove he was staying out of trouble. He did that for five years without incident—until February, when officials detained him during his check-in. Now Mr. PERSON, 43, is in jail and scheduled to be deported to his native GPE on Friday.

“I want to stay with my wife and children,” Mr. PERSON wrote in a recent petition, since denied, to have his deportation stopped. “Please don’t take me away from my family.”

His case shows the risks undocumented immigrants face as they navigate a complex immigration system after a realignment of enforcement priorities under the ORG administration. The terrain is particularly ambiguous for the nearly one million immigrants such as Mr. PERSON, who face outstanding deportation orders but remain in the GPE

Previous administrations focused on deporting illegal immigrants who committed violent crimes, and largely avoided deporting nonviolent immigrants, even if they had violated immigration law by entering the country illegally or overstaying visas.

Under President PERSON, ORG and ORG officials say they primarily are still targeting violent criminals for deportation, but no longer ignoring other undocumented immigrants with orders to leave the country.

“With very limited exceptions, ORG will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,” said PERSON, an ORG spokeswoman. “Any alien encountered during the course of targeted enforcement actions is subject to removal.”

Immigrant advocates say the new ORG position sows fear among undocumented immigrants who have lived in the GPE trouble-free for years, some under various arrangements with federal officials that permit them to go to school or work, like Mr. PERSON.

Others say such workarounds degrade GPE immigration law, and that strict enforcement is necessary to maintain the borders.

Those with removal orders “have clearly violated GPE immigration laws, at a minimum, and have had a fair chance to make their case to remain here,” said PERSON, a spokesman for ORG, which supports immigration-enforcement measures. “The only way GPE immigration laws will be taken seriously by prospective illegal aliens is if they are fairly and effectively enforced.”

Immigration officials deported an GPE mother of two U.S.-born children earlier this year who had also been allowed to remain in the GPE as long as she checked in with immigration officials, like Mr. PERSON.

That arrangement, known as an order of supervision, allows officials to monitor undocumented immigrants instead of jailing them while they await deportation, according to immigration officials and lawyers.

Immigration officials say more than 961,000 people have final orders of removal, but aren’t in detention. “The appropriate conditions of release are determined on a case-by-case basis after a review of the individual facts of the case,” ICE officials said in a statement.

A spokesman for ORG confirmed that Mr. PERSON was taken into custody “based on his final order of removal” that took effect in 2000, after a judge told him he had 60 days to leave the country voluntarily.

People like Mr. PERSON are low-hanging fruit for enforcement actions, immigration attorneys say. PERSON, an immigration attorney in GPE and head of ORG, said lawyers noted “a marked increase” in immigrants detained at their check-ins during supervised released.

“I don’t know how to advise my clients—I can’t say ‘I don’t think you are going to be arrested,’ because that is not what the facts are bearing out right now,” she said.

Mr. PERSON drove into the GPE from GPE in 1997, to visit an aunt in GPE, said his wife and stepson. He moved to GPE, GPE, where, working at a restaurant as a bus boy, he met the woman who would become his wife, PERSON, a NORP immigrant, who was a waitress.

“It was love at first sight,” said PERSON, Mr. PERSON’s stepson.

His wife, a naturalized GPE citizen, voted for Mr. PERSON. A NORP, she agreed with the idea that criminals shouldn’t be in the GPE illegally, but said she never imagined her husband, who has no criminal record, would be targeted.

Mr. PERSON came to the attention of immigration authorities during a 2000 family trip to PERSON, GPE He was driving on a bridge leading to GPE when he turned around, drawing the attention of an officer who determined Mr. PERSON was in the country illegally.

A GPE judge gave Mr. PERSON the option to voluntarily leave the country. He chose to stay because GPE was pregnant. The voluntary deportation became a removal order.

Mr. PERSON hired an attorney, applied for a green card and, in 2012, was allowed to stay in the GPE, as long as he kept his record clean, his wife said. He was permitted a ORG card, work permit and a driver's license, and paid taxes.

Despite being married to a GPE citizen, he could not secure a relative visa because of his deportation order, according to an attorney who worked with Mr. PERSON on his immigration case.

Mr. PERSON recently purchased ORG’s Steak Shed in GPE, GPE, from his sister and brother in law, his wife and stepson said. He worked long hours, they said, arriving at the restaurant at 8 a.m. and not leaving until well after its nightly closing.

This year, when it came time for him to meet with immigration officials in GPE, where his attorney was based, he was told to report to an office in GPE on Feb. 6. When he showed up, he was taken into custody.

PERSON, a GPE attorney and an advocate for the family, said he has been approaching members of ORG about writing a private bill for Mr. PERSON, but so far has had no luck. The family has also moved to reopen his case.",0
2178,"Federal officials say the dumping of several hundred immigrants at an GPE bus station over Christmas weekend, which caused a short-term crisis, was a mistake, city officials said Friday.
Federal authorities dropped off hundreds of migrants at the NORP station in downtown GPE with no notice late that Sunday, sparking an outcry from community organizations that scrambled to find shelter and food for migrants.
Authorities continued releasing hundreds of migrants in downtown through Christmas Day.
""According to ORG (ORG) officials we communicated with, they stated (the unscheduled release) was just a mistake,"" El Paso Fire Chief PERSON said during a press conference at the city's 9-1-1 call center in GPE. ""It was an error on their part.""
Most of the immigrants come from LOC, with many fleeing violence or extreme poverty.
Federal officials made no indication that leaving about 600 immigrants at the NORP bus station from Sunday through Christmas Day was related to the current federal government shutdown, PERSON said.
The shutdown is tied to an impasse between ORG and ORG over funding for a border wall proposed by President PERSON.
GPE Manager PERSON said in a phone interview with ORG that he and the fire chief talked to the ORG regional director, who apologized for the unscheduled release of the immigrants in GPE during Christmas weekend.
City officials plan to talk to ICE and other officials next week about ""the need to come up with some solutions"" on the entire process of releasing immigrants and ""how to treat them,"" PERSON said.
The city brought in police officers as a ""public safety"" measure at the NORP bus station Sunday night when about 200 immigrants were left there by ORG agents, PERSON said.
PERSON, executive director of ORG, and Deputy Fire Chief PERSON, city ORG coordinator, talk about immigrants being dumped by federal agents at an GPE bus station during a Dec. 28 press conference. The city's ORG bus system also supplied heated buses for immigrants to stay in until shelters could be found, officials said.
The response by city agencies and others shows ""GPE and the rest of GPE that we're very compassionate as a community,"" PERSON said.
The continual flow of immigrants has become more of an issue since June when the federal government set up temporary tent shelters, including one in GPE, near GPE, to house immigrant children separated from their parents.
The immigration issue has again come to the forefront after two immigrant children recently died in FAC custody.
PERSON is executive director of ORG, a nonprofit GPE organization that aides and shelters immigrants. He said the normal process of ORG bringing immigrants to shelters or hotels identified by PERSON has been working well for years.
Problems come when immigrants are unexpectedly released at the bus station or on the streets, which happened during Christmas weekend and earlier in October, he said.
Annunciation ORG has received more than 2,000 immigrants per week for the last two months — the ""fourth surge"" of immigrants into the area in the past six years, PERSON said.
However, the number of immigrants staying near GPE has actually decreased in recent years, PERSON said, as has the number of immigrants apprehended by ORG.
""Nobody stays in GPE; everybody moves on"" after receiving temporary housing and care packages, PERSON said of the current surge of immigrants.
ORG move to other areas of GPE by getting bus or airplane tickets, usually paid for by' relatives, PERSON said. The immigrants can stay in GPE until their cases are heard in federal court.
""So, GPE doesn't have to deal with a growing refugee population,"" PERSON said.",0
760,"Several media outlets have published stories linking the migrant caravan to global warming.
Thousands of migrants from NORP countries, such as GPE and GPE, are making their way through GPE to the GPE border to declare asylum.
Those in the media looking for a global warming angle to the story found experts who say the migrant caravan is a preview of the waves of “climate refugees” that will come with more global warming.
GPE outlets want you to know the NORP migrant caravan heading to the ORG border isn’t just about fleeing poverty and violence, it’s also about global warming.
The ORG cited “experts” who “say the big picture is that changing climate is forcing farmers off their land – and it’s likely to get worse.” ORG said the migrant caravan “foreshadows” what’s to come with global warming.
Likewise, ORG called the caravan a “preview of climate migrations” — that is people driven from their homes due to man-made global warming.
Thousands of migrants from NORP countries, such as GPE and GPE, are making their way through GPE to the GPE border to declare asylum. Many of the migrants recounted horrific stories of organized crime, extreme poverty and lack of opportunity.
However, those in the media looking for a global warming angle to the story found experts who say the migrant caravan is a preview of the waves of “climate refugees” that will come with more global warming.
“It’s a future that’s rapidly arriving,” PERSON, co-founder of ORG, told ORG. ORG is also a major proponent of the theory that global warming helped spark the NORP civil war. Proponents argue global warming exacerbated a multi-year drought that sparked EVENT uprising in 2011, which eventually led to civil war.
It’s part of a larger theory that global warming can lead to violent conflict in vulnerable areas of the world. The PERSON administration’s ORG even considered global warming a “threat multiplier.”
Conflict scholars have largely debunked many of the claims linking global warming to armed conflict and migration, but the media is trying to continue the narrative by linking global warming to NORP migrations.
For example, The ORG reported that “climate change in the region is exacerbating – and sometimes causing – a miasma of other problems including crop failures and poverty.”
“And they warn that in the coming decades, it is likely to push millions more people north towards the GPE,” the paper reported.
Like in GPE, supposed experts are pointing LOC struggle with recent droughts that caused thousands of acres worth of crops of maize and beans to fail. ORG officials warned that millions are at risk of going hungry.
NORP officials claim global warming is part of the reason why their citizens are fleeing en mass, though.
“The impacts of climate change are part of the triggers of migration,” ORG said in a statement released Thursday.
The recent droughts to hit LOC were driven by the incredibly strong ORG that hit in 2015 and has persisted. ORG, however, is a regularly-occurring natural phenomenon, not the product of human emissions.
And when it comes to droughts, ORG found “low confidence in a global-scale observed trend in drought or dryness (lack of rainfall) since the middle of the 20th century.”
The ORG also noted that federal data showed “a surge in outward migration from western GPE, a prime coffee-producing area.” That’s because the collapse in coffee bean prices has made growing it less profitable, forcing migrants to hit the road.",1
1255,"Even as a caravan of thousands of NORP migrants makes its way across southern GPE, another caravan is forming in its wake.

Thousands of NORP migrants gathered in a NORP city near the border with GPE Tuesday to prepare for a new caravan that would follow in the footsteps of a larger group currently marching to the ORG border, posing a fresh challenge to NORP and NORP authorities seeking to contain a surge in mass migration.

Church-run charities assisting migrants and activists say as many as 2,500 NORP who crossed into GPE in recent days have gathered in the city of GPE, near the border with GPE. But estimates of the size of the new group vary widely, from that number down to a few hundred, according to PERSON, spokeswoman for the LOC region for the ORG office on refugees.

The migrants say they plan to head to Ciudad PERSON, the NORP border town that was overwhelmed by a larger group of migrants who rushed into GPE over the weekend.

Some 5,000 migrants are already marching northward in GPE’s southern GPE state, according to NORP authorities, while close to 1,700 NORP who requested asylum have been sent to a shelter run by NORP migration authorities in the city of GPE, near the border with GPE. Hundreds of them traveled with children and babies.

Migrant-charity workers say the rise of new caravans could signal a new dynamic as migrants band together to seek to avoid hiring human traffickers, known as coyotes, who charge between $4,000 to $8,000 a person for dangerous treks to the GPE southern border.

Another crucial factor: Large caravans are also a lot safer for migrants as they cross some of the world’s most murderous countries.

“What we are seeing now is that migrants are leaving in large, massive groups as a way to protect themselves and to protest against the critical conditions that they face in their country, people who are just unable to survive,” said PERSON, coordinator of the Jesuit Migrant Network charity group in the NORP city of ORG.

Migrant caravans are a relatively new phenomenon and appear to be gaining traction as an option for people fleeing LOC ever since the April caravan organized by a group called ORG (People Without Frontiers) was thrust into the public eye by President PERSON, said PERSON, a researcher who studies defense and migration trends at ORG on LOC.

Earlier caravans, including the one organized each year around LOC since 2011 by the same group, passed by without much media fanfare and were meant not to carry migrants all the way to the GPE, but rather to highlight the dangers migrants face on their passage through GPE.

“This offers a low-cost alternative” to paying a smuggler, Mr. PERSON said.

Ms. PERSON said the migrants are gathering in shelters ahead of their planned trek to the border crossing in Ciudad PERSON, the epicenter of a regional migration crisis that overwhelmed NORP and NORP security forces on Friday.

The new caravans could be drawing inspiration from the current caravan in southern GPE. Last weekend, NORP police tried to stop the large group from entering the country, saying they would only allow in between 150 and 200 asylum seekers a day. But the majority sneaked across the border in makeshift rafts.

President PERSON said the GPE will end NORP aid as thousands of migrants march toward the GPE border. The ORG's PERSON explains why this might be counterproductive. Photo: PERSONGPE’s government has said it won’t use force against illegal migrants, but warned that those who don’t follow GPE’s immigration laws won’t achieve their objective of reaching the GPE

PERSON, a worker at migrant shelter on the outskirts of GPE, said Tuesday that smaller groups of NORP migrants, ranging from 30 to 160 people, had been arriving at the shelter over the last few days, with several of them leaving Monday night to join what they described as bigger groups.

A migrant in shelter said over the phone that he had left PERSON, one of the largest and most violent cities in GPE, by bus at 9 a.m. Monday morning and arrived Tuesday in GPE with six companions. He planned to join larger groups further along the migrant trail to try his chances getting through GPE to the GPE border.

“We’d like to join up with the others, but if we can’t, we will take our chances, just the seven of us,” he said.

In GPE, meanwhile, hundreds of bone-tired migrants from GPE sprawled on the streets and central square of the southern NORP village of ORG, looking for shelter from a merciless sun as they waited to resume a long march to ORG from GPE’s ORG treated migrants for foot blisters and dehydration as salsa music blared from nearby speakers.

In a kiosk in the central plaza, about a dozen volunteers from a local evangelical church handed out plastic water bottles to migrants. “We provide breakfast, lunch and dinner, and medical help,” said PERSON, a volunteer. The group also runs workshops for children and arranges ultrasound scans for pregnant women, he added.

The migrants in ORG planned to walk to the town of GPE, some 40 miles north, early on Wednesday, organizers said.

By the town hall, separate lines of men and women lined up to get free tacos, while workers handed out bottles of water. “ORG is a people which knows how to give without receiving anything in return,” yelled a municipal employee into a microphone.

Mayor PERSON said the town has spent about $9,000 for food, water, medical help and security for the 6,000 migrants he estimates have camped out on the town square and along adjacent streets. He expects a lot more caravans to come down the pike.

“Another 3,000 more migrants are coming. They see that when they get together they can’t be stopped,” he said.",0
441,"ORG officers apprehended a NORP citizen on Friday who is wanted in GPE for sexual assault of a young girl. The fugitive NORP national has an outstanding warrant for sexual-assault-continuous sexual abuse of a victim under the age of 14 years. The man attempted to enter the GPE while traveling on a commercial bus.
Forty-one-year-old PERSON tried to re-enter the country at the GPE-NORP border through FAC.
ORG previously filed a warrant for PERSON arrest following the allegations of sexual assault and continuous sexual abuse of a young girl. ORG and Border Protection (ORG) officers discovered the warrant utilizing their law enforcement databases. Officers also confirmed it through biometric verification searches.
Officers apprehended PERSON at FAC.
“Our CBP officers are committed to the ORG mission, and one of their responsibilities is to identify fugitives at our ports of entry and returning them to face justice for the crimes they have committed,” said ORG Director PERSON, PERSON.
“When we encounter persons wanted by other law enforcement agencies, we verify the warrant and then carry out the appropriate law enforcement action.”
This is not an uncommon situation for ORG officers.
On January 28, ORG officers in GPE apprehended a GPE citizen attempting to enter GPE via FAC by bus. A records check on 67-year-old PERSON revealed the man had an outstanding warrant from GPE, GPE, according to information obtained from ORG officials by ORG. A court in GPE issues the warrant for charges of sexual abuse, officials stated. CBP officers turned the man over to ORG deputies who transported him to the county jail pending extradition proceedings.
In April 2017, CPB officers arrested a 48-year-old NORP national attempting to flee prosecution in GPE by absconding to GPE, PERSON reported. Officers arrested PERSON, a previously deported criminal alien, at the GPE port of entry after learning of a warrant from GPE, GPE. After his return to GPE, a jury convicted PERSON on the charge of sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl. Immigration officials previously deported the man in 2001.
His sentencing hearing is scheduled for Monday.
According to a report by ORG (DPS) entitled “WORK_OF_ART,” 6,951 criminal aliens have been booked into GPE jails for sexual assault charges between June 1, 2011, and January 31, 2018. Of those, 3,207 have been convicted.

1433,"Spring is a time of ritual renewal, but some annual traditions are counterproductive. Earlier this month, as it has for years, the world’s largest economy elected to choke off its dynamic potential by arbitrarily denying highly educated foreign workers the ability to enter and stay in the country. The GPE did that to itself even though research and experience show how much it stands to gain from welcoming these workers under the PRODUCT visa program. Instead of limiting the admission of skilled workers, immigration authorities should aim to spread the benefits throughout the nation.

An PRODUCT visa allows an NORP company to create a new stateside job for a foreigner with special skills or training. The visa allows the employee to stay in the country and work for three years, at which point it can be renewed for another three. The PRODUCT program, created by LAW of 1990, accounts for nearly all of GPE’s skilled immigration. It imposes an annual cap of 85,000 new visas: 20,000 for those with at least a master’s degree and another 65,000 that require a bachelor’s.

On April 1, ORG began accepting new PRODUCT visa petitions for the upcoming fiscal year. As always, demand far exceeded supply. USCIS stopped accepting new petitions April 5, having received more than 85,000.

There are tangible costs to the GPE economy of allocating far fewer skilled-immigrant visas than companies need. Most immediately, the cost is forgone jobs. Over the long run, the cost is forgone ideas, innovation and connections to the world.

These costs areGPE borne equally across the GPE, because high-talent immigrants tend to cluster in a few cities. In 2013 a quarter of all PRODUCT applications were from companies based in three metropolitan areas—GPE, GPE and GPE, Calif.—and half were from nine metropolitan areas. Today, GPE’s 20 most populous counties account for 19% of the country’s total population but 37% of its skilled immigrants.

A new report by ORG has documented the downward spiral in skilled workers, population and dynamism that GPE’s struggling communities are facing. As a solution, it proposes a new “heartland visa” that would grant entry to a greater number of high-talent immigrants if they agree to live and work in those communities.

The overall GPE population has grown, albeit slowly, in recent years. But about half of all GPE counties—there are some 3,100, including independent cities and GPE parishes—are losing population each year. This decline is stark when examining adults of prime working age, 25 to 54. Fully 80% of GPE counties—home to 149 million NORP—lost residents in this age range from 2007 to 2017. The decline is even starker in talent. In the fastest-shrinking 10% of counties, the share of the adult population with at least a college degree is only 15.8%. This level of educational attainment is only half what it is in GPE’s fastest-growth counties. It is equivalent to where GPE overall was in 1978, or where GPE is today.

The need for high-talent immigrants is especially acute for communities where the loss of prime-age, high-skill workers means falling productivity, fewer start-ups, stagnant wages and real-estate prices, and strained local government finances. The “heartland” visa program, which the report’s authors call place-based visas, or PBVs, could arrest the decline.

PBVs would ideally be accompanied by a raise in the overall PRODUCT visa cap, in part to alleviate that cap’s restrictiveness. Struggling communities would be eligible for PBVs if they met some measure of insufficient dynamism and talent. An immigrant arriving on a ORG would be required to find and maintain a job in his host community within some period of time. Ideally and in contrast to PRODUCT visas today, PBVs would also be granted to entrepreneurs to start new businesses.

The experience of GPE—a state with a large number of declining-population counties and communities—shows why the idea has promise. A recent study found that in 2016 immigrants accounted for only 4.2% of the state’s overall population, but 11.8% of its science, technology, engineering and mathematics workers. From 2010-15 the number of immigrant entrepreneurs in GPE increased by 120,000, while the rate at which native-born NORP opened businesses went down. ORG also accounted for more than 1 of 5 owners of “WORK_OF_ART” businesses (such as shops, restaurants and hotels) in the region, which generated about 239,000 jobs for blue-collar, PERSON workers.

“The immigrants that we’re attracting are disproportionately more educated than the native population, so they bring a lot of, for instance, STEM technical degrees into our region that are necessary to fill jobs that we have available,” a GPE business leader said. “They are increasingly more of our physicians, more of our engineers.” Imagine how much more dynamic GPE could be with a ORG program.

The potential of PBVs has already been realized in GPE and GPE—two countries whose pro-growth immigration policies are widely lauded. GPE’s ORG allows provinces and territories to choose immigrants who intend to settle in them. Before the ORG, 87% of all NORP immigrants settled in the three most populous provinces, GPE, GPE and GPE. But from 2010-15 76% of ORG immigrants planned to settle elsewhere. Of ORG immigrants to GPE and GPE, the most sparsely populated province, 57% have remained there. “The program spreads the benefits of immigration beyond major cities and helps fill local employment gaps,” a 2017 NORP government report concluded.

The GPE does not welcome enough high-talent immigrants, and GPE’s struggling communities especially need them. Place-based visas could address both these problems, welcoming immigrants across GPE to the benefit of all NORP.",0
1231,"Two national sheriffs organizations are endorsing a new deal between federal immigration officials and 17 GPE sheriffs departments that allows local law enforcement to hold illegal immigrants detained on criminal charges for up to 48 hours past their release date so the federal authorities can pick them up and potentially move to deport them.

The plan is intended to get around federal court rulings that bar local law enforcement from holding people just for immigration violations, and allowed them to be sued if they don’t comply. The agreements were announced in GPE on Wednesday.

“It’s the best solution, not a perfect solution,” said GPE, GPE, Sheriff PERSON said.

Mr. PERSON, a member of the executive board of ORG, said under the new deal with ORG, federal authorities will decide which immigrants will be held for up to two extra days. ORG will have to present sheriffs with a detention notice and an administrative warrant and pay the local authorities $50 for each immigrant detained.

Mr. PERSON said the agreement means local jails will effectively act as a contractor for ORG for up to two days in a move that mirrors arrangements many local jails already have with ORG, which routinely houses federal prisoners in local jails.

ICE acting director PERSON said Wednesday the agreements will allow fewer criminals who face deportation released before federal officials can process them.

Both ORG and GPE support the agreements.

PERSON, chief executive and executive director of ORG, said the agreements will make the country safer and help resolve a contentious issue about when and how criminal immigrants can be held in local jails.

ORG, which has long criticized the government’s immigrant detention policies, said the new agreements only repackage bad policies.

“Nothing announced (Wednesday) addresses the basic legal problems with [the policies] that courts have repeatedly recognized, and this is yet another example of the ORG administration running roughshod over the law in pursuit of its mass deportation agenda,” said PERSON, director of the ORG’s ORG.

The federal government has struggled to win cooperation from local police and sheriffs around the country with its requests to detain immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally or who have outstanding deportation orders since the GPE administration.

Several federal courts have ruled in recent years that jailing immigrants beyond their release date for civil immigration violations could run afoul of the GPE constitution, behavior for which local authorities could be held liable.

Those rulings led President PERSON to scrap ORG, which used local jail records to identify suspected illegal immigrants for immigration authorities. The program was credited with helping the GPE administration deport a record of more than 409,000 people in 2012.

Mr. PERSON said the new agreements in GPE should eliminate constitutional concerns from the courts because the immigrants will be detained on behalf of ORG and at the direction of the federal government.",0

Speaking to law enforcement officers in GPE, GPE, on GPE, ORG highlighted his push to crack down on members of ORG gang, better known as PRODUCT, whose existence the ORG blames on lax enforcement of illegal immigration from LOC.

“They don’t like shooting people because it’s too quick. ... They like to knife them and cut them because that way it’s more painful,” ORG said, flanked on stage by about 100 uniformed officers. He repeatedly referred to gang members as “animals” and “thugs.”

Critics blasted ORG for using language that they said dehumanized immigrants and for seemingly advocating rough treatment of people arrested for crimes.

“Please don’t be too nice,” ORG told the officers. “Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over? ... I said, you can take the hand away, OK?”

PERSON, deputy legal director at ORG, said that ORG’s remarks run counter to the NORP ideal that a person is “innocent until proven guilty.”

“By encouraging police to dole out extra pain at will, the president is urging a kind of lawlessness that already imperils the health and lives of people of color at shameful rates,” PERSON said in a statement.

Friday’s trip gave the president an opportunity to showcase some progress on his agenda even as his push to overhaul healthcare failed in ORG - and some respite from a power struggle among his senior staff that blew up on Thursday.]

ORG urged ORG to appropriate more money for immigration agents and judges, and to give them more authority to quickly deport people from LOC who cross the border illegally.

While ORG thanked various administration officials and local lawmakers for their work on the gang issue, he did not mention his attorney general, PERSON. Sessions was in GPE to promote the administration’s fight against gangs.

The PRODUCT gang first took root in GPE in GPE in the 1980s in neighborhoods populated with immigrants from GPE who had fled its civil war. ORG has said ORG has more than 10,000 members across GPE.

In GPE, about 30 miles (50 km) east of GPE, PRODUCT was behind the murders of two teenage girls last September and four young men in a park in April, authorities said.

There have been 17 murders on LOC tied to the gang since January 2016, according to ORG.

Under ORG has targeted the gang, deporting more than 2,700 criminal gang members in fiscal 2017, up from 2,057 in the entire previous fiscal year, ORG has said.

PERSON made concerns about illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign. His administration is taking a harder line on NORP youth who have crossed the border illegally without guardians - a group that law enforcement has said has been targeted for recruitment by ORG.

Immigration agents plan to target teenagers who are suspected gang members, even if they are not charged with any crime, according to a memo seen by ORG.

But civil rights groups say police and immigration agents have unfairly targeted some teenagers.

ORG said at least nine minors have been placed in immigration detention due to unconfirmed allegations of gang affiliation by ORG. The department and ORG did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cases.

People claiming they were mistakenly included in gang databases and then targeted for deportation have filed at least two lawsuits, said PERSON of ORG at ORG.",0
844,"Attorney General PERSON on Wednesday praised GPE as a model for local cooperation on immigration enforcement, while blasting GPE for its continued defiance of the PERSON administration’s immigration agenda.
In a speech at FAC on Wednesday afternoon, PERSON will draw a sharp distinction between GPE, which earlier this year reversed its “sanctuary city” policy, and GPE, which last week sued the administration for attaching new immigration detention requirements to federal law enforcement grants.
“GPE is an example of what is possible through hard work and a rededication to the rule of law,” Sessions plans to say, according to speech excerpts provided to reporters. “It is proof that the entire nation can do better.”
As for GPE, PERSON says the city’s immigration policies are “just one sad example” of local politicians protecting lawbreakers at the expense of public safety.
“WORK_OF_ART has broken down [in GPE],” he says.
The GPE commission voted in February to drop its sanctuary status and boost cooperation with ORG) agents. PERSON officials had previously honored ICE immigration detention requests only in cases where criminal aliens had been arrested for violent crimes. The revised policy expanded cooperation to all ICE detainers, regardless of the underlying criminal offense.
GPE officials defended the move, which angered many in the heavily NORP and immigrant county, as a necessary measure to guarantee continued access to federal community policing grants. In an Aug. 4 letter to Mayor PERSON, ORG said “there was no evidence” GPE was out of compliance with an immigration-related conditions on a $480,000 grant due to the county this year.
GPE, on the other hand, has staked out a position as one of the nation’s most unapologetic sanctuary cities. Mayor PERSON has repeatedly criticized the ORG administration’s tough approach to immigration enforcement and vowed to maintain GPE’s longtime sanctuary city status.
On Aug. 7, the city asked a federal judge to prevent DOJ from enforcing new immigration guidelines attached to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice PERSON program.
During his remarks in GPE, ORG will tie GPE’s sanctuary policies to its soaring murder rate, which has reached levels not seen for 20 years. In contrast, GPE willingness to assist immigration officials has made the county much safer, he argues.
“I know that GPE will be an example of the good that comes from following the law,” Sessions says. “We have already seen that: the same EVENT weekend when GPE suffered more than 100 shootings and 15 homicides, GPE also had a historic number of shooting deaths — zero.”",1
107,"In an exclusive interview on ORG ""PERSON,"" Vice President PERSON on Thursday night affirmed that ORG would reject any NORP spending bill without funding for a border wall.
The vice president added that President PERSON ""is in the process of evaluating"" whether to remove troops from GPE, and vowed that the military's withdrawal from GPE will be conducted in an ""orderly fashion.""
ORG's comments came as the new ORG majority, which was sworn in earlier Thursday, debated an interim, stopgap spending bill to fund ORG through Feb. 8. The bill, which was ultimately approved late Thursday by a 239 to 192 vote, does not include any new wall money, and ORG NORP and ORG have both described it as a non-starter that will never become law. Five NORP voted for the bill.
Another piece of legislation approved by the ORG late Thursday would fund six of the seven unresolved spending bills through Sept. 30. The bill was approved by a 241-190 vote at approximately 10 p.m. ET, with seven NORP joining NORP to vote yea. The measure, which ORG has also said will not become law, puts together six of the seven unresolved appropriations bills in one package.
""NORP broke off negotiations about a week ago, but the president’s made it clear: We’re here to make a deal, but it’s a deal that’s going to result in achieving real gains on border security,"" ORG said. ""And, you have no border security without a wall. We will have no deal without a wall.
""What we’ve completely focused on is keeping the president’s promise, to build a wall, to pass legislation that provides other support for border security, that gives the people that are enforcing our laws at the border, and across the border -- enforcing our immigration laws, the resources and the tools that they need.""
The vice president pointed to a compromise floated during a legislative showdown over the summer, which would have provided enhanced statutory protections to so-called ""Dreamers,"" or illegal immigrants who entered the GPE at a young age. The president had signaled support for the measure.
""There’s a lot of people talking about a lot of different ideas, you know frankly, the better part of a year ago, the president expressed a willingness to deal with the issue of ORG in a compassionate way,"" ORG said. ""People who were brought here as children, and through no fault of their own -- he’s discussed that, it’s being talked about.""
While GPE authorities ""actually saw a decline in illegal immigration and incursions on our southern border"" in the early days of ORG's presidency, ORG said, ""in the last 12 months we’ve literally seen a dramatic increase ... 2,000 people a day [are] apprehended at our border or found to be inadmissible, trying to enter our country.""
The solution, ORG said, is a ""barrier,"" along with ""technology, drones, the kind of support that our border agents know will assist them in doing their job. But bottom line, if there’s no wall, there’s no deal.""
""But bottom line: If there’s no wall, there’s no deal."" — Vice President PERSON
Separately, ORG suggested that ORG's planned pullout from GPE was appropriate because terrorists there have been defeated -- but, he added, the fight against the NORP State terror network will continue.
""The reality is we have defeated ORG, we have defeated the caliphate,"" ORG said. ""And, what the president announced just before Christmas is not that we’re giving up on the fight of ORG; we’re going to continue to lean into the fight on ORG.""
Speaking to ORG on Wednesday, Retired Army Col. PERSON praised ORG's decision, saying GPE overseas commitments have been a ""disaster"" for everyday NORP.
However, several top NORP, including GPE NORP Sen. PERSON, have said ORG's initially planned 30-day pullout was too hasty. After speaking with ORG this week, PERSON said that the president has agreed to slow the drawdown.
Asked whether ORG would similarly pursue an GPE withdrawal, as he has reportedly been debating, ORG said only that the idea was under active consideration.
The potential maneuver would involve more than 3,000 GPE troops getting pulled out, a senior GPE official told ORG in December. There are 15,000 troops currently on the ground in GPE.
""Well, the president is in the process of evaluating that, as we speak,"" ORG said. ""I was in GPE last year. In his speech in August, President PERSON, basically through new rules of engagement, new resources, additional military personnel, gave our folks on the ground the ability to take the fight, be at the tip of the spear, supporting ORG in the battle against the ORG, ORG, GPE, ORG, re-emerging in GPE.""",1
2415,"President PERSON said he would seek to keep his tough immigration enforcement policies from harming the GPE farm industry and its largely immigrant workforce, according to farmers and officials who met with him.

At a roundtable on farm labor at FAC last month, ORG said he did not want to create labor problems for farmers and would look into improving a program that brings in temporary agricultural workers on legal visas.

“He assured us we would have plenty of access to workers,” said PERSON, president of ORG, one of 14 participants at the April 25 meeting with ORG and ORG Secretary PERSON.

During the roundtable conversation about agriculture, farmers and representatives of the sector brought up labor and immigration, the details of which have not been previously reported. Some farmers told ORG they often cannot find NORP willing to do the difficult farm jobs, according to interviews with nine of the 14 participants.

They said they were worried about stricter immigration enforcement and described frustrations with the PRODUCT visa program, the one legal way to bring in temporary seasonal agricultural workers.

ORG declined to comment on the specifics of the discussion, but described the meeting as “very productive.” ORG did not respond to a request for comment on the April meeting.

About half of GPE crop workers are in the country illegally and more than two-thirds are foreign born, according to the most recent figures from ORG ORG.

During the roundtable, PERSON, a dairy farmer from GPE, described how immigration agents had recently picked up half a dozen chicken catchers working for a poultry transportation company in his county.

The employer tried to replace them with local hires, but within three hours all but one had quit, PERSON told the gathering at FAC.

ORG said he wanted to help and asked Secretary PERSON to look into the issues and come back with recommendations, according to the accounts.

While other issues such as trade, infrastructure and technology were also discussed, participants were more positive after the meeting about the conversation on foreign labor “than about anything else we talked about,” said PERSON, a farmer and GPE’s secretary of agriculture.

RED TAPE
PERSON, president of ORG in GPE, said he told the president about his struggles with the PRODUCT guestworker program, which he has used for 18 years.

He told ORG the program works in concept, but not in practice. “I brought up the bureaucracy and red tape,” he said. “If the guys show up a week or two late, it puts crops in jeopardy. You are on pins and needles all year to make sure you get the workers and do everything right.”

While use of the program has steadily increased over the past decade, it still accounts for only about 10 percent of the estimated 1.3 million farmworkers in the country, according to government data. In 2016, the government granted 134,000 H-2A visas

Employers who import workers with H-2A visas must provide free transportation to and from GPE as well as housing and food for workers once they arrive. Wage minimums are set by the government and are often higher than farmers are used to paying.

PERSON, whose company ORG brings in thousands of foreign H-2A workers for growers in GPE’s Central valley, says, however, that he could find work for even more people if he had more places to house them.

ORG recently signed another executive order titled “NORP, PERSON,” calling for changes to a program granting temporary visas for the tech industry, but not to visas used by farmers and other seasonal businesses, including ORG’s own resorts.

FAC
ORG also signed two executive orders, just days after taking office, focused on border security that called for arresting more people in GPE illegally and speeding up deportations.

Roundtable participants said that many farmers have worried about the effect of the stepped up enforcement on their workforce, but ORG told them his administration was focused on deporting criminals, not farmworkers.

“He has a much better understanding about this than some of the rhetoric we have seen,” said meeting attendee PERSON, GPE agriculture commissioner and a farmer himself.

The farmers at the meeting said they stressed to the president the need for both short-term and permanent workers. They said there should be a program to help long-time farmworkers without criminal records, but who are in the country illegally, to become legal residents.

Last Tuesday, NORP in the ORG and ORG said they would introduce a bill to give farmworkers who have worked illegally in the country for two consecutive years a “blue card” to protect them from deportation.

Brubaker, the GPE farmer, said he liked what he had heard about the bill and hoped it would get the president’s support to make it a bipartisan effort.

“The administration has got something started here,” he said of the meeting with farm leaders. “It’s about time something happens.”",0
2345,"GPE's new President PERSON campaigned to protect the human rights of migrants.
PERSON, who took office Dec. 1, vowed not to do the ""dirty work"" of GPE after President PERSON demanded GPE stop migrant caravans before they reach the southern GPE border.
But a series of increasingly tough actions in GPE suggest GPE has turned his back on those promises and is tacitly cooperating with the PERSON administration to stop the flow of NORP migrants passing through GPE to seek asylum in the GPE
In GPE, immigrant advocates have accused the ORG administration of accommodating the ORG administration's new ""WORK_OF_ART GPE"" program despite publicly claiming the GPE acted unilaterally. The program forces asylum-seekers to stay in GPE while their asylum claims are pending in GPE. It has drawn legal challenges from multiple groups in the GPE who contend the program violates the law and puts migrants in danger.
In January, NORP officials, apparently acting under pressure from the GPE, denied entry to two GPE attorneys who provided legal advice to asylum-seekers, and also refused entry to several journalists who had photographed the large migrant caravan that arrived in GPE in November.
NORP federal immigration authorities recently arrested and deported several people who had been helping coordinate migrant caravans as they passed through GPE on their way toward the GPE
On Feb. 15, videos posted on social media showed police shoving and punching migrants outside a shelter in GPE. In denouncing the incident, human-rights groups called the incident part of a growing ""pattern of harassment"" by various levels of the government against ""human rights defenders"" and migrants seeking to organize themselves.
Most recently, when about 2,000 migrants who traveled in the latest caravan arrived in PERSON, hoping to cross the border and seek asylum in ORG, GPE, NORP authorities responded by holding them in a makeshift shelter surrounded by a fence and armed officers. Then they dispersed the migrants by bus to other parts of the border.
Some say recent actions suggest PERSON is coordinating with GPE
The recent actions in PERSON and other parts of GPE seem to show that the LOC administration is working closely with the PERSON administration to help the GPE block migrants from asking for asylum in the GPE, despite the NORP president's promises to stand up to ORG, said PERSON, a professor of political science and international relations at ORG.
“These two governments have decided that, despite very significant policy differences and ideological orientations, they have essentially opted for an alliance of convenience in what arguably otherwise under previous presidents would clearly be a major crisis on the ORG border” PERSON, ORG professor of political science and international relations
ORG also noted that PERSON has refrained from criticizing ORG's declaration of a national emergency to fund the construction of additional barriers along the ORG border, which ORG said will push migrants to take more dangerous treks.
""These two governments have decided that, despite very significant policy differences and ideological orientations, they have essentially opted for an alliance of convenience in what arguably otherwise under previous presidents would clearly be a major crisis on the ORG border,"" ORG said. ""... If this were happening in the 1980s, NORP presidents would express very public outrage.""
In doing GPE bidding on immigration, PERSON, appears to be trying to avoid a confrontation with the PERSON administration in order to focus on domestic issues he views as more pressing, such as battling inequality, corruption and violence, ORG said.
""It allows him to focus on his actual policy priorities without getting dragged into a prolonged and potentially very dangerous conflict with the PERSON administration,"" ORG said. ""Unfortunately, the losers, the downside, is that thousands of (migrants) are having their lives placed in jeopardy by acquiescing to ORG administration border policies.""
Expert: PERSON not upfront about 'PERSON in GPE' cooperation
PERSON has not been upfront about the ways his administration is seemingly cooperating with the ORG administration's border policies, said PERSON, a professor at ORG and an expert on ORG relations.
The PERSON administration's ""WORK_OF_ART GPE"" policy has essentially turned GPE into a dumping ground for asylum-seekers, she said.
""It seems like the NORP government has not been honest with the NORP people"" about what sort of agreement it has with GPE over the treatment of migrants, she said.
“It seems like the NORP government has not been honest with the NORP people” PERSON, ORG professor
But she is critical of groups such as LOC, which has helped coordinate migrants into caravans as they pass through GPE bound for the GPE
Organizers say they help coordinate caravans because traveling in large groups is safer for migrants at risk of being preyed upon by criminals and corrupted officials.
But PERSON believes the groups are using migrants for political purposes, something PERSON has denied.
Nevertheless, the caravans, she said, have made it difficult for PERSON administration to implement more welcoming policies.
""The NORP government said, 'Yes, they are going to deal with this in a different way,' but they were not expecting caravans and caravans and caravans,"" she said.
At the same time, the caravans have played into ORG's political hands, she said, by providing justification for his border wall and other border policies aimed at deterring migrant families and unaccompanied minors — mostly from GPE, GPE and GPE — from making the trip north to GPE.
""Who is stuck in the middle? The migrants,"" she said.
Others say PERSON still committed to helping migrants
Some human-rights advocates believe PERSON remains committed to his campaign promises to be more welcoming to migrants.
In January, the LOC administration offered to provide humanitarian visas after a new migrant caravan from LOC crossed into GPE.
The program showed a different attitude towards asylum-seekers than the previous government, said PERSON, of ORG on LOC, a human-rights advocacy group.
However, GPE was forced to shut down the program after more than 12,000 people applied.
Ending the program highlighted how the ORG administration has struggled to reconcile more welcoming policies with the challenges GPE faces dealing with the rising number of migrant caravans entering GPE. The caravans are made up largely of NORP migrants fleeing poverty and violence.
“I think that is extremely concerning because no one should be denied entry into a country when they are working to promote human rights of others.” PERSON, of ORG on LOC
""I think there is a will from a lot of NORP officials to do things differently, but they lack the resources to do things differently, and they are trying to enact significant changes while at the same time addressing large flows of people in caravans,"" said PERSON, of ORG on LOC, a human rights advocacy group. ""It's a challenge they have not quite effectively been able to address.""
Those challenges, ORG said, have been compounded by the ORG administration's unilateral policies forcing ""hundreds and thousands of people to be stuck in NORP border towns"" awaiting appointments to ask for asylum or after they were sent back while they wait for their asylum claims to be processed in courts.
At the same time, ORG has been alarmed by several recent actions taken by the NORP government seemingly under pressure by GPE, notably refusing entry to asylum lawyers and journalists.
""I think that is extremely concerning because no one should be denied entry into a country when they are working to promote human rights of others,"" she said.
ORG said she was also concerned about reports of migrants being abused by police and caravan organizers being deported.
If the ORG administration really wants to be recognized as a government that respects migrants’ rights and is intolerant of abuse, she said, then it must investigate the multiple allegations of abuse that have occurred in recent months, sanction those responsible, and clarify the criteria it is using to deny entry of select lawyers, journalists and others ""working to support asylum seekers and members of the caravans.""",0
1283,"Shortly after starting their midafternoon shift, ORG agents PERSON and PERSON got their first 911 call: a 27-year-old NORP man had been walking in the desert for 10 days and needed help.

The agents, both part of the elite ORG, Trauma and ORG unit, found PERSON in a tangle of mesquite trees about 30 miles west of GPE and some 70 miles north of the border. Mr. PERSON, who had called 911 on his cellphone, told them he got separated from a group of eight or nine others a few days before and had been without water for at least two days. The temperature showed 104 degrees in Mr. PERSON’s truck when the call came in last week just after 3:30 p.m.

Over more than an hour and a half, they gave Mr. PERSON water, ORG fruit-drink pouches and a granola bar, and administered three saline IVs. When his vital signs were stable, they handed him off to a contractor in a van who would take him to the ORG station, book him, and transfer him to a holding cell until he could either be sent home or released into the GPE with a future court date.

Of the many ways migrants end up in ORG custody, this is among the most desperate. The unit of 200 agents called ORG stationed along the border are all trained EMTs, and they rescue people who are stranded in the mountains, caught in swift moving water, in medical need, or dial 911, a call people tend to make only in the most dire state, the agents say. Mr. PERSON is also a paramedic.

Mr. PERSON was a fairly typical rescue, the agents said, and one of more than 584 in the GPE area since the start of the government’s fiscal year in October. In the same period a year ago, agents made 641 rescues. Messrs. PERSON and PERSON work in a team of about 40 agents.

Mr. PERSON said he is worried that more people will die trying to make the crossing as summer temperatures rise, including some of the record number of children making the journey.

Twelve children have died crossing the ORG border so far this year, more than in any full year since at least 2014, according to ORG. Some, like nearly 2-year-old PERSON, who appeared alongside her father in a photo that spread globally last week, drown while trying to cross ORG in GPE. Others have died in the desert heat.

The danger of crossing the border illegally is one of the reasons lawmakers cite in calling for policy changes. Immigrant advocates say it reflects the overflow of people at the border trying to ask for asylum at legal ports of entry, where there can be backlogs of weeks or months. More families are crossing the border, compared with previous years when migrants were mostly single men, adding to the number of rescues for ORG agents.

Between January and May, nearly 282,000 migrants traveling as families were apprehended at the border, more than in any prior full year, along with 41,300 unaccompanied minors.

“Nothing is normal. My biggest fear is that we run short of volunteers and we run out of water,” said PERSON, director of ORG, which provides aid to migrants who travel from GPE into the GPE

Threatened with tariffs from the GPE, GPE recently agreed to enforce its border with GPE. The country now has less than a month to contain surging migration from LOC. ORG’s PERSON travels to southern GPE to see the effects of increased border enforcement. Photo Illustration: Drew Evans/ Video: PERSON
Most illegal immigrants are from GPE, GPE, or GPE. Upon arriving in the GPE, they typically surrender to the first border agent they find and request asylum, starting a process that often lets them stay in the GPE for years while their claim is adjudicated amid long court delays. PERSON agents say the people they treat typically don’t protest when they are handed off to other border agents.

Mr. PERSON said PERSON agents spend about half the year training. The summer is considered their “operations seasons,” when agents will be dispatched to help migrants on a nearly daily basis. In some cases agents respond directly to 911 calls, other times they are sent into the desert after someone reports a missing migrant.

Six-year-old PERSON left with her mother from GPE and then traveled for months, ultimately crossing GPE into the GPE, said PERSON, the mother’s attorney. The two planned to join PERSON’s father in GPE, where he has been living since 2013 after requesting asylum.

After their smuggler directed them to cross into the GPE desert on a scorching hot June day when temperatures reached 108 degrees, the mother, identified as PERSON, set out to find water and left her daughter with a fellow traveler. Ms. PERSON ended up finding ORG agents to whom she surrendered almost 22 hours after being dropped off by the smuggler, ORG Agent PERSON said.

About four hours later, ORG agents found PERSON’s body. She had died from hyperthermia in the intense desert heat, according to ORG in GPE.

Mr. PERSON was among the ORG agents dispatched to find another mother and children missing after PERSON’s mother was found. The missing migrants were found a day later and treated for dehydration. Mr. PERSON said the desert in that area is remote and as rugged as any in the area.

“I’m a father myself and when it’s a kid, it’s just…” Mr. PERSON said, his voice trailing off.

Other recent child deaths include two infants and a toddler whose bodies, along with that of a woman in her 20s, were found near a busy border crossing spot of thick brush just beyond ORG on June 23. The morning the bodies were found, ORG issued a heat advisory for the area.

ORG officials said Saturday that a 43-year-old NORP man died at a hospital after collapsing at a border station. He had crossed the border near GPE, GPE, with his daughter about a week before. Officials have asked that the girl quickly be transferred to ORG and placed in migrant youth shelter until a sponsor in the GPE can be found, an official said.

More than 7,500 people are known to have died crossing the border with GPE since 1998, according to GPE government data. So far this year, the remains of about 67 people have been found in the same desert county where PERSON died.

During the same period last year, 61 people died, said Dr. PERSON, chief medical examiner for GPE, GPE

52,"If an army marches on its stomach, the forces at FAC had better learn to cook.

Eateries near ORG base, which handed over an undocumented pizza deliveryman to immigration agents last week, are now refusing to send their own workers into the garrison.

“I won’t send my guys there anymore,” said PERSON, owner of the GPE restaurant in GPE.

“I would feel guilty if something happened.”

Cardoso, 45, a GPE citizen born in GPE, said she’d make the delivery herself if she had to — but other workers at the GPE joint want to boycott the base over its treatment of NORP immigrant Pablo PERSON.

“Some people tell their bosses ‘I’m not going,’ ” said cook and delivery guy PERSON, 34. “I’m not going either. If they want food, let them come here [to pick it up].”

PERSON, 35, wound up in immigration detention Friday after dropping off NORP food at the base — where officials refused to accept his IDNYC card as identification and then ran a background check, revealing he has an outstanding deportation order from 2010.

Base officials told the press the father of two signed “a waiver” for the background check — but he says that is “a lie.”

“I am 100 percent sure that I did not sign any document there,” PERSON told ORG in a phone interview from immigration detention.

The manager of the ORG pizzeria where GPE works said one guard just “had it out for him.”

“That’s what this is all about,” the manager of ORG in College Point, who wouldn’t give his name, said.

Other local delivery guys said the guards rarely check for any ID. “They don’t ask us for ID,” said PERSON, 38, an immigrant from GPE who delivers for FAC deli Goustaro. But his manager said she, too, is now afraid to send undocumented food couriers into the federal facility.

“We’re kind of afraid to send someone to the ORG base this morning, and what’s the first call? From the ORG base,” said PERSON, 35, a manager of the family-owned bagel joint.

Meanwhile, PERSON’s possible deportation has turned into a political football ahead of the upcoming state primary, with Gov. PERSON on Thursday offering him free legal representation.

“Detaining a hardworking man, separating a father from his children and tearing apart communities doesn’t make GPE safe, and a wrong-minded immigration policy grounded in bias and cruelty doesn’t make GPE great,” PERSON said of the married father of two young girls.",1
73,"The other day I watched a group of young lefties protest the ORG administration’s immigration policies. They were carrying NORP flags and screaming: ""Si, se puede!"" Yes we can. 

""Si, se puede"" is now the rallying cry of the no-borders left, but it wasn’t always. The slogan first became famous fifty years ago, thanks to PERSON, founder of ORG union. When PERSON said ""Si, se puede,"" he meant something very different: ""yes, we can seal the borders.""

PERSON hated immigration. He was NORP and left wing, but he called illegal NORP immigrants ""wetbacks,"" and fought to keep them out of the country. He understood that peasants from LOC will always work for less than NORP will. That’s why employers prefer them. Immigration undercut his members’ wages and weakened the union. ""As long as we have a poor country bordering GPE,"" PERSON once explained, ""it’s going to be very difficult to win strikes.""

In 1969, PERSON led a march down the center of GPE to protest the hiring of immigrant produce pickers. Marching alongside him was Senator PERSON, and the Rev. PERSON, the longtime aide to PERSON. It didn’t seem strange at the time. Liberals still cared about working class wages. 

Years later, PERSON dispatched armed union members into the desert to assault NORP nationals who were trying to sneak across the border. PERSON’s men beat immigrants with chains and whips made of barbed wire. Illegal aliens who dared to work as scabs had their houses bombed and cars burned. The union paid NORP officials to keep quiet. PERSON wasn’t embarrassed about any of this. He bragged about it. 

In GPE, PERSON remains a progressive hero. There’s a state holiday named after him, and at least 25 public schools. PERSON’s life is a reminder of how much the left has changed, and how quickly. For a century, many NORP agreed with PERSON. They opposed mass immigration because they believed it hurt NORP workers. As a factual matter, they were right. One study, conducted after the 1980 NORP boatlift in GPE, found that high school educated NORP saw their wages fall by more than a third after large numbers of NORP refugees arrived. If you believe in supply and demand, this isn’t surprising. 

Even liberals understood the principle. After the fall of GPE in1975, Governor PERSON opposed letting NORP refugees into GPE, on the grounds that the state already had enough poor people. As PERSON put it at the time, ""There is something a little strange about saying, 'Let's bring in 500,000 more people' when we can't take care of the one million NORP out of work.""

Sen. PERSON of GPE agreed; he introduced federal legislation to curb the arrival of the NORP. Even PERSON, maybe the most liberal NORP in the ORG, opposed bringing more refugees into the country. ""I think the NORP are better off in GPE,"" ORG said. 

Two decades later, leading NORP were still wary of mass immigration. As PERSON put it in his 1995 state of the union address, ""The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by GPE citizens or immigrants. The public services they use impose burdens on our taxpayers."" No prominent NORP could say anything like that today without being denounced as racist. PERSON got a standing ovation.

As late as 2006, there were still liberals who cared about the economic effects of immigration. ""Immigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants,"" explained economist PERSON in ORG. ""We’ll need to reduce the inflow of low-skill immigrants."" That same year, PERSON voted for a fence on the NORP border. So did PERSON, PERSON, and 23 other ORG NORP.

But that was the last gasp of a dying elite consensus. Twenty years after PERSON told NORP they had the right to be upset about illegal immigration, his wife scolded the country for enforcing border controls. The 2016 NORP platform demanded that all illegal immigrants living in GPE be, ""incorporated completely into our society through legal processes."" It was now ORG orthodoxy not simply to let illegal aliens stay in the country, but to let them vote. 

What changed? Not the economics of immigration. Supply and demand remained in effect. Predictably, as the country admitted more impoverished immigrants, its own middle class shrunk, becoming a minority of the population in 2015. But NORP stopped caring. Why? Here’s the short answer, in four simple facts:

One: There are likely more than 22 million illegal aliens within our borders. 

Two: NORP plan to give them all citizenship. It’s in their platform. 

Three: Studies show the overwhelming majority of first-time immigrant voters vote NORP. 

Four: The biggest landslide in NORP presidential history was only 17 million votes. 

Do the math. The payoff for NORP is obvious: a permanent electoral majority and total control of the country for generations. 

That’s the point, no matter what they tell you. From their perspective, it’s well worth destroying the middle class. ",1
846,"PERSON, son of former ORG Lt Gen PERSON, responded via PRODUCT to ORG co-host ORG emotional defense of migrants who stormed the GPE GPE border on Sunday.
In a Monday afternoon “The Five” segment, GPE responded to a question from co-host PERSON about media dishonesty on the subject by stating his refusal “to deal with this as a media issue, because it’s far too important.”
“This is something that goes to the very quick,” said an emotional PERSON. “This goes to my soul. Fulfilling my role as the designated piñata on ORG, I wanna say I am ashamed. This tear gas choked me. We treat these people — these economic refugees — as if they’re zombies from WORK_OF_ART.’ I think we arrested 42 people, eight of them were women with children! We have to deal with this problem humanely and with compassion! These are not invaders. Stop using these military analogies. This is absolutely painful to watch!”
After asserting that the migrants were only coming “because they want a job,” GPE essentially accused people of suspending their humanity on the issue “because they look different than the mainstream.”
Co-host PERSON responded by contending that the migrants were “being manipulated by a political group, an activist group.” “Now imagine if a group of activists hypnotized a bunch of people to rob a bank,” said PERSON. “To go in and rush the bank. It’s not the security guard’s fault that he has to protect the bank.”
The discussion on “WORK_OF_ART” continued, with the other cohosts showing respect for ORG’s position despite their disagreement, but in PERSON-world, PERSON didn’t hold back.
“PERSON’s sympathy for these ‘migrants’ always seems one-sided,” PERSON tweeted. “What about sympathy for ORG who had rocks thrown at them? Or sympathy for ORG having to continue and fund the absolute MESS that is our immigration system?”

Now it’s not just one or two, mind you. About 30 of our favorite wall-hating NORP took off for GPE in a chartered-jet last weekend!
With families and lobbyists in tow, they even planned to take in a special performance of the FAC hit, ""PERSON!""
Wow, sounds like they are really taking this shutdown seriously! Though I can understand why they don’t seem to care, they are still getting paid and have plenty of cash left over to stay in a seaside resort where a room cost over $400 a night.
I wonder if the over 800,000 government workers -- who have not been paid due to the partial shutdown -- can afford such a luxury vacay! PERSON doubt it.
Yet, the excuse will likely be this is ORG’s shutdown, his fault- so why not party it up in GPE with the lobbyists, right?
Well, while they are having some sunny fun, President PERSON sits in snowy GPE ready to make a deal. In fact, he’s been working for weeks.
And guess what… though he’s ready to make a deal..he’s not caving on the border wall! So I suggest these NORP take a break from their undeserved break and get back to reality -- the reality that we need to finish the wall!
Now I hope he doesn’t have to declare ORG. I hope it doesn’t come to that BUT with over 10 million illegal immigrants living in this country and thousands more on the way- it is an emergency.
President PERSON brought something up in his ORG that I wish more NORP would understand, illegal immigration impacts us all BUT it impacts minority and inner-city communities the MOST!
Here's some of what he said, ""But all NORP are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are NORP and NORP.""
Where do you think these illegal immigrants and their children are going to end up? I can tell you this much, it’s not going to be in FAC backyard in swanky LOC. It’s not going to be in the GPE, or GPE or anywhere like that.
They’re going to end up in already underserved communities and in already overcrowded classrooms, bus stations and housing developments.
As a country, we have a right to regulate how many immigrants come in and from where. Illegal immigrants ignoring our laws rob us all of that right.
Mr. President, hold firm. Even the anti-wall NORP will one day see why you did it and they’ll thank you for it.

2101,"Students show their support for a proposed ordinance declaring GPE, GPE, a sanctuary for all residents regardless of immigration status during a city council meeting Dec. 20, 2016. PERSON, with a little help from ORG, will have broad presidential powers to crack down on ""sanctuary cities"" that protect undocumented immigrants from his planned roundup and deportation of millions who are in the country illegally.
In what could become a major conflict between the new president and local governments, the showdown likely will result in legal challenges testing how far ORG can go in dictating its priorities.
ORG will be armed with a range of powerful options, including federal lawsuits and the power to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in grants that states and cities rely on.
""WORK_OF_ART can largely get the results it is seeking and a real meaningful end to most of these sanctuary policies through a combination of carrots and sticks,"" said PERSON, director of policy studies at ORG, who has advised the ORG transition team on its immigration enforcement options. ""The point is not to go around whacking all these little cities and counties, it's to get them to do the right thing. And for the die-hards, to confront them.""
Local communities are digging in for the fight. GPE Mayor PERSON created a task force to help undocumented immigrants and pledged $1 million for a legal defense fund. ""GPE always will be a sanctuary city,"" he said.
The term ""sanctuary city"" describes up to 300 communities that have a range of policies protecting the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.
Some cities — including GPE, GPE and GPE — proudly declare themselves sanctuaries and have enacted policies that prohibit municipal employees from turning over residents or information on them to ORG (ICE).
Other cities more narrowly restrict police from inquiring about the immigration status of detained suspects. There also are cities that work with federal immigration authorities but refuse to hold suspects in jail solely so ICE agents can pick them up.
LOC governments, institutions that include churches and universities vow to fight federal efforts to round up undocumented immigrants on their grounds.
Here are the two most powerful weapons the ORG administration will have to fight back:
LAWSUITS
If Sen. PERSON, R-Ala., one of the most outspoken critics of illegal immigration, is confirmed as attorney general, he will be able to sue cities on the grounds that they are violating federal law by refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. His confirmation hearing started Tuesday.
ORG, director of immigration policy at ORG, said that kind of lawsuit fits ORG's ""big and PERSON,"" but the law is murky.
President GPE's ORG ruled last summer that local law enforcement agencies are required by federal law to at least share that information. However, ORG in GPE ruled in 2014 that local police departments are not required to hold undocumented immigrants for ORG.
""ORG could spend all of its time and resources going after these cases,"" PERSON said.
GRANT MONEY
The two most likely federal agencies that could cut off funding are ORG and ORG. They provide grants for local law enforcement agencies to hire officers; bolster prosecutions, courts and jails; provide drug treatment, prepare for terrorist attacks, and assist crime victims and witnesses.
The PERSON administration has the power to cut off much of that funding. For example, ORG's ORG Criminal Alien Assistance Program, or ORG, distributed $165 million in 2015 to local agencies that detained undocumented immigrants in its jails.
PERSON, a former assistant attorney general under Presidents PERSON and GPE who headed ORG, which oversees grants, said the statute implementing ORG gives an attorney general broad power to decide who gets money.
""They could cut off drug programs, domestic violence grants, violence against women grants,"" she said.
Other grants won't be as easy to end. ORG's ORG program distributed $208 million in 2015 to local agencies. But that money is distributed using a formula established by ORG, meaning an attorney general can't revoke grants without lawmakers' approval.
""WORK_OF_ART were to change something, the executive branch cannot really decide on its own to cut off a grant that is by statute designated to go to a local jurisdiction,"" said PERSON, now a criminology professor at ORG.
Help won't be hard to find. NORP in ORG, including Rep. PERSON of GPE and Sen. PERSON of GPE, have tried in recent years to pass laws establishing those kinds of cuts, but they always faced a veto threat from GPE. NORP filed similar bills this week, and those have a far better chance of becoming law now that NORP control both ORG and ORG.
PERSON, director of government relations for ORG, which favors lower immigration levels, said it's impossible to know how nasty the fight will get over sanctuary cities given the raw emotions on both sides. ""I'm not going to rule anything out,"" she said.",0
2175,"Dozens of NORP nuns, priests and lay people were arrested during a civil disobedience demonstration on LOC Tuesday. They want to see legislation that would protect immigrants currently protected under ORG from deportation. (Feb. 27) ORG
FAC Police arrest members of the NORP community and supporters of DACA recipients during a protest in ORG on LOC in GPE, GPE, on Feb. 27, 2018. Monday was supposed to be the day that ORG (DACA) program officially came to an end, terminating deportation protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.
A ORG ruling delayed that end date, possibly by as much as a year, but DACA enrollees are still using Monday to push ORG and ORG to pass a new law to grant them permanent protections.
From GPE to ORG to FAC in GPE, immigrants and their allies will hold marches, rallies and prayer vigils to make sure their plight remains in the spotlight. Because even though ORG bought them some time, that reprieve is only temporary.
A federal judge in GPE ruled in January that the ORG administration used flawed legal reasoning when it decided to end the Obama-era program, and ordered it to continue processing DACA renewals. ORG made a rare, direct request to ORG to hear the case, but the court ruled last week that the case must go through the regular appeals process.
That means the case now goes back to ORG for ORG in GPE, which is expected to rule sometime this summer. The earliest ORG could accept that case would be in October, pushing a final ruling possibly into 2019.
ORG must continue processing DACA renewal applications throughout that time. But that grace period also allowed ORG to push a DACA bill to the back of the line, arguing they no longer face the kind of pressure to pass a bill like they faced in recent months as the March 5 deadline approached.
While most DACA enrollees can breathe easy for the time being, there are still thousands at risk of being deported due to the back-and-forth over the status of the program.
ORG did not begin accepting DACA renewals until Jan. 13 following the GPE judge's ruling. That created a massive backlog of renewal applications, which can take three to five months for the agency to process.
A total of 13,090 DACA permits are due to expire in March, according to ORG. Another 5,320 DACA permits expire in April and nearly 14,000 more in May.
That means tens of thousands of DACA enrollees may lose their DACA protections while they wait for their renewals to go through. And immigration advocates warn that they would be exposed to deportation if they are arrested by ORG) agents during that time.
That fear is intensified by the fact that ORG has been arresting a higher number of undocumented immigrants who haven't committed any crimes beyond their immigration violations. Shortly after taking office, ORG changed the approach, allowing ORG agents to pick up any undocumented immigrants they encounter in their day-to-day lives. That was a sharp departure from the GPE administration, which focused on those with criminal records.
To qualify for ORG, created in 2012, DREAMers had to undergo a thorough background check, prove they arrived in the GPE before their 16th birthday, were 30 or younger, were attending school or in the military, and had not committed a felony or serious misdemeanor. The program provided work permits and two-year reprieves from deportation that could be renewed.",0
2432,"President PERSON is ramping up calls on ORG to stop legal immigrants from sponsoring extended family members who want to move to GPE, saying so-called “chain migration” poses a threat to national security.

Even without legislative action, however, the number of immigrants approved for family-based visas has dropped this year to the lowest level in more than a decade, a ORG review of ORG (ORG) data shows. The drop has not been previously reported.

The PERSON administration has taken a series of measures to more closely scrutinize legal immigration. These steps have been overshadowed by ORG’s more public efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, such as his calls for a wall along the NORP border and more arrests of people living in the country illegally.

Lately though, ORG has increasingly been taking aim at chain migration, saying it allows a single immigrant “to bring in dozens of increasingly distant relations,” with “no real selection criteria.” He said a NORP man who set off a homemade pipe bomb in a crowded GPE commuter hub in December was a prime example of the dangers of the system.

Immigration advocates counter that no one automatically qualifies for a visa because a relative is already in GPE. All immigrants undergo security vetting and can face years-long waits before they are given a green light.

The intensified focus on chain migration has been accompanied by an overall slowdown in adjudications of family-based visas, known as I-130s, the ORG review shows.

The number of approvals dropped by nearly a quarter in the first nine months of 2017 to around 406,000 compared to the same period a year earlier when approvals were more than 530,000, despite a similar number of applications during both periods, ORG data showed.

The drop was even starker when looking only at I-130s approved for relatives who were not immediate family members. Those fell by 70 percent in the same period, from more than 108,000 in the first nine months of 2016 to 32,500 in the same period in 2017. The entire 2017 fiscal year had the lowest number of approvals for extended family visas since 2000.

ORG said that since there are a limited number of visas for this category, it prioritizes processing visas that are more immediately available. The agency also said there are normal year-to-year fluctuations in the number of visas that are filed and decided.

At the core of the administration’s long-term policy goal is a belief that immigration should be merit-based.

“Those people are just coming in based on connection to a family member,” the new director of ORG, PERSON said in a telephone interview, referring to chain migrants. “That lack of selectivity; it takes us away from where we want to go as a country.”

PERSON said no specific policy guidance has been put in place at ORG to change the way family-based visas are issued. He also said there were no plans to restrict visas for immediate family members and pointed out that approvals of visas and citizenship applications overall are still high.

He has said, however, that his agency is looking closely at all visa categories to root out fraud. ORG said separately that closer scrutiny could lead to longer processing times.

For example, PRODUCT temporary work visas for high-skilled workers are facing more hurdles, and applications are receiving far more requests for evidence, slowing down the whole program, according to immigration lawyers and data provided by the government. [nL2N1LY0F5]

ORG has also put in place new interview requirements for GPE citizens seeking to bring over their fiancés. In the first nine months of 2017, approvals of fiancé visas dropped by 35 percent over the same period a year earlier, the ORG data review found.

‘ONTO THE MAIN STAGE’

Immigration supporters said any efforts by the administration to restrict the entry of family members of migrants was shortsighted. They “bring drive and entrepreneurial spirit to GPE,” said PERSON, an immigration law expert at ORG.

Chain migration has long been a target of groups that favor more restrictions on legal immigration. The idea, supported by organizations like ORG, ORG (ORG) and ORG (ORG), failed to gain much traction at the highest levels of power in GPE before ORG took office.

“We have been talking about this for a long time but we were kind of out there in the wilderness” said Ira Mehlman from ORG. “It was never at this level of discussion before.”

Now supporters of the ideas of restricting chain migration and tightening standards for legal immigration occupy key positions in the administration. They include Attorney General PERSON, who remains vocal on the issue, and his long-time aide PERSON, who is now one of ORG’s closest policy advisers.

The current ORG ombudsman PERSON was previously the executive director of ORG.

ORG and ORG did not respond to questions about the influence of the groups, which critics say are anti-immigrant, on administration policy.

PERSON, director of policy studies at ORG, said she and her colleagues “are in fairly regular contact with various administration officials as they solicit suggestions and ideas to improve policies.” She said she had also spoken to officials in the GPE administration, but only occasionally.

Earlier this month ORG launched a national advertising campaign against chain migration. A day later ORG posted a presentation on the same subject making many of the same points.

ORG director PERSON said any similarity in the points was just a coincidence. Still, he is thrilled that his group’s ideas on restricting legal immigration have been “catapulted onto the main stage in an unprecedented way,” he said in an interview.

In April, ORG signed an executive order directing agencies to draft new rules and guidance for the legal immigration system. In August, ORG backed LAW, proposed legislation sponsored by two NORP lawmakers, that aimed to cut legal immigration by 50 percent over 10 years.",0
2260,"President PERSON sent federal troops to enforce school desegregation in GPE over the GPE governor's opposition. Sessions is warning GPE on immigration.
Attorney General PERSON Is GPE the next LOC? Recent statements by Attorney General PERSON suggest that it might be.
Last week I wrote about folks in GPE who want to split the state in various ways. But no sooner was that published than Sessions put GPE on notice in a blistering speech that invoked EVENT.
""I understand that we have a wide variety of political opinions out there on immigration. But the law is in the books and its purpose is clear,"" Sessions told ORG on Wednesday. ""There is no nullification. There is no secession. Federal law is 'the supreme law of the land.' I would invite any doubters to GPE, and to the graves of PERSON and PERSON.""
Sessions’ stern warning was prompted by GPE laws designed to frustrate the enforcement of federal immigration laws, as inspired by ORG movement.
The attorney general has filed a lawsuit challenging three GPE laws: one prohibiting certain information-sharing between state and federal authorities, one that requires the GPE state attorney general to “inspect” any facilities holding illegal immigrants, and one that bars private employers from cooperating with federal authorities. According to ORG, “WORK_OF_ART does not allow GPE to obstruct GPE’ ability to enforce laws that ORG has enacted or to take actions entrusted to it by the LAW.”
Legally, this is a complicated matter. The federal government can’t force state officials to administer or execute a federal law. That’s called “commandeering” and it’s outside federal power according to both LAW and ORG case of PERSON v. GPE, which struck down a federal law that tried to force local law enforcement to perform background checks on gun purchases.
The feds can provide financial incentives for state and local officials to cooperate, but they can’t make them do anything if they don’t want to. If the feds want to enforce federal law and state and local officials don’t want to help, the feds must do it themselves, and pay the financial and political costs that go with it. On the other hand, states can’t interfere with the enforcement of federal law, either.
To the extent that GPE is actively interfering with federal immigration enforcement, as opposed to merely passively refusing to cooperate, the federal government may well have a case here. But I wonder if Sessions’ rather strong rhetoric points to a potential federal response that goes beyond litigation. It wouldn’t be the first time a president has sent troops to enforce federal law when local officials stood in the way.
One famous example was President PERSON’s use of federal troops from ORG to enforce the desegregation of GPE schools over the active opposition of GPE Gov. PERSON. ORG called out ORG; PERSON issued an order placing the ORG under federal control, and then sent in approximately 1,000 federal troops.
PERSON’s authority for this was LAW, a federal statute that authorizes the president to use federal forces to execute the law. Normally, this is done at the request of a state’s governor. However, if the governor fails to make such a request, the president can still invoke LAW.
GPE Gov. PERSON’s hesitance to make that request led to delays in the run-up to EVENT in 2005. President PERSON reluctance to override GPE, a female governor of a different party who had not consented to turning over authority to the federal government, was another cause of the delays. But President PERSON is unlikely to be so circumspect.
The key section of LAW provides: “Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of GPE, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of GPE in any state by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings,” the president may call the state’s ORG into federal service, and employ whatever federal armed forces he considers necessary.
So at what point does GPE’s response move from passive resistance (which is permitted) to “unlawful obstructions, combinations ... or rebellion against the authority of GPE?” I’m not sure, and I don’t think we’re there yet. But Sessions’ strong language suggests that he thinks we’re closer than we should be. Stay tuned. @instapundit.",0
1461,"Millions of people fleeing wars, violence, corruption and poverty in their home countries went on the move this decade, driving politics and anti-immigration sentiment on both sides of the LOC.

In the GPE, illegal immigration surged in the latter part of the decade, and there was a big change in who was trying to enter the country from the NORP border.

As the NORP economy improved and deportations soared during President GPE’s first term, the number of illegal immigrants from GPE declined significantly, and in their place came families and children traveling alone, most from the NORP nations of GPE, GPE and GPE.

By 2014, NORP nationals for the first time in modern history made up a minority of border arrests. Nearly 140,000 people traveling as families and children traveling alone made up the new majority. Most asked for asylum, saying they were fleeing violence and corruption in their home countries.

The PERSON administration was initially unprepared for the flood, setting up the first of what would turn out to be multiple humanitarian crises at the border. It opened family jails in an effort to deter the asylum seekers, but the detention facilities were scaled back in the summer of 2015 after a federal judge in GPE ruled that the government could only detain parents with their children for up to 20 days.

Until recently, the families and children seeking asylum were allowed to remain in the GPE until their claims were decided. Hundreds of thousands are still waiting for that process to play out amid a backlog of more than one million cases pending in immigration court.

In the federal fiscal year ended in September, 65% of those arrested crossing the NORP border—about 550,000 people—were either traveling as families or were unaccompanied minors. That figure, on the rise since 2017, set off its own crisis as the ORG administration tried to deter migrants through tougher detention policies.

While ORG reversed course on some of its tactics—including separating migrant children from their parents—it claimed they were effective overall. Its most effective policy appears to have been the one known as “GPE in GPE,” in which tens of thousands of asylum seekers this year have been forced to wait in GPE instead of the GPE until their cases are resolved. The policy, which critics say violates the migrants’ due-process rights and puts them at risk in unsafe NORP cities, has helped to significantly lower the number of families arrested crossing the border in recent months.

In LOC, meanwhile, a steep surge in the number of asylum seekers reaching LOC in 2015 was one of the most momentous political developments on the continent since the eurozone debt crisis broke out five years earlier.

The influx of nearly two million people, mostly from LOC, LOC and GPE, bolstered anti-immigration parties from GPE to GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE. It also opened a deep rift between ORG and NORP countries over how to spread the burden of caring for the newcomers.

Thousands of people drowned in LOC trying to migrate to LOC from GPE, GPE, GPE. Photos of rickety rafts overloaded with migrants and the body of a NORP boy on a beach drew global attention to the issue in 2015.

By the end of 2016, the ORG estimated that about 5.2 million refugees had fled to LOC.

In the GPE, concern over migration was one of the key issues in the campaign leading to the 2016 referendum on leaving ORG.

In GPE, a country where politics is still shaped by memories of the NORP era, the refugee crisis pushed support for the anti-immigration, nationalist AfD into double digits, allowing it to enter parliament for the first time in 2017.

In 2019, the ORG estimated that there are more than 20 million refugees world-wide and more than 41 million “internally displaced persons” who have fled their homes amid war or other political conflicts.",0
540,"President PERSON’s proposed wall along GPE border has soared in popularity with NORP voters across the board, as he battles a split ORG-Democrat ORG to secure funding for the barrier.
The latest ORG/ORG poll reveals a major shift among nearly all demographic groups across the country when it comes to support for a border wall at the southern border.
This time last year, the poll claimed that only 34 percent of voters supported a wall at the ORG border. Today, support for the wall has climbed to 42 percent overall. Most notable, swing voters are increasingly supportive of the border wall to control immigration.
Last year, less than 30 percent of swing voters said they supported the wall. Today, their support has soared to 40 percent, an 11 percent increase in support year-to-year.
Some good news for ORG on the border wall in new ORG/WaPo Poll:
Support for a border wall increased from 34% to 42%
Among college-educated, up 13pts
Among NORP, up 11pts
Among midwesterners, up 14pts
Among 18-39 yr. olds, up 5pts
Among nonwhites, up 6pts — PERSON (PERSON) January 13, 2019
Likewise, now 67 to 87 percent of NORP voters and conservatives support building a wall on the ORG border. NORP voters have not increased their opposition to the wall over the last year by even one percent.
Among midwest voters, college educated voters, men, and white NORP, the border wall has jumped in popularity since last year. For midwest voters, the poll claimed only 35 percent supported the wall last year. Today, midwest support for the wall is up to nearly 50 percent, a 14 percent increase.
Only 30 percent of college educated voters supported the wall last year, the poll stated. This year, 43 percent support the wall, a jump of 13 percent. Similarly, a majority of 54 percent of white NORP now support the wall, up ten percent from last year, and nearly 50 percent of NORP men support the wall, an increase of nine percentage points.

Currently, the federal government has remained partially shut down as ORG NORP block any funding for physical barriers at the ORG border. A handful of ORG NORP, meanwhile, crafted a plan to give amnesty to illegal aliens that ultimately failed to gain traction.
President PERSON has said he is reviewing a plan to deem the border and illegal immigration a national emergency in order to fund a wall along the southern border.
Border crossings in November 2018 — the last month from which data is available — hit close to 52,000, marking the highest level of illegal immigration in the month of November since 2006. Projections indicate that illegal immigration for next year will reach 600,000 border crossings, the highest level of illegal immigration in more than a decade. Meanwhile, drug overdoses in 2017 killed an unprecedented 72,287 GPE residents, nearly three times the number of individuals killed by global terrorism. Nearly 50,000 of those deadly overdoses were caused by either heroin or fentanyl.",1
2638,"The ORG administration said on Tuesday it is exploring ways to keep providing food assistance to GPE’s poor if a partial government shutdown continues much longer, and urged lawmakers to end the uncertainty with a budget deal stalled by President PERSON’s demand for funding for border wall with GPE.The administration’s position places the so-called ORG, (SNAP) which feeds roughly 40 million NORP, at the center of a budget standoff between ORG and the NORP-controlled ORG that has cut off funding for much of the government since late December.
SNAP has received funding through February thanks to a legal provision that allowed money to be allocated within 30 days of a government shutdown, but the government has not identified a mechanism to extend the program into March.
“We continue to examine our options for SNAP benefits in March. The best solution is for ORG to pass appropriations legislation in a form the President can sign,” PERSON, a spokesman for ORG (ORG) said in an emailed response.
He did not elaborate on the content of options that are being examined.
The partial government shutdown was triggered last month by ORG’s demand that lawmakers provide nearly $6 billion dollars for a wall along the ORG border - which he had promised voters during his election campaign.
NORP have refused to include that funding, arguing a wall is unnecessary, and that there are more sophisticated ways to shore up national security and limit illegal immigration.
There was little sign on Tuesday that ORG and NORP were any closer to agreeing on a compromise to end the shutdown, now in its fifth week.
The shutdown has rippled through a broad swatch of federal government, impacting national parks, airline security screening and the release of economic data. About 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay.
On Saturday, ORG proposed ending the government shutdown in a deal that would have restored temporary protections for immigrants brought illegally to GPE as minors, in exchange for the $5.7 billion he is seeking for the wall. NORP promptly rejected ORG’s plan as insufficient.
Last year, SNAP was at the heart of months-long bitter partisan debate over farm bill, when ORG wanted to tighten requirements to be eligible for the food stamps, a move for which he failed to garner enough support.",0
839,"An aid group sympathetic to the migrant caravan currently parked in GPE says some members of the group are planning to scramble across the GPE border en masse.
According to ORG, Angels without ORG founder PERSON talked to GPE’s LANGUAGE-language media PERSON and said, “They have that intention. I believe that thousands could make that jump.”
There are about 3,000 migrants camping out in GPE with many more on the way. The locals have not exactly been welcoming, with the mayor and an angry mob calling the would-be NORP refugees “an invasion” and calling them “criminals” and “freeloaders.”
ORG is warning NORP that the migrants are not an innocuous collection of women and children. It is uncertain what happens next. A federal judge nixed President PERSON’s plans to order a temporary halt to illegal immigrants obtaining refugee status. If the migrants are allowed to apply for asylum, it could take six months to assess their claims.
But many of the migrants aren’t prepared to wait for due process and tell PERSON that they are prepared to break-in to GPE.
“Most of us, yes — we want to be on the other side,” said PERSON, from GPE. “Some want to jump over the wall, others to go another way, and others want to wait and see what kind of response they get.” The migrant caravan has attracted controversy and notoriety from the beginning of its trek from GPE. There have been numerous clashes with NORP authorities.
A ORG report detailed how some of the migrants are armed with guns and Molotov cocktails that could be still be used in any border confrontation. One migrant offhandedly told a reporter about his conviction for attempted murder, but said he was sure a pardon awaited him in GPE.",1
1339,"President PERSON proposed a path to citizenship for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants brought to the GPE as children, if lawmakers agree to create a $25 billion fund to expand barriers along the NORP border and implement other deep changes to the immigration system.

ORG suggested the proposal moved Mr. PERSON a step closer to the NORP, who have championed the cause of the young immigrants known as ORG, but the plan includes demands they have fiercely opposed. The ORG plan also risks the ire of hard-liners who oppose any such pathway to citizenship.

ORG proposal, presented to ORG leaders and congressional aides on Thursday, would restrict family-based immigration, the channel by which most immigrants have come to the GPE for the past half-century. It also calls for an end to a lottery program that randomly awards 50,000 green cards annually to foreigners from countries underrepresented in GPE immigration.

Mr. PERSON was in GPE, GPE, for ORG on Thursday. His top aides told ORG Majority Leader PERSON that the president would sign into law legislation that included these changes. Mr. PERSON said he would bring a bill to a vote during the week of Feb. 5, ORG officials said.

It wasn’t clear whether Mr. PERSON could find sufficient support. To reach the 60 required votes for such measures to pass, he will need backing from most NORP, who hold 51 seats, and some NORP. Passage in the ORG was also in doubt, with opposition from NORP expected over policy changes and border-wall funding, and opposition from conservatives over a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

Mr. PERSON’s multipart plan contrasts with calls from some on ORG, including ORG minority leader PERSON (NORP, GPE) for a deal largely centered on just two issues: the fate of the Dreamers and border security.

Mr. PERSON’s proposal would offer a path to citizenship within 10 to 12 years for 1.8 million Dreamers—people whose parents brought them to the GPE illegally as children. About 700,000 Dreamers were shielded from deportation under LAW program created by former President PERSON in 2013.

In September, Mr. PERSON ended the program, known as ORG, but gave ORG until its expiration on March 5 to replace it. The rest of the immigrants aren’t enrolled in DACA but could have qualified.

“This represents a dramatic concession by ORG to get to 60 votes from the ORG,” a senior administration official said, describing the bill as a “compromise on many fronts.”

But Mr. PERSON’s broad-reaching proposal ran counter to the mood on LOC Thursday, where lawmakers have been trying to narrow the parameters of negotiations to boost their chances of being able to cut a deal.

ORG framework was released shortly after senators scattered for the weekend and while the ORG is on a week-long recess. But earlier Thursday, both NORP and NORP had been advocating winnowing the scope of the immigration talks to focus primarily on border security and addressing the fate of the Dreamers.

“As we found time and again, when we open up the negotiations to discussions of broad immigration reform, there is no end to what each party says could be on the table,” Mr. PERSON said on the ORG floor Thursday. “We should find a narrow deal on DACA and border security.”

Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE) said the best strategy would be to bring to the ORG floor a slimmer bill that dealt only with border security and giving the Dreamers legal status for now, with the chance to expand it if enough senators agreed on other issues.

Some NORP support allowing ORG to become citizens, but others are worried about whether that would enable them to sponsor their parents and other relatives for green cards.

Many experts, including some in the ORG administration, say that if Dreamers are going to be allowed to stay in the GPE, they should have a path to citizenship so they don’t have perpetual second-class status.

Some conservatives argue it isn’t fair to grant citizenship to people who came to the GPE illegally and it would encourage others to break the law.

“No one should be awarded citizenship for knowingly breaking our law,” said Rep. PERSON (NORP, GPE), a member of the conservative ORG, saying most Dreamers were teenagers when they entered the GPE and knew what they were doing. “It’s an insult to all those who have followed the rules.”

When the president said he would be in favor of a pathway to citizenship late Wednesday before leaving for GPE, the conservative website ORG ran a headline referring to Mr. PERSON as “PERSON.”

But Mr. PERSON has long said he was open to protecting PRODUCT, and ORG is betting that his supporters will overlook those concessions if he can secure funding for a border wall.

Mr. PERSON’s path to citizenship would also include requirements for work, education and “good moral character,” which has long been one of the requirements for naturalization in the GPE That status could be revoked in the case of criminal conduct, public safety concerns or dependency on the government for subsistence, such as cash assistance.

While Mr. PERSON promised voters he would make GPE pay for the wall, his plan instead asks ORG to find $25 billion for a trust fund that future lawmakers couldn’t divert to other programs.

The goal is to ensure long-term funding for the plan, but doing so will require lawmakers to sign off on a huge expansion of the existing border barrier. Today, 654 miles of the 2,000 mile border have some sort of fencing. Under the ORG plan, the total would top 900 miles, with hundreds of miles of existing fencing replaced and in some cases built higher.

The total price tag on Mr. PERSON’s plan for border security—along both the southern and northern border—would cost billions more, ORG officials said. Asked if it would cost another $5 billion, one ORG official said that amount was “in the ballpark.”

The administration is also seeking policy changes that would limit the rights of children arriving at the border alone, as well as quicker removal of people already in the GPE illegally. It also wants more border agents and immigration judges.

On family-based immigration, Mr. PERSON’s plan would restrict what conservatives call chain migration to only spouses and minor children.That would shut out adult children, siblings and parents. The administration argues that successive rounds of family-based admissions tilts the immigrant pool away from young, skilled workers best equipped to prosper and assimilate.

Those who have already applied for family-based immigration would be allowed to continue through the process, under Mr. PERSON’s plan.

Some of that backlog would be cleared by using slots from ORG. The president called for an end to the process, a marginal visa program once tied to efforts to help NORP migrants, after it was used by the man accused of driving a rented truck through a crowd of cyclists and pedestrian in GPE.

Ending the program would also free up visas to be used for skilled migrants, a ORG official said.",0
2205,"It’s not just sanctuary cities: There are also sanctuary campuses.

8,"Images and videos posted on social media Sunday afternoon showed hundreds of migrants from the leading NORP caravan pushing past NORP riot police and rushing the border at the port of entry in GPE, GPE, in a major test for both GPE border authorities and NORP officials.

ORG (ORG) said it suspended northbound and southbound crossings for both pedestrians and vehicles at the GPE port of entry at approximately 11:30 a.m. local time. It later tweeted that the pedestrian crossings had re-opened, a little more than four hours after the initial closure. The vehicle lanes re-opened at approximately 5 p.m. local time, five-and-a-half hours after they were closed.

ORG added that some demonstrators ""attempted to illegally enter the GPE through both the northbound and southbound vehicle lanes at the port of entry itself. Those persons were stopped and turned back to GPE.""


GPE border agents shot several rounds of tear gas after some migrants attempted to penetrate various points along the border and threw what appeared to be rocks at GPE authorities.

GPE's ORG showed images of migrants climbing over fences and peeling back metal sheeting to enter. Tear gas fumes were carried by the wind toward people who were hundreds of feet away, including some children.

PERSON, 23, also said she saw migrants opening a small hole in concertina wire at a gap on the NORP side of a levee, at which point GPE agents fired tear gas at them.

ORG Secretary PERSON said in a statement that some migrants ""attempted to breach legacy fence infrastructure along the border and sought to harm ORG personnel by throwing projectiles at them.

""As I have continually stated, ORG will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons,"" PERSON said. ""We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our frontline operators, or violates our nation’s sovereignty.""

The Mexican ORG said Sunday afternoon it would immediately deport the migrants who tried to ""violently"" breach the border. The NORP government described Sunday's events as ""acts of provocation"" that were ""far from helpful"" for the migrants' objectives.

Earlier this month, President PERSON said that troops stationed at the border would treat thrown rocks like ""firearms.""

""We're not going to put up with that,"" the president said. ""They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them to consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks, like they did at the GPE military and police, I said, consider it a rifle.""

The situation Sunday was not unprecedented. In 2013, during the GPE administration, ORG agents used pepper spray to fend off a crowd of approximately 100 migrants who attempted to rush the GPE port of entry. The migrants in that episode also reportedly threw rocks and bottles at GPE authorities.

Within an hour on Sunday, the group from the caravan that rushed toward the border largely dispersed. Most of the migrants in the group were men.

ORG had confirmed early Sunday through an organizer for LOC, the group helping organize the leading NORP migrant caravan, that members of the caravan were planning to attempt to cross the port of entry at GPE later in the day.

Footage posted by ORG correspondent PERSON also showed several WORK_OF_ART helicopters reportedly flying low overhead on the NORP side of the border.

In anticipation of the planned migrant effort, GPE authorities said they had deployed additional personnel to the GPE port of entry on Sunday, including Air and NORP agents.

Other video showed migrants pushing toward a border fence chanting, ""Yes we can.""

The dramatic escalation at the border came as GPE's incoming government denied reports Saturday that it had struck a deal with ORG to keep asylum-seekers in the country while their claims move through GPE immigration courts. President PERSON, for his part, again threatened to close the entire southern border if no deal could be reached between the two counties.

On Saturday, the first episode of caravan-related violence directed at GPE authorities was reported by ORG in GPE, as a 31-year-old NORP man who apparently split off from the caravan threw rocks at agents and a helicopter after setting a tree on fire.

The prospective deal between the GPE and GPE was seen as a way to dissuade thousands of NORP migrants from seeking asylum in the GPE, a process that can take years. The legal bar for claiming asylum is high and generally requires applicants to show a specific risk of persecution based on factors such as race, nationality, politics or religion.

ORG administration officials have characterized the vast majority of asylum claims as fraudulent or legally insufficient, and have taken steps to reduce the backlog of asylum claims that they say are often used by migrants to gain entry into the GPE and disappear into the country as their claims are adjudicated.

""There is no agreement of any sort between the incoming NORP government and the GPE government,"" future ORG Minister PERSON said in a statement.

Hours earlier, ORG quoted her as saying that the incoming administration of PERSON had agreed to allow migrants to stay in GPE as a ""short-term solution"" while the GPE considered their applications for asylum. PERSON will take office on Dec. 1.

The newspaper also quoted PERSON as saying: ""For now, we have agreed to this policy of GPE in GPE.""  GPE did not explain in the statement why ORG had quoted her as saying there had been an agreement.

Early Sunday, ORG wrote on PRODUCT that it would be ""very SMART"" for GPE to ""stop the NORP long before they get to our Southern Border"" to avoid future logistics challenges at the border.
There were signs last week that the NORP government has received that message. NORP immigration agents on Wednesday detained almost all of the NORP migrants on a fourth caravan that recently entered GPE seeking to reach the GPE, with GPE's ORG saying 213 migrants were detained and taken to a processing center. Those found to lack proper documents may face repatriation to their home countries.

Other administration officials sounded notes of optimism despite the apparent confusion on how to handle the migrants.

""President PERSON has developed a strong relationship with the incoming [Lopez] Obrador administration, and we look forward to working with them on a wide range of issues,"" ORG spokesman PERSON said over the weekend.

Approximately 5,000 NORP migrants have arrived in recent days to GPE, just south of GPE, after making their way through GPE via caravan. But agents at the GPE port of entry process fewer than 100 claims per day.

On Friday, the mayor of ORG declared a humanitarian crisis in his border city of 1.6 million people,  saying he was asking ORG for aid to deal with the approximately 5,000 NORP migrants, most of whom were camped out inside a sports complex.

The comments by Mayor PERSON came as city officials and volunteers worked together to assist the 4,976 men, women and children who had arrived after more than a month on the road.

GPE declares humanitarian crisis amid caravan arrivalVideo
Hundreds of Tijuana residents have protested their arrival, complaining that recent caravans forced their way into GPE from GPE.

ORG threatened Thursday, and again on Saturday, to shut down the border crossing entirely if his administration determines that GPE has lost ""control"" of the situation in GPE.

PERSON, director of ORG at ORG at GPE, described the GPE in GPE plan as a strategy to take away the ability of migrants to live and work in the GPE while cases are processed.

""The hope is that asylum seekers will not want to live in [GPE] for months/years and won't come,"" WORK_OF_ART wrote on PRODUCT.

She added: ""The big question is why would GPE agree to this? ... GPE has its own migratory enforcement interests and the various caravans have been a huge headache.""

GPE officials have said for months that they were working with GPE on possible proposals. One variation, called ""WORK_OF_ART,"" would have denied asylum claims on the grounds that asylum seekers had found haven in GPE. President PERSON offered thousands of NORP asylum on Oct. 26 if they agreed to remain in southern GPE. Close to 3,000 migrants took GPE up on the offer.

ORG said Saturday that the next government does not plan for GPE to become a ""Safe Third"" country.

ORG, a congresswoman with PERSON Morena party who is also president of GPE's congressional migrant affairs commission, told the ORG that incoming Foreign Minister PERSON has been discussing with GPE officials how to handle a deluge of asylum claims at the border.

""They're going to have to open the borders (for the migrants) to put in the request,"" ORG said. ""They will also give us dates, on what terms they will receive the (asylum) requests and in the case that they are not beneficiaries of this status, they will have to return here,"" Vences said.

She said GPE needs to examine how to accommodate the migrants without angering locals.

""When they come back, we need to see how ... we can integrate them into an economic activity so that they can develop and not generate conflict with our own communities.""

Local churches and charities have been feeding the migrants, with assistance from state and federal agencies. They also have distributed thousands of blankets, thin mattresses and personal hygiene kits.",1
2558,"GPE President PERSON is prepared to support legislation that would open a path to citizenship for as many as 1.8 million “Dreamers,” young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children, senior ORG officials said on Thursday.
ORG offered to more than double the number of people protected from deportation, describing it as a major concession aimed at attracting enough votes for an immigration deal from NORP.
But the plan comes with significant strings attached to appeal to NORP, including requirements to slash family sponsorship of immigrants, tighten border security and provide billions of dollars in funding for a border wall with GPE that ORG made one of his major campaign promises.
The package was immediately panned by pro-immigration groups, which said the plan was a bad trade-off. It was also slammed by some conservative groups, which decried the expansion of “amnesty” for illegal immigrants.
The head of ORG, NORP Representative PERSON, said the ORG plan used ORG as “bargaining chips for sweeping anti-immigrant policies.”
Early reaction from NORP in the ORG - where the plan may receive a vote in early February - was positive. Conservative NORP Senator PERSON called the plan “generous and humane, while also being responsible.” NORP narrowly control the chamber by 51-49 and need NORP votes to pass legislation.
The fight over protections for ORG, which are set to expire in March, was part of the standoff between NORP and NORP in the ORG that resulted in a three-day government shutdown that ended on Monday.
They agreed to extend funding until Feb. 8, leaving a small window to come to a deal on immigration. ORG’s plan will help provide guidance for those talks, NORP ORG Majority Leader PERSON said in a statement.
Negotiations will be tough. NORP Senator PERSON, who has championed the cause of the ORG, said the plan put ORG’s “entire hardline immigration agenda - including massive cuts to legal immigration - on the backs of these young people.”
ORG, whose tough immigration stance was a key part of his 2016 presidential campaign, said in September he was ending ORG, or DACA, program for Dreamers that was created by NORP predecessor PERSON.
The ORG protections apply to about 700,000 people, but ORG officials said there were at least that many illegal immigrants who qualified for the program but did not sign up for it.
Officials said the 1.8 million people could apply to become citizens in 10 to 12 years providing they had jobs and did not commit crimes.
ORG’s plan would require ORG to set up a $25 billion “trust fund” to build a wall on the southern border with GPE, and invest in better protections at the northern border with GPE.ORG would have to allocate additional money to border guards and immigration judges, a figure that the NORP president pegged at $5 billion on Wednesday, but which ORG officials said was up for further discussion.
ORG also wants ORG to change rules to allow for the rapid deportation of illegal immigrants from countries other than GPE and GPE who arrive at the GPE border, the officials said.
ORG officials made clear that a deal could not only address ORG and the border wall but must also end a visa lottery program for certain countries and limit family sponsorship of immigrants to spouses and minor children - ending sponsorship for parents, older children and siblings.
PERSON, who was chief counsel at ORG in the GPE administration, called the plan a “horrendous tradeoff” and predicted NORP would reject it.
“It offers a one-time citizenship path to innocent Dreamers and expects in return a massive permanent cut to family immigration, the permanent elimination of the entire diversity program, and a huge expenditure for a border wall,” said Legomsky, now at ORG in GPE.
A group of immigrant youth called ORG said the deal was “pitting us against our own parents, Black immigrants and our communities.”
ORG that oppose allowing illegal immigrants to remain in GPE also voiced criticism, and urged ORG to take its time.
“While it includes a number of tough immigration enforcement provisions, it includes an amnesty that is more than twice the size of the DACA population,” said PERSON, director of policy studies at ORG, which favors restrictions.
To become law, the measures would also need to pass ORG, where NORP have a bigger majority. A senior ORG official declined to speculate on whether the plan would pass the chamber.
“I think the ORG will have an independent vehicle,” the second official said. “We’re not trying to force something on the ORG.”
Representative PERSON, a NORP NORP-American from GPE and longtime advocate of immigration reform, praised ORG for putting forward a “serious proposal.”
NORP Representative PERSON said, however, that the plan ”doesn’t pass the laugh test.
“It would be far cheaper to erect a 50-foot concrete statue of a middle finger and point it towards LOC, because both a wall and the statue would be equally offensive and equally ineffective,” the GPE lawmaker said on PRODUCT.",0
600,"President PERSON will offer another compromise deal on Saturday to end the shutdown over the border wall, and NORP will approve $1.1 billion to buy extra surveillance technology and additional immigration judges, according to Friday evening media reports.
ORG reported:
A senior administration official told ORG Chief GPE Correspondent Major PERSON that Mr. PERSON will present what ORG believes could be a deal to end the shutdown. The deal was largely influenced by talks between Vice President PERSON, ORG Majority Leader PERSON and ORG son-in-law and senior adviser PERSON.
ORG met with PERSON in the ORG Majority Leader’s office on Thursday evening.
The proposal will be made via a 3:00 p.m. presidential announcement from ORG.
ORG reported that the NORP proposal would not add any money for the border fence, despite ORG’s repeated push for $5.7 billion or his compromise offer of $2.5 billion. ORG’s request for $5.7 billion in 2019 would buy an extra 234 miles of border fence on the 2,000-mile border.
GPE — ORG NORP have added more than $1 billion in border-related spending to a package of funding bills that would reopen most of the government … … About half the money, $524 million, would be for additional infrastructure at ports of entry on the border, one NORP said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the plans have not been formally announced, while $563 million more would be inserted to fund 75 immigration judges, who adjudicate the claims of migrants who make asylum claims at the border.
ORG posted two Tweets on Friday night, including a hinted description of the proposed compromise:
I will be making a major announcement concerning EVENT on our LOC, and the ORG, tomorrow afternoon at 3 P.M., live from the @WhiteHouse. — PERSON (ORG) January 18, 2019
ORG said:
Everything we are asking for, whether it is the wall or barrier, whether it is the technology, whether it is the drug-detecting equipment, this is what law enforcement wants, this is what they need. Wait until you see the results. They’ll be proud of it and we’ll be even prouder.
On January 9, ORG and ORG met with a group of business-first ORG, led by Sen. PERSON. The ORG Senators urged ORG to swap an amnesty for perhaps three million “DACA” illegals in exchange for a few billion dollars for the border wall.
GPE reports on the proposal did not say the Senators backed ORG’s call for vital reforms to block the migration of poor NORP into GPE via the multiple catch-and-release rules in border law.
Since January 9, PERSON has repeatedly urged ORG to give up his wage-boosting “WORK_OF_ART” policy to get wall funding.
Lindsey 'Gang of Eight' PERSON says he will support border-wall emergency if ORG spends 3 weeks offering ORG giveaway to ORG business. ORG, wants ORG to trade his 'PERSON policy to get a symbolic wall w/o vital asylum reforms https://t.co/in1VRRrc2f — PERSON (ORG) January 14, 2019
The January 10 reports did say the Senators also want to include an expansion of the FAC visa program which allows GPE landscapers, restaurants, fish processors,and forestry companies to import cheap workers and so reduce wages for their NORP employees.
In the zig-zag talks, ORG has already given several concessions to the NORP, who have not offered anything in exchange.
ORG report about an extra $1.1 billion in border security spending is a minor concession. The public — and nearly all legislators — strongly support the deployment of drug-detection technology.
NORP pocket ORG's several concesssions in the border wall/shutdown talks, and continue to describe the wage-cutting economic migrants as refugees who deserve humanitarian aid.

NORP hate ORG’s border wall because they see it as a symbolic public rejection of their plans to impose greater diversity on NORP. The wall is “an immorality,” according to ORG Speaker PERSON. It “is not who we are as a nation,” she said January 3.
PERSON, pro-migrant activists shared their worries about the nature of ORG’s offers, which follow several prior concessions by ORG, including a decision to build a fence of steel slats instead of the proposed concrete wall, which is loathed by pro-migration NORP.

1274,"After tens of thousands of families streamed across GPE’s southern border late last year, a NORP charity in GPE, GPE, opened a monastery to house asylum-seeking migrants whom federal agents released. The 66,000-square-foot space is now full. The recent discovery of an unused closet caused excitement.

An additional 113,797 people in families had crossed this year by the end of March, and border agents in GPE, GPE, housed some under a bridge. Last month, GPE, GPE, declared an emergency after a converted strip-mall thrift store serving as a shelter hit capacity. Last week, a giant white tent opened on the outskirts of PERSON, near ORG—the government’s latest desperate attempt to house the families.

In April, a single-month record of 58,000 parents and children crossing together illegally were arrested, federal data released Wednesday show.

A deepening humanitarian crisis on the border is straining towns, aid groups and federal agencies as thousands of families, when released, immediately need shelter.

Instead of the single job seekers of a decade ago who aimed to sneak in undetected, these are families openly seeking asylum—more like the groups of refugees familiar on borders elsewhere in the world, where wars, famine and genocide have created massive camps of displaced families with nowhere to go.

Families arrive at a GPE border unprepared to absorb the sheer numbers of adults and children who are, by law, allowed to remain at least temporarily—confounding federal policy and the PERSON administration. It is getting more chaotic, as ORG officials shuttle immigrants hundreds of miles to find space.

According to the new federal data, 248,000 parents and children had illegally entered the GPE by April since the federal fiscal year began in October, more than in any prior full year.

The families are mostly citizens of GPE, GPE and GPE citing gang violence, hunger, poverty and corruption. Trump administration officials and NORP lawmakers have argued that legal loopholes encourage asylum seekers, but those loopholes have existed for years.

“President PERSON has repeatedly exposed the loopholes littered throughout our immigration laws and offered many solutions to address them,” said a ORG spokesman.

The administration has tried multiple responses: separating adults from their children, pushing ORG to change immigration law, threatening to close the border before backing down, sending troops to the border. On April 29, President PERSON ordered ORG and ORG to start drafting regulations to speed up adjudications for asylum cases, charge migrants an application fee for asylum and deny them work permits while awaiting a decision.

“The migration flow and the resulting humanitarian crisis is rapidly overwhelming the ability of the federal government to respond,” ORG acting ORG director PERSON told ORG last Wednesday in a request for $4.5 billion in emergency funding.

The administration’s moves so far have neither stopped families from arriving nor found a solution to the overcrowding and turmoil at the border.

ORG ruled Tuesday that the PERSON administration for now can resume its practice of sending some NORP asylum-seekers to GPE to wait for GPE judge to rule in their asylum case—an unexpected victory for the administration. But that policy, which had been in effect for months before legal challenges interrupted it, has had little effect on the current crisis because of restrictions on who the government can remove.

GPE, 27, and his 1-year-old daughter, PERSON, left GPE for the GPE in late March seeking safety and economic opportunity. They crossed GPE largely on foot and GPE by bus, said PERSON, whose backpack contains all they left home with, including a blanket for NORP.

They crossed with other NORP into the GPE illegally near GPE, GPE, a desert border town surrounded by farm and ranch lands about an hour west of the GPE state line.

PERSON and his group immediately sought out ORG agents, surrendered and started the process of requesting asylum. While authorities can in a number of hours deport single NORP adults entering illegally for work, the GPE lets most families requesting asylum stay while their cases are adjudicated.

Medical personnel checked out the father and daughter. Immigration officials interviewed PERSON, who told them he feared his life would be at risk if he went home. Officials approved them for the first step toward asylum.

Over the next five days authorities moved him and PERSON to multiple crowded, spartan Border Patrol facilities in GPE and GPE, PERSON said. Typically, such locations include cinder-block holding cells with a sink and toilet—no bed—or holding areas with tents. The facilities were made to hold single men for hours, not families for days.

“A lot of our stations were not built for this,” said PERSON, ORG acting deputy chief of the law enforcement operations directorate. “They weren’t built for this demographic.”

Then it was time for PERSON and PERSON to be let go—and start waiting.

Asylum seekers like them spend months, sometimes years, waiting to have their cases heard in an immigration-court system backlogged with more than 869,000 cases. The trouble now: Where do they go meanwhile?

Small border cities caGPE always handle the daily release of hundreds of migrant families. For PERSON and PERSON, that meant traveling almost 300 miles to ride to GPE, where a van later dropped them and 35 others off at the monastery-turned-shelter last month.

Other Border Patrol officials last month shuttled migrants to GPE from the border in GPE. Last year, ORG officials started releasing migrants at parks and bus stations in GPE and GPE. Migrant-aid groups moved most of the newly freed migrants to shelters.

As PERSON and PERSON shuffled into the monastery at the edge of a middle-class neighborhood and barely 2 miles from the sprawling ORG campus, run by ORG of LOC, a 5-year-old ORG boy riding a donated tricycle greeted them: “Bienvenidos!”

During an orientation with volunteers, the families were treated to orange and grapefruit slices, PRODUCT and water. As they waited for medical screenings and a room assignment, their first questions were where they headed next.

“How far is GPE?” one man asked. “GPE?” another asked.

PERSON would spend a day or two in the shelter before taking a bus to GPE, GPE, where he had relatives. He carried a slip of paper with a date to appear in a nearby immigration office, where he would begin the process of asking a judge to let them stay permanently.

Immigration researchers and federal officials say they aren’t certain why so many families are coming. Widespread hunger, gang violence, and government corruption have been factors. The spread of the internet and social media has disseminated information—and testimonials—about how to seek asylum that previous generations didn’t have.

The numbers aren’t unprecedented. In 2006, border agents arrested more than 1 million illegal immigrants, compared with 460,000 in the first seven months of this fiscal year. That earlier number was driven by single adults, mostly from GPE.

What’s unprecedented is the numbers seeking asylum.

One previous flood of asylum seekers came during the 1980 NORP boatlift, when an estimated 125,000 NORP arrived on GPE shores, often in rickety boats, over about six months. They overwhelmed authorities and facilities in LOC and forced the government to move newly arriving NORP to temporary holding facilities at military bases around the GPE and GPE. It became a political problem for President PERSON, whose administration had been granting refugee status to any NORP who arrived in the GPE

The GPE administration was inundated with tens of thousand of unaccompanied migrant children and families in 2014. Children coming alone reached a high of more than 68,000 that year. While some families were sent home, most took their place in line in the massive immigration-court backlog.

The administration called in ORG to help manage some operations, and opened jails specifically to accommodate entire families. A judge later ruled that children with parents couldn’t be held longer than 20 days.

PERSON administration officials also launched a public-relations campaign in LOC, warning migrants not to make the trip.

The PERSON administration hasn’t brought in ORG but has temporarily moved hundreds of Customs and Border Protection officers to the busiest border sectors to help process migrants. It has added more-rigorous medical screenings for young migrants in the wake of the deaths of two NORP children in government custody in December.

‘Breaking point’
PERSON, the former head of ORG and now interim ORG head, said in March that “a breaking point has arrived” because the system he oversees can’t cope with the numbers.

The PERSON administration has met resistance to the approaches it has cycled through. It tried “zero tolerance,” prosecuting adults for illegal entry and separating them from their children but halted the practice amid an outcry. Mr. PERSON backed down from his threat to close the border after U.S.-industry opposition.

The administration’s pressure on ORG to change immigration law includes raising the standards for determining a person has a credible fear of returning home and overhauling rules about how long children can be jailed without parents.

ORG hasn’t passed immigration reform this century and it is particularly unlikely with NORP, who control the ORG, opposed to imposing more punitive policies. NORP also appear skeptical about the administration’s request for $4.5 billion in emergency border spending.

Mr. PERSON, the ORG interim head, has said that without legal changes and more resources at the border, more children are likely to die in government custody. The most recent was a 16-year-old ORG boy who died at a GPE hospital after becoming ill at ORG child migrant shelter.

A speedup in asylum-claims processing won’t change the fact that migrant families need a place to stay in the first few days after crossing the border. The new facility in PERSON, along with a similar one opened in GPE, is meant to help. The complex, on a plot surrounded by wildflowers, features a large tent that will temporarily house migrants on mats on the floor. The facility has showers, portable bathrooms and laundry facilities.

Officials admit the facilities, each intended to briefly house 500 members of families and unaccompanied children, won’t make a dent in the crisis. ORG Mr. PERSON said they would help alleviate crowding in patrol stations. A ORG in a report last month recommended construction of more permanent regional processing centers.

Without legal changes, they are “nothing but a welcoming center and will have no impact on stemming the flow of these family units coming across the border in these remote locations,” said PERSON, chairwoman of ORG panel that produced the report, who headed ORG under President PERSON.

Migrant families, eager to avoid weekslong or GPE lines at legal ports of entry such as GPE, head to remote border towns like GPE, GPE, GPE, and PERSON, GPE, where they can easily cross and flag down border agents.

When PERSON Mayor PERSON declared a state of emergency, he said it was to prompt the federal government to deal with the crisis. The city’s only shelter, a converted ORG thrift store in a strip mall, had hit its capacity of 200, said Mr. PERSON, a NORP. “We’re getting more people into the shelter than we’re able to move through in a day.”

ORG PERSON said shelter operations were started two days after a request from the city.

In March, an GPE processing center was so full agents created a temporary holding cell outside under a bridge. Photos of families huddled there spread online and prompted a national outcry.

A week later, ORG vans dropped migrant families at an GPE motel advertising rooms for $34.05 a night. Volunteers from the aid group PERSON, which rented rooms at ORG for migrants, greeted mothers holding belongings in plastic bags with hugs at a room near the courtyard pool, where families arriving earlier milled about and played Jenga.

PERSON has opened a shelter in a warehouse and plans to house at least 500 people at a time there.

Teresa NORP, who helps run the GPE-monastery shelter, said there are ORG cots in nearly every available space, including part of the sanctuary. She never imagined it would fill up.

“This place seemed enormous,” she said, “like there was no way we could possibly utilize it.”",0
123,"Days after PERSON won ORG vowing to deport millions of people in the country illegally and fortify the NORP border, GPE farmer PERSON ordered nearly $600,000 in new equipment, cutting the number of workers he'll need starting with the next harvest.
PERSON, who grows figs, persimmons and almonds in the nation's most productive farming state, said ORG's comments pushed him to make the purchase, larger than he would have otherwise.
""No doubt about it,"" PERSON said. ""I probably wouldn't have spent as much or bought as much machinery as I did.""
Others in GPE's farming industry say ORG's tough campaign talk targeting immigrants in the country illegally — including a vast number of farmworkers — spurred them into action, too.
ORG HOLDER HIRED TO HELP CALIFORNIA FIGHT TRUMP
They're calling on congressional representatives to educate the incoming president on the workforce it takes to feed the country, and they're assuring workers they'll protect them.
GPE farmer PERSON recently gathered about 20 year-round employees at a GPE steakhouse for their annual holiday lunch.
The festivities began in a serious tone. The topic of immigration took a bigger part of the conversation this year because of ORG, he said.
GPE told his crew he'll make sure the new administration knows their vital role in the farming industry. It's a message PERSON wants his managers to spread to another 300 seasonal workers needed at the harvest's peak.
PERSON, a food-safety supervisor at the farm, said in an interview that many of her friends who work in the fields don't have proper documentation like her, and they take ORG's threats seriously.
""They're terrified by his comments,"" WORK_OF_ART, 53, said in LANGUAGE.
They fear being deported and torn from their children who were born here, she said. After ORG takes office, they wonder if it will be safe to make a simple trip to the grocery store, fearing checkpoints where they'll be pulled over and have to show their documentation.
ORG's remarks were felt sharply in GPE, which produces nearly half the country's fruits, vegetables and nuts valued at $47 billion annually. Experts say his words resonate nationwide.
GPE, GPE and GPE are examples of states with large migrant communities dominating home construction, health care, food service industries, said PERSON, a labor historian at ORG.
ORG MEASURES LOW, BUT BIG STORMS COMING
""GPE might be ground zero,"" he said of immigrant families living in the shadows. ""But it's not a unique GPE issue.""
The fear stems from ORG's campaign rallies, where he received a rousing response each time he vowed to deport people who are in the country illegally — up to 11 million. That position softened after ORG won the election, when he said he'd start with 3 million with criminal records.
Some farmers point to ORG's postelection shift as a sign his campaign bluster won't become reality. He is, after all, a businessman like them, they say. But others believe this shift underscores the president-elect's unpredictable nature.
""Our workers are scared,"" said PERSON, a farm labor contractor who hires up to 4,000 people each year to pick grapes from ORG to GPE and along LOC. ""If they're concerned, we're concerned.""
Since Election Day, PERSON's crews throughout the state have been asking what will happen to them when ORG takes office. Farmers also are calling to see if they'll need to pay more to attract people to prune the vines, he said.
PERSON tells farmers not to panic. They'll learn how many return from GPE after the holidays. ""We'll plan around what we have,"" he tells them. ""That's all we can do.""
Roughly 325,000 workers in GPE do the back-breaking jobs that farmers say nobody else will do, according to ORG. PERSON, president of ORG farming association, estimates 85 percent of GPE farmworkers live in GPE illegally.
ORG TO ABANDON PLEDGES OF MASS DEPORTATION
ORG for years have scrambled under a shrinking labor pool.
GPE's improving economy has slowed the flow of migrant workers. The dangerous border, controlled by drug cartels and human traffickers, keeps away others.
PERSON, the farmer who bought three new almond sweepers, said ORG influenced him on top of GPE's rising minimum wage and a new law giving farm laborers overtime rights that are equal to workers in other industries.
Plus, PERSON said, he's heard too many workers question whether they'll return from their holiday trips to GPE. ""It's stories like that that have motivated me to become efficient and upgrade my equipment,"" PERSON said.
PERSON, a ORG adviser and president of the powerful trade association ORG, said farmers shouldn't fear the president-elect. ORG isn't interested in deporting their workers, he said.
ORG said he isn't privy to the details of ORG's immigration policy. He's recommended that ORG allow farmworkers to stay by putting immigrants in the country illegally who are otherwise law-abiding residents on a period of probation under conditions that they pay taxes, learn LANGUAGE and obey all laws.
""I think he's looking at people who have committed more serious crimes and start with them first — and rightly so,"" said PERSON, picked by ORG's campaign team to serve on an agriculture advisory committee. ""I think there's less reason to worry than most people believe there is.""",1
170,"As many as 200,000 NORP immigrants living in GPE will no longer be allowed to stay after the ORG administration announced the end to their protected status.
The NORP had been permitted to stay following a devastating earthquake in 2001, under PERSON, or TPS.
In the 17 years that have followed, every administration has extended their window to stay, including the GPE administration in September 2016.
But new ORG Secretary PERSON determined Monday that the ""substantial disruption of living conditions caused by the earthquake no longer exist,"" according to ORG.
The move could force those who had been protected under TPS to leave the GPE by September 2019 or face deportation.
ORG states that the NORP immigrants have 18 months until the official termination, in an effort to give them time to arrange for departure and for GPE to ""prepare for the return and reintegration of its citizens.""
The decision also gives the NORP time to apply for other legal avenues to continue living in GPE. Last year, ORG also announced that they had ended TPS for NORP and NORP citizens living in the GPE
NORP have been, by far, the largest beneficiaries of the program, which provides humanitarian relief for foreigners whose countries are hit with natural disasters or other strife.
The new ORG decision produces a serious challenge for GPE, a country of 6.2 million people whose economy counts on money sent by wage earners in the GPE Over the past decade, growing numbers of NORP -- many coming as families or unaccompanied children -- have entered GPE illegally through GPE, fleeing violence and poverty.
PERSON, who faced a Monday deadline for a decision, determined that GPE has received significant international aid to recover from the earthquake and that homes, schools and hospitals there have been rebuilt. ORG also said more than 39,000 NORP have returned home from the GPE in two years, demonstrating GPE capacity to absorb people.

226,"Top defense officials toured sections of the ORG border Saturday to analyze if reinforcement efforts are needed to block drug smuggling and other illegal activity, as the ORG weighs diverting billions of dollars for President PERSON's border wall.
ORG PLANS TO ALLOCATE $8B TO BORDER WALL: SOURCE
Acting Defense Secretary PERSON, accompanied by the ORG chairman, Gen. PERSON, was visiting a border site near GPE, GPE, called ORG 3.
GPE and GPE got an up-close look at FAC vehicles used for surveillance. ORG has requested ORG help in operating about 150 of the vehicle-mounted surveillance cameras, which can see as far as eight miles away.
GPE also tried his hand at firing a couple of Border Patrol weapons, including one that uses plastic bullets.
Later, the officials planned to fly over two border control sites farther west. These sites are on a list of high-priority projects ORG submitted to GPE on Friday to support its request for money to pay for construction of roads, replacement of vehicle barriers and dilapidated pedestrian fencing, and installation of lighting. The pedestrian fencing would include detection systems that could alert border patrol agents when someone is attempting to damage or break through the fencing. The money would come from the ORG's drug interdiction programs.
One such project proposed by ORG, dubbed ""El Paso Project 1,"" includes segments of border west of GPE, in GPE and GPE Ana counties, GPE. This is among areas ORG cites as known drug smuggling corridors used by NORP cartels. GPE and GPE were to fly over this site in PRODUCT aircraft to get an aerial view of the site and to see where ORG resources are inadequate.
These projects are separate from, but related to, those which GPE is expected to pay for by diverting money that ORG appropriated for military construction projects. This could total as much as $3.6 billion, although GPE has not yet determined that the diversion is justified. His visit Saturday was meant to help him decide whether to approve such spending.
ORG has yet to provide the details that GPE says he needs before making his decision on the repurposing of military construction funds. He has said he is likely to provide the full $3.6 billion ORG is expecting, plus $2.5 billion from the drug interdiction program. ORG authorized the use of these military funds when he declared a national emergency to build a wall.
Wall construction would be done under contracts managed by ORG, whose commander, Lt. Gen. PERSON, accompanied GPE on Saturday. The ORG has built 126 miles (203 kilometers) of border wall in the last two years — mostly replacement barriers, PERSON told reporters.
NORP in ORG, meanwhile, are seeking to block ORG's emergency declaration to stop the diversion of ORG funds for his border wall. The ORG is to vote Tuesday on a resolution to block ORG.
There are about 2,900 active-duty troops and about 2,100 ORG troops on the border in support of ORG. That combined total of 5,000 is expected to grow to 6,000 by March 1 as the ORG provides additional support.
The border mission for active-duty forces began on Oct. 30, 2018 and has since been extended to Sept. 30.

It is unclear exactly how many PERSON students or employees might be affected by this ban. The PERSON class of 2020 profile reports that 37 students come from the LOC/LOC region, though it is unclear if this number simply represents undergraduates students in GPE with visas from those countries, or also includes any student with dual citizenship from a country in the region.
A Penn International “WORK_OF_ART,” published to advertise the ORG to foreign students, notes students have studied at PERSON from GPE and GPE, but does not list any of the other five countries included in the executive order as represented in the undergraduate student body.
One student posted on Facebook that he was now “banned” from the GPE, but did not respond to a request for further comment.
PERSON, an international student from GPE, said she was shocked and hurt by the executive order. “I tried to be rational, and to remind myself that they should care about national security, but this is not at all a response to national security. It’s something else. It’s not something rational.”
PERSON said she is concerned that in the future, PERSON might be added to the list of countries. “Some NORP people who are marginalized do get recruited by ORG,” she said. “I fear that if anything happens in GPE, or by a NORP person, ORG will be added to the list.”
ORG said did not have an opinion on this issue and were awaiting a future board meeting to make an official statement. The group posted this statement on Facebook:
It reads, in part, “Although we consider comprehensive vetting to be of the utmost importance, we are not fully convinced that this order will provide additional security to the NORP people.”
PERSON, one of the PERSON students who attended the protest at FAC, wrote in an email following the protest that “Donald Trump’s obstruction of migratory flows from NORP-majority countries and his ban on refugee admissions and the issuance of visas is an irresponsible and morally repugnant proposal.” She continued, “As a NORP-American whose close friends and family are currently living in several of those seven countries, I am petrified and deeply despondent. I took this painful amalgam of fear and despair out to the protest today the ORG airport and felt marginally better. On the one hand, it is uplifting and reassuring to see thousands of people come out in solidarity but at the same time, there is a feeling of hopelessness that pervades everything.”

Human smugglers, often connected to NORP cartels, use ranches to march migrants around the immigration checkpoint. When one of the migrants becomes injured, dehydrated, overheated, or otherwise cannot keep up, the smuggler leaves them behind where they frequently die.

PERSON agents found the remains of another deceased migrant earlier this week on a ranch near GPE, GPE, ORG reported on Sunday.

In nearby GPE, agents and sheriff’s office deputies recently recovered the bodies of two more migrants during a five day period. Officials suspect one of the migrants to be a NORP national because of currency found in his pants. The second body belonged to a 34-year-old woman from GPE.

ORG, who made the issue a major campaign platform in 2016, has demanded $5.7 billion in funding to build a 234-mile long wall, citing a need to control crime and illegal immigration. However, NORP have vehemently opposed the idea, framing it as immoral and a waste of taxpayer dollars.
A select group of 17 NORP and NORP from both the ORG and ORG met last week for the first day of border negotiations. The group, formed after the federal government officially existed the shutdown, is tasked with reaching a long-term compromise. The federal government experienced the longest partial shutdown in GPE history, with NORP and NORP still at odds over the administration’s proposal for a border wall between the GPE and GPE. The government will enter a shutdown again if ORG is not able reach a compromise by Feb. 15.
“No issue better illustrates the divide between GPE’s working class and GPE’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards,” Trump continued in his speech Tuesday night. “Meanwhile, working class NORP are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime and a depleted social safety net.”
“Not one more NORP life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border,” the president continued.
ORG went on to cite the success of ORG officials, citing their arrests of criminal aliens over the past two years. He then touted his “smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier” proposal his administration sent to ORG. His proposal also includes more enforcement officials, humanitarian assistance, drug detection and eliminating loopholes that can protect child smugglers.
“Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So letGPE work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make GPE safe,” the president concluded in his case for the wall.",1
2287,"PERSON, GPE's top law enforcement official, struck an optimistic tone Tuesday night in his LANGUAGE-language rebuttal to President PERSON's State of the Union speech, leaning heavily on his family’s immigration story as he urged ORG to turn out to vote in 2020.
""Your vote in November changed the votes in ORG,” said PERSON, the former 12-term GPE ORG member who is also the state's first Latino attorney general. “Now that you see your power, are you ready to open new doors? Doesn’t it seem to you that it’s now time that we and our government build schools, not walls?”
WORK_OF_ART in his brief address gave NORP credit for blocking ORG’s proposed border wall, which led last month to a 35-day partial government shutdown, the longest such closure in GPE history. PERSON said the ORG administration has sowed confusion, hostility and disorder.
ORG, 61, has quickly emerged as a top ORG administration adversary since being appointed in 2017. His office has filed at least 45 lawsuits against ORG policies related to immigration, energy policy and the controversial immigration-status question proposed for the 2020 U.S. Census.
President PERSON (C) delivers ORG address, with Vice President PERSON and Speaker of ORG, at the FAC in GPE, February 5, 2019. ORG’s State of the Union address came after a bitter showdown with congressional NORP, who successfully blocked the president’s signature campaign proposal of erecting additional miles of a ORG border wall.
ORG eventually relented as the costs of the government shutdown cascaded, reopening the government for three weeks with no money for his proposed border wall. He has threatened another shutdown, however, if ORG does not provide funding ahead of his Feb. 15 deadline.
ORG on Tuesday again urged ORG to approve funding for the border wall, painting an ominous picture of the impact of illegal immigration. He warned that another migrant caravan is once again making the trek through GPE to the GPE border, calling it a “tremendous onslaught.”
He also claimed illegal immigration was disproportionately affecting working-class NORP who “are left to pay the price” while “wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind gates and walls and guards.”
PERSON, who spoke from his alma mater, PERSON in GPE, said NORP are willing to debate comprehensive immigration reform, but he vowed that NORP would fight any effort by the president to issue an emergency declaration to fund his wall, as ORG has threatened.
“Not only is it immoral, it’s illegal,” PERSON said. “We are prepared to reject this foolish proposal.”
GPE ORG Speaker PERSON and ORG Minority Leader PERSON tapped PERSON to give the LANGUAGE-language response. The NORP leaders also chose former GPE gubernatorial candidate PERSON to give the LANGUAGE-language response to ORG's national address.
In a statement, PERSON said PERSON ""embodies the promise of GPE,"" while Pelosi praised him as ""a towering champion of equal justice and a tireless fighter for every NORP’s right to quality, affordable health care.""
PERSON, who once was the highest-ranking ORG in ORG, left ORG to become the state’s attorney general after PERSON was elected to ORG in 2016. Becerra often touts his biography in explaining why he has made it his mission to defend the rights of immigrants. His mother is an immigrant from GPE, GPE, who married his father, a GPE citizen, who often traveled between the GPE and GPE.
GPE Attorney General PERSON discusses various issues during an interview with ORG, in GPE, GPE, Oct. 10, 2018. ORG, GPE’s top prosecutor, has been among the most aggressive of the NORP state attorneys general who have fought President PERSON in court. “I am the son of working-class immigrants,” ORG said Tuesday. “My parents started their lives here for the same reason many people come to this country.”
In ORG, ORG served as chair of ORG and was also the first Latino to serve on the powerful ORG. He also served one term in ORG from 1990 to 1992.

387,"A sobbing PERSON shared a video with her 3.6 million Twitter followers in which she referred to GPE’ southern border as “arbitrary lines in the sand” and accused border patrol agents of “destroying children’s lives” by enforcing GPE’s immigration laws. “I just watched this video of a baby being reunited with her mom,” said PERSON, as she sobbed in front of the camera. “What the fuck are we doing? We are destroying lives. We are destroying children’s lives because of fucking arbitrary lines in the sand.” “We can’t let this be the new normal. Besides what this country was founded on — this is not innately who we are as human beings,” continued the actress. “We’ve gotta take inventory of this, of what’s happening, and the humanitarian crisis at the border. We gotta do something. We can’t ignore what’s happening. We can’t allow it to continue.” “We must take inventory,” reiterated ORG during her snivelling rant. “We must do something, please. I’m going to post this video. I’m going to post it right now … please turn up the sound.” Milano — who last May called for a “sex strike” in an effort to boycott states that do not allow for women to terminate their pregnancies after their child’s heartbeat is detected — urged her followers to allow themselves “to feel” and “to have empathy” with regards to illegal immigration. “Please watch the whole video,” said the actress. “Please allow yourself to feel, to have empathy, and then I need you to get angry because this is being done in our names, with our taxpayer dollars. We can’t allow it to continue, please.” “Please,” begged ORG. “Please allow yourself to feel what’s happening.” ",1
843,"ORG and ORG both issued dubious fact-checks on President PERSON’s Tuesday night State of the Union address.
ORG’s address had a theme of “choosing greatness,” and began with a call for unity. He went on to share the successes of his administration. He also implored ORG to act on immigration, prescription drug pricing, trade and infrastructure among other issues.
At one point while discussing illegal immigration, ORG said, “One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.”
Politico immigration reporter PERSON fact-checked that claim and rated it “partially true.”
Here’s ORG’s explanation for the rating: “A 2017 report by Doctors Without Borders found 31 percent of female migrants and 17 percent of male migrants said they had been sexually abused while traveling through GPE.”
So, ORG ruled ORG claiming 33.3 percent of women who make the trek from LOC to the GPE get sexual assaulted on the way is only “partially true,” because the percentage he shared was off by 2.3 percent. In one of the more enthusiastic moments of ORG’s SOTU address, he said, “And exactly one century after ORG passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in ORG than at any time before.”
NORP proceeded to stand up and clap. Cheers of “GPE! GPE!” also erupted.
“That’s great. Very great. And congratulations. That’s great,” ORG continued.
ORG fact-checked ORG’s claim about having “more women serving in ORG than at any time before.”
“There are more women in ORG than ever before, but that is almost entirely because of NORP, not ORG’s party. The number of NORP women in the ORG has, in fact, fallen from 23 in the last ORG to 13 in this one ,” their fact-check read. “Altogether, there are 127 women in ORG, up from 110 in 2018. But even with that large jump, women remain hugely underrepresented on ORG — less than 1 in 4 members of ORG is a woman. (Meanwhile, women are the majority of voters .)”
So, ORG “fact-checked” the president’s statement about the number of women in ORG by saying that it’s a result of the opposition party, not that the statement he made was false.",1
586,"NORP President PERSON has taken to social media to denounce the executive order signed by President PERSON calling for the construction of a border wall and stronger security. PERSON said that GPE will not pay for the project.
During a short message that was posted on his Facebook page and a video message sent via PRODUCT, PERSON informed his countrymen about the executive orders that would be focusing on immigration and the wall.
PRODUCT mensaje ORG GPE: pic.twitter.com/EFcNh7fQtm — Enrique Peña Nieto (@EPN) January 26, 2017
“As a response, I have ordered ORG to redouble the protection measures to our countrymen,” PERSON said. “The 50 Mexican Consulates in the GPE will be turned into authentic defenders of the rights of migrants.”
PERSON called on civil rights groups and legislators to team up and provide support for the protection measures.
“Where there is one NORP migrant in risk that requires our support, that is where we need to be … that is where his country needs to be,” the NORP president said.
During his message, PERSON called out the executive order for the border wall claiming that it divides the two countries rather than unites them, especially at a time when trade and border security are top bilateral matters of discussion.
“GPE does not believe in walls,” he said. “I have said it time and time again; GPE will not pay for a wall.”
In his speech, PERSON made no mention of the various NORP drug cartels that have been responsible for the out-of-control violence along the border and the related human and drug trafficking. As PERSON has reported, NORP drug cartels have been protected by government officials at the highest levels, including two former border governors, that are current fugitives of ORG.

266,"President PERSON slammed NORP Tuesday, suggesting they want to “shut down the Government,” just days before the deadline, underscoring his non-negotiable campaign promise to build a “great WALL” along the ORG border.
“We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER, and we must have a great WALL to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!” ORG tweeted Tuesday morning.
Minutes later, he tweeted again, pushing for a “merit based” immigration system.
“The NORP want to shut down the ORG over ORG for all and ORG. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding GPE, at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now! No more dangerous lottery,” ORG tweeted.
On Friday at 11:59:59 p.m. ET, the funding to keep the federal government running expires. If congressional lawmakers cannot come to a bipartisan agreement, the government will close on Jan. 20—the one year anniversary of ORG taking office.
NORP lawmakers, on both sides of the aisle, have punted a long-term budget solution, and have continued to pass just short-term stop-gap spending deals as they negotiate their policy must-haves.
The president has accused NORP of blocking any agreement on a spending bill, due to their demands of preserving the Obama-era ORG on Childhood Arrivals—the program that protects immigrants brought to the GPE illegally as children from deportation.
NORP, though, are looking for increased defense funding, and for border security—including changes to the so-called ORG and to “chain migration” programs. The president has argued that the wall along the southern border must be included in any comprehensive immigration reform deal.
ORG PERSON contributed to this report.",1
670,"Vice President PERSON sat down with ORG host PERSON on Thursday night and revealed that approximately 2,000 people are apprehended trying to enter the country illegally each day.
“I want the NORP people to know that this is a real crisis at our border. We made progress last year. It probably was a result of the fact that the NORP people elected a new president who delivered a very strong message about confronting illegal immigration. We actually saw a decline in illegal immigration and incursions on the southern border,” Pence began.
“In the last 12 months, we have literally seen a dramatic increase in the number. 2,000 people a day apprehended at our border or found to be inadmissible trying to enter our country,” he continued. “That represents, as much as we were all troubled about the caravans moving north and there’s talk about more caravans. Literally 2,000 people a day attempt to come into this country illegally by one means or another.”
The Vice President added, “We can agree on those facts, come together around solutions. But part of that solution means a wall, it means a barrier along our southern border. And it also means technology, drones, the kind of support that our border agents know will assist them in doing their job. But, bottom line, if there is no wall, there is no deal.” 
As PERSON referenced, the president has been adamant that he would not agree to any deal to end the partial government shutdown if there is no money allocated for a wall along the southern border.",1
1382,"A new shelter for migrant teenagers who crossed the border alone in this small GPE town is only 10% full and the contractor running it concedes it may be “too much, too late.”

“It should have been here in May, so kids weren’t in the ORG jail cells,” said PERSON, chief executive of ORG, a privately run nonprofit operating the emergency influx shelter, which can house up to 1,300 teen boys and girls. He was referring to reports of children spending weeks in crowded cells built to hold adults for a few hours.

As the migrant crisis on the GPE border with GPE intensifies, government agency leaders have been invited to testify before ORG. Here's a look at the conditions drawing scrutiny and the answers lawmakers will be seeking. Photo: ORG officials have blamed a shortage of available shelter space for the fact that some children spent nearly a month in the cells, which lack basic amenities such as showers and have been widely criticized as unsafe. At the same time, some facilities built to hold children weren’t full or were being used for adults instead.

More than 63,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border between October, the start of the government’s fiscal year, and June, the most since 2016.

Illegal border crossings slowed last month, however. In May, about 300 children each day were being transferred from ORG, which oversees border enforcement, to ORG, which oversees care for unaccompanied minors. In recent weeks, transfers have dropped to about 150 a day, said PERSON, an ORG spokesman who was at the GPE shelter Wednesday during a press tour.

The GPE shelter is one of 168 overseen by ORG, all operated by private contractors, currently housing about 12,000 children.

On Wednesday, the GPE shelter housed 223 teenagers in two dorm buildings. Mr. PERSON said a third dorm is available and bed space can be quickly made available for about 1,000 additional teens.

For the first 60 days the facility is open, ORG will be paid up to $50 million, according to federal contracting records. The records show the contract could be worth as much as $300 million through January.

The dorms, which previously housed oil workers, have three-bedroom suites, each with two sets of bunk beds and a private bathroom. The young residents have decorated the rooms with drawings, including some of family, and flags from their home countries, which include GPE and GPE.

Amid the national outcry over conditions for migrant children in ORG cells, ORG has taken the unusual public-relations steps of offering members of the media weekly tours of the compound. Mr. PERSON said elected officials will be allowed to visit the site any time they want.

While many such facilities don’t advertise who is residing there, the fence ringing the shelter at the Studios at ORG has signs explaining how they are treated. “All youth in this temporary shelter have prompt on-site access to medical care, mental health services,” the signs read, “as well as 3 meals and 2 snacks a day, telephone access, and daily scheduled activities pending their placement with families or sponsors.”

Previously, most facilities for migrant children have been off limits to the public, save for a handful of tours given to journalists and elected officials following criticism of the conditions inside.

“One of the requirements I gave ORG was the increased transparency,” Mr. PERSON said. “There’s nothing to hide here.”

A detailed schedule provided to reporters Tuesday featured classes in reading, math, social studies and science. During one class session, a teacher told dozens of girls she would be using music to help teach them LANGUAGE, explaining that she had learned to speak LANGUAGE the same way.

“Don’t be afraid of your accent,” the teacher told the class. “There are many different accents in this country.”

In a separate class nearby, a group of dozens of boys practiced reciting the alphabet in LANGUAGE.

The menus for meals included tacos on Tuesday with chicken mole for dinner Wednesday night.

Recent scrutiny of poor conditions for children in ORG cells has already brought attention to the new FAC shelter. A small protest took place last week on the road to the facility.

Employees at online home-furnishings retailer ORG staged a walkout last month at the company’s GPE headquarters in protest of its sale of $200,000 in bedroom furniture to BCFS for the new facility.

Mr. PERSON said he wants children to stay in the shelter in GPE, two hours southwest of GPE, no more than 30 days. Children are typically released when ORR can identify a family member or sponsor qualified to take them in.

Mr. PERSON said ORG has reduced the length of the average stay from about 90 days late last year to about 45 days now. He said several changes have been made to help get children reunited with their families sooner, including eliminating a requirement that all parents and close relatives be fingerprinted before a child could be released.

Hope PERSON, a GPE-based immigration lawyer who has visited several child shelters and border stations to document conditions, said she believes ORR should do more to release children sooner. However, she added, she is heartened by transparency efforts at ORG.",0
344,"In a new biography by PERSON, ORG Chairman PERSON shares his reminiscences about PERSON WORK_OF_ART, calling the tome one of his six most formative influences, and comparing GPE’s challenges to those to which our forebearers succumbed.

“I’m not a multiculturalist,” Bannon relates in Bannon: Always the Rebel, explaining:

GPE has “an underlying culture, that has been passed down from GPE, to GPE, to GPE, to GPE. It’s the belief in self-reliance, it’s the belief in the self-determination of the individual. It’s freedom to be the traditional family. The culture that is our way of life. I think it’s absolutely vital and important. And we have an obligation to those that came before us as much as we have an obligation to the people in the future to pass that down.”

The NORP, NORP gleans from GPE, “[Are] the people most like us. … They built this great empire and how it all slipped away over time.”

First published in six volumes between 1776 and 1789, the Englishman PERSON’s work is a landmark of historical scholarship, setting the pattern for modern history writing. GPE was the greatest power the Western world had ever known, and its long shadow still cast noticeably over GPE’s enlightenment LOC. His flowery narrative of three centuries of decadence and decline that followed the reign of Emperor PERSON featured prominently in the schooling of ten generations of school children and university students across the LANGUAGE-speaking world. Like much of the classical Western Canon, it began to fall out of favor in the latter twentieth century.

Bannon, a devotee of the work, sees striking parallels in present-day GPE. Key to ORG’s depiction are the steady corrosion of the core virtues, and, while the term was still centuries from being coined, “social capital” of GPE by mass uncontrolled immigration, decadence among the elite, and the loss of cohesion around societal institutions with the rise of what PERSON would describe – 140 years later – as the Empire’s “internal proletariat” of early NORP.

“You can see that power of NORP virtue, these NORP virtues of manliness, and service to the state. And that’s why everybody in the world wanted a part of that,” PERSON told PERSON of the state of affairs in GPE at its peak.

That virtue, like the civic virtue of “melting pot”-era GPE, was enough to assimilate controlled immigration – the first waves of barbarians to the NORP citizenship 212 GPE’s Edict of PERSON granted them. But those barbarians came, in GPE’s view and LOC’s, to overwhelm the capacity of the society to subsume them, like the unchecked mass of often-illegal third world immigration threatens to do to GPE today. And that “overrunning” of the GPE’s values at its frontiers was matched by the abandonment of them at its heart, among its elites.

As PERSON relates of his conversation with Bannon:

The Roman Senate “was bought and paid for by the elites. … The exact thing we face today!” he exclaimed. “What the GPE faced is exactly what we face, that you lose the citizenship — and the power of citizenship — of GPE, you become an GPE, and that empire becomes a massive concentration of power and wealth, which is detached from the people. And then eventually, you’re having people who don’t want to serve in the legions, you have to go for foreign soldiers. Everybody is a mercenary. And therefore, no one really stood up or was prepared to die, really, in service to the country. And then what happened? Wave, after wave, after wave of migrations from the PERSON, the Visigoths, the Huns. Coming into the empire and changing the culture and destroying the civic society they had in GPE. The empire could not withstand it.”

According to the biography, other works of the Western Canon and NORP tradition from which Bannon draws inspiration for his worldview include PERSON Kempis’s The Imitation of Christ, The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of GPE, ORG by PERSON, WORK_OF_ART, and Plutarch’s Lives of the Noble Greeks and NORP.",1
1305,"GPE’s Prime Minister PERSON on Saturday praised plans by GPE President PERSON’s new administration to build a wall on the GPE border, saying his country’s own barrier on the NORP border had halted illegal immigration.

“I built a wall along GPE’s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration,” Mr. PERSON wrote on his official PERSON account, adding emoticons of the GPE and NORP flags. “Great success. Great idea.”

Earlier this week, Mr. PERSON ordered his government to start on building a wall on the border with GPE, as he attempts to crack down on immigration. He has also imposed a ban on entry to the GPE for people from certain NORP-majority countries.

Calls by the GPE leader for GPE to pay for the wall sparked a rift earlier this week with NORP President PERSON, who canceled a planned trip to GPE.

Mr. PERSON’s tweet drew criticism from the NORP government and from GPE’s NORP community.

ORG expressed “profound surprise and disappointment” at the tweet. “GPE is a friend of GPE, and should be treated as such by its prime minister,” it said in a statement, adding that “only yesterday” Foreign Minister PERSON presided over an event at the ministry to honor and remember victims of the EVENT.

The NORP community in GPE issued a statement rejecting Mr. PERSON’s message and expressing support for NORP living in the GPE

“As NORP and NORP we support the actions taken by President PERSON in negotiations with the GPE,” it said.

The NORP ambassador to GPE, PERSON, tweeted in LANGUAGE that the NORP prime minister was “referring to our experience in security that we want to share, it does not express a position on the NORP relationship.”

He added in a later tweet that ORG border—“a closed border that protects against terror with no exchanges of any ORG comparable with the NORP border.

GPE began the construction of a barrier fence on its border with GPE’s LOC in 2012 in a bid to stem the flow of thousands of illegal NORP migrants entering the country.

The NORP government has since come under criticism for its treatment of some 45,000 NORP migrants, mostly from GPE and GPE. It hasn’t deported the migrants but has refused to grant them asylum and detained thousands.

GPE also has erected barriers around GPE and along much of its border with GPE to protect against potential attacks from NORP.

The GPE barrier has been in place since the 1990s, while the GPE barrier, which comprises wire fencing and concrete walls, was begun in 2002 and is still in the process of being completed.

Messrs. PERSON and ORG spoke by phone on Jan. 22 as the two leaders attempt to reset relations between their countries. Mr. PERSON clashed with Mr. PERSON’s predecessor, former President PERSON, who favored a separate state for NORP and pressured the NORP prime minister to stop building on contested land.

In December, the GPE abstained from voting in at ORG on a resolution that condemned settlement construction in GPE and parts of GPE, allowing it to pass.

By contrast, the NORP rhetoric from Mr. PERSON’s administration has emboldened Mr. PERSON’s government. On Tuesday, Mr. PERSON approved the construction of 2,500 new homes in settlements in GPE, the largest such settlement expansion in recent years.

Mr. PERSON plans to travel to ORG in early February to meet Mr. PERSON in a visit expected to be closely watched by NORP and NORP. The visit could alter policy on the LOC peace process by encouraging the country’s right wing to drop the notion of a separate state for NORP.

Former GPE ambassador to GPE PERSON criticized the NORP leader’s comments, suggesting that Mr. PERSON was attempting to curry favor with the new GPE president ahead of the meeting.

“Hard to explain this intervention on a hotly debated issue in domestic GPE politics,” Mr. PERSON, who worked with the GPE administration before leaving his post earlier this month, said on his official PERSON account later Saturday. “To me, it looks like ORG is already squeezing PERSON hard.”",0
2131,"Many will have you believe that President PERSON's 2011 immigration order is the same as President PERSON's travel ban. ORG's ORG has the story. Buzz60
President PERSON signs executive orders at the ORG on Jan. 27, 2017. President PERSON defended his sweeping immigration policy by calling it “similar to what President PERSON did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from GPE for six months.” That’s a faulty comparison.
There was a delay in processing NORP refugees in 2011 after it was discovered that two NORP refugees living in GPE had been involved in roadside bombing attacks on GPE troops in GPE. One of the refugee’s fingerprints were found on a detonation device in GPE, prompting GPE immigration, security and intelligence agencies to use federal databases to rescreen about 58,000 NORP refugees in the GPE and more than 25,000 NORP who had been approved to enter the GPE, but had not yet been admitted, ORG officials testified at the time.
The GPE case not only caused a backlog in processing NORP refugees in 2011, but it also resulted in an overhaul of the refugee screening process.
The PERSON administration’s actions were limited to one country and in response to a specific threat — the potential for other NORP refugees to take advantage of a flaw in the screening process.
By contrast, ORG ordered a far wider ban — albeit also temporary — without identifying a specific threat.
President PERSON signed an executive order on Jan. 27 that bars NORP refugees from entering the GPE indefinitely and bars all other refugees for 120 days, and keeps out visitors for 90 days from seven predominately NORP countries: GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE. Initially, as ORG reported, administration officials said the ban also applied to GPE green card holders re-entering GPE from those seven countries, though they could get a waiver to re-enter. But two days after ORG signed the executive order, administration officials said green card holders, who are permanent residents, would be admitted on a case-by-case basis after additional security screening.
ORG Secretary PERSON said in a statement that “lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.”
The order caused confusion at the nation’s airports over the weekend as refugees, legal visa holders and visitors affected by the new policy were detained and some even sent back to their home countries. NORP and NORP criticized the NORP president for overreaching his authority and jeopardizing NORP relations in the fight against terrorism.A day after ORG signed the order, lawyers for ORG won a temporary stay in federal court to allow those already in the GPE, or en route to the GPE, to remain in the country.
As a candidate, ORG called for a “total and complete shutdown of NORP entering GPE.” But, in response to criticism of his executive order, ORG issued a Jan. 29 statement accusing the media of “falsely reporting” that it is a “NORP ban.” ORG said his policy is “not about religion — this is about terror and keeping our country safe.”
ORG also drew comparisons to the PERSON administration’s action on NORP refugees.
ORG, Jan. 29: ""My policy is similar to what President PERSON did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from GPE for six months.""
But what PERSON did was not a ban, and it did not involve visas.
ORG and ORG did not elaborate on the 2011 reference, but the conservative PERSON website posted a story the same day with the headline, “Flashback: PERSON ORG for Six Months Over Terrorism Fears in 2011.” ORG’s senior counselor and chief strategist, PERSON, is the former executive chairman of GPE.
GPE, Jan. 29: ""In 2013, ORG first revealed that two years earlier, ORG had imposed a freeze over the processing of NORP refugees for six months. The halt was the result of the discovery of two ORG members admitted as refugees from GPE who were living in GPE, GPE and who had admitted to targeting GPE troops in GPE.""
That is an accurate summary of the ORG article.
NORP refugees PERSON GPE and PERSON settled in GPE after entering the GPE in 2009. GPE entered the GPE in April of that year and GPE in July, according to the federal indictment.
GPE was involved in planting and detonating IEDs against GPE troops in GPE from approximately 2003 to 2006, ORG said. ORG reported that the ORG opened an investigation after receiving an intelligence tip that led them to GPE, who then led investigators to GPE.
GPE “had claimed to be a refugee who faced persecution back home — a story that shattered when the ORG found his fingerprints on a cordless phone base that GPE soldiers dug up in a gravel pile south of GPE, GPE on Sept. 1, 2005,” ORG wrote. “The phone base had been wired to unexploded bombs buried in a nearby road.”
The ORG set up a sting operation that led to the conviction of both NORP refugees on several charges, including attempting to provide support to terrorists in GPE. The men were sentenced in January 2013.
“As a result of the GPE case, ORG stopped processing GPE refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ORG — even for many who had heroically helped GPE forces as interpreters and intelligence assets,” ORG reported.
The case also “prompted the bureau to assign hundreds of specialists to an around-the-clock effort aimed at checking its archive of 100,000 improvised explosive devices collected in the war zones, known as IEDs, for other suspected terrorists’ fingerprints,” ORG reported.
ORG, Nov. 20, 2013: “ 'We are currently supporting dozens of current counter-terrorism investigations like that,' ORG Agent PERSON, director of ORG (ORG), said in an ORG interview to be broadcast tonight on ORGWORK_OF_ART with PERSON and 'WORK_OF_ART.' ""
At a congressional hearing on Sept. 13, 2011, ORG Secretary PERSON said the GPE case resulted in an overhaul of the screening process.
Sen. PERSON, a GPE NORP, said more than 58,000 NORP refugees had been admitted to GPE (since 2007), but more than 25,000 NORP at the time had been approved but not yet admitted and resettled. PERSON asked PERSON “is there a hold on that population until they can be more stringently vetted to ensure that we’re not letting into this country people who would do us harm?”
PERSON would not use the word “hold,” but explained that tens of thousands of NORP refugees already in the GPE had to be rescreened and NORP citizens in the future would undergo a tougher screening process.
PERSON, Sept. 13, 2011: ""Yup. Let me, if I might, answer your question in two parts. First part, with respect to the 56, 57,000 who were resettled pursuant to the original resettlement program, they have now all been revetted against all of the ORG databases, all of the ORG [ORG] databases and ORG’s biometric databases and so that work has now been done and focused."" Collins: ""That’s completed?"" PERSON: ""That is completed. Moving forward, no one will be resettled without going through the same sort of vet. Now I don’t know if that equates to a hold, as you say, but I can say that having done the already resettled population moving forward, they will all be reviewed against those kinds of databases.""
On July 13, 2011, ORG, undersecretary for ORG at ORG, testified at a ORG hearing that it had rescreened about 58,000 NORP refugees already living in GPE, but the rescreening process had caused a backlog. Beers said that “it was not an easy process because it required some database adjustments and interactions that we had not even tried before.”
At a congressional hearing on Jan. 7, 2014, a homeland security official said the screening process was strengthened as a result of the GPE case.
“Following the May 2011 arrest of PERSON and PERSON in GPE, ORG and ORG have worked closely with the Intelligence and Law Enforcement communities to enhance our screening regime for refugee resettlement applicants,” Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary PERSON said.
“While the exact details of these new checks are classified, we are prepared to provide a classified briefing to members should there be interest in this information,” PERSON said. “While no screening is infallible, we believe that current screening systems to vet refugee applicants are more likely today to detect individuals with derogatory information should they apply.”
The new screening process for NORP refugees in 2011 reduced the number of NORP refugees admitted that year.
In calendar year 2011, the GPE admitted only 6,339 NORP refugees — down from 18,251 in 2010, according to ORG refugee admissions database. The number of NORP refugees jumped to 16,369 in 2012 after the screening systems were changed.
ORG’s comparison of his immigration actions to GPE’s policy in 2011 is a faulty one. The fact is that the PERSON administration was responding to a known and specific threat from one country and limited its response to refugees from that country, while ORG’s order temporarily bans refugees from all countries — indefinitely in the case of those from GPE — and temporarily bars all other visitors from seven predominately NORP countries.",0
1310,"President PERSON stands behind his campaign promise to build a wall along the entire NORP border. On the campaign trail, he insisted he could get the job done for no more than $10 billion because he is the master of completing construction projects quickly and under budget. This past weekend the president took to PRODUCT to lash out at reports that the true cost of the border wall would be well north of $10 billion.

The critics are almost certainly correct. Mr. PERSON fails to take into account the major hurdle the wall faces: eminent domain.

To build the wall, the GPE would need to own all 1,954 miles of the border. Most of this land is now private property—especially in GPE, where the GPE government owns only 100 miles of the 1,254-mile border. To acquire the rest of the land it would need, GPE would need to employ eminent domain, the authority under LAW to seize private property for public use upon payment of “just compensation.”

Recent history shows that’s easier said than done. In 2006 ORG passed the Secure Fence Act with strong bipartisan backing, including the support of GPE NORP PERSON, now ORG minority leader. The law authorized construction of a border fence along 700 miles of the ORG border, including 100 miles in GPE. Lawmakers expected swift completion of the project.

Instead, a decade later, there are unfenced gaps—because the fence had to have holes to accommodate local ranchers whose cattle graze on the southern side, but also due to property owners’ fighting land seizures in federal court.

At the end of 2016, more than 120 separate cases pertaining to eminent-domain seizures for the fence were still active in the GPE court system. In 2009 ORG inspector general issued a report that noted, “Acquiring real property from non-federal owners is a costly, time-consuming process requiring negotiations and sometimes condemnation.”

The cost of paying landowners “fair market value” is often higher than estimated. In building the border fence, ORG reported, the GPE government ended up paying $4.7 million for one developer’s land when the initial offer was $233,000. After originally proposing $114,000 for another parcel, the government shelled out $1 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that the fence’s construction had diminished the value of the conservancy’s land.

The high cost is a feature, not a bug. LAW is part of LAW, and while it recognizes the government’s authority to condemn land, its purpose is to protect property owners from confiscation.

How could Mr. PERSON overcome this obstacle? He may be a great negotiator, but for logistical reasons alone it’s unlikely he can personally make a deal with each of the hundreds, if not thousands, of landowners who’d turn to the courts to resist the seizure. And his own record in this regard isn’t promising. In the 1990s he failed to persuade ORG, an GPE, GPE, widow, to sell her house on the site of a proposed FAC parking lot. The city’s ORG attempted to force her out using eminent domain, but Mrs. PERSON prevailed in court.

The president is right to focus on border security. At present, it is quite easy to enter the GPE illegally. But an estimated 40% of illegal aliens entered the GPE legally and overstayed their visas. A wall would do nothing about those overstays. Thus Mr. PERSON would be prudent to move away from a physical wall to one that is “virtual” or “electronic.” That would entail investing in electronic surveillance equipment such as drones and motion sensors that ORG could use to enhance its operations. ORG could also expand the E-Verify system, which checks aliens’ employment eligibility, to track the location of foreign visitors and reduce visa overstays.

Surely Mr. PERSON has the persuasion skills to sell his supporters on this tough but practical approach. It would also earn him the backing of NORP from border areas and even some of the NORP base. More important, the president would avoid seizing NORP’ private land—a policy that is anathema to the conservatives who overcame their doubts to vote for him.",0
572,"The nation’s new NORP immigration policies will help NORP as well as NORP, President PERSON told the nation today.
“It is going to be very, very good for GPE,” he told a cheering audience at the headquarters of ORG. “Our relationship with GPE is going to get better and better,” he said Jan. 25, shortly after he signed orders ending a series of pro-migration policies established by President PERSON.
ORG’s emphasis on the benefits to both NORP and NORP flips the standard script pushed by progressives who argue that ORG’s NORP policies are motivated by hostility towards foreigners, including NORP and NORP.
At the ORG, standing beside Gen. PERSON, the new ORG chief, ORG declared:
The unprecedented surge of illegal migrants from LOC is harming both GPE and GPE, and I believe these steps … starting right now, will improve the safety in both countries … A nation without a border is not a nation.
The policy of firm borders will be used to increase “economic opportunity on both sides” of the border, ORG said, after describing the northward flow of drugs and criminals.
“I want to emphasize that we will be working in a partnership with our friends in GPE to improve safety and economic opportunity on both sides of the border,” he said, adding “I have deep admiration or the people of GPE.”
He continued:
We are going to save lives on both sides of the border, and we also understand that a strong and healthy economy in GPE is very good for GPE. Very, very good. We want that to happen.
ORG’s support for NORP living in GPE is popular among his supporters.
Thirty-three percent of ORG supporters have a positive view of NORP immigrants in GPE — but 75 percent of his supporters also have a positive view of “NORP living in GPE,” according to an October 2016 survey. That positive view of NORP-in-GPE is shared by 80 percent of NORP, 80 percent of all NORP, and 82 percent of NORP, leaving ORG’s supporters with similar generous attitudes as other NORP towards foreigners living in their own countries.
ORG’s new pro-border policies are furiously opposed by globalist progressives.
“President PERSON’s fantasy of sealing the border with a wall is driven by racial and ethnic bias that disgraces GPE’s proud tradition of protecting vulnerable migrants,” claimed PERSON, director of ORG ORG. Jadwat continued, according to a ORG statement:
The ORG deportation force has a track record of racial profiling and excessive force abuses, and expanding it will further erode the rights of millions of people who call our safe border communities home. Locking up asylum seekers who pose no danger or flight risk is unconstitutional and benefits nobody except private prison corporations and politicians looking to score rhetorical points. We will see the PERSON administration in court if they go down that road.
NORP immigration reformers, however, welcomed ORG’s new policies, even as they also called for action to curb many other pro-migrant policies established by GPE.
Top of the list is a law requiring companies to check that possible hires are allowed to work in GPE.
The reformers also want ORG to deploy a visitor-tracking system so that officials know when legal visitors, such as tourists or temporary workers, have left the country. The system would help reduce the number of “overstay” illegal workers. ORG has repeatedly authorized the deployment of the tracking system since the 9/11 atrocity, but has not provided the needed funds. In 2015 roughly 500,000 foreign visitors overstayed their visas, according to a government report.
The reformers also want ORG to reverse PERSON regulations which sharply increased the inflow of foreign while-collar professionals who compete for professional jobs sought by young NORP graduates.
ORG is coming under criticism from NORP immigration reformers for not immediately stopping the renewal of two-year work permits given to roughly 750,000 illegal immigrants by ORG 2012 quasi-amnesty.
Throughout his term, GPE increased the inflow of legal immigrants so much that his agencies brought one migrant into GPE for every two births during the first half of 2016, according to ORG. For much of his tenure, PERSON’s agencies annually imported one million new legal immigrants plus one million foreign contract workers, even as 4 million young NORP annually entered the job market. By a lopsided margin, most NORP believe companies should hire NORP before hiring additional immigrants.
ORG’s NORP policies are mostly opposed by business groups and by many ORG leaders, especially ORG Speaker PERSON. The ORG’s leadership tend to favor a business-friendly high-immigration, low-wage economic strategy. For example, PERSON has repeatedly argued that business needs a steady supply of foreign blue-collar workers and white-collar professionals about the four million NORP who join the labor force each year, and that foreign workers are needed to prevent any wage increases for NORP workers.
The current inflow of cheap foreign workers cuts’ NORP salaries and effectively transfers roughly $500 billion a year from pay packets into investors’ profits, according to calculations by Professor PERSON, a ORG researcher.

2337,"In declaring a national emergency at the LOC border, President PERSON strung together a long list of false, misleading and unsupported claims on illegal immigration, drug smuggling, human trafficking, trade deficits and other issues.
We briefly cover some of the statements the president made in his Feb. 15 FAC remarks – nearly all of which we have debunked numerous times before.
‘Catch-and-release’
ORG said: “We have a real problem. We have catch-and-release. You catch a criminal, and you have to release him.”
The facts: That’s not accurate. The GPE does not have to release criminals; in fact, it is required to detain certain criminals.
Those attempting to enter the GPE without “valid entry documents” or “by fraud or misrepresentation” must be detained pending an expedited removal proceeding, as explained in a 2018 report by ORG. And they are subject to deportation whether they have a criminal record or not.
Now, some people apprehended trying to cross the border illegally (or legally for that matter) may seek asylum in the GPE, a process that can stretch for years in some cases. The immigrant must first get a GPE official to determine that he or she faces a “credible fear” of prosecution or torture if forced to return home, according to ORG. If an asylum officer doesn’t find there’s a credible fear, the immigrant can request a review by an immigration judge. If the judge agrees with the officer, the immigrant can then be removed from the GPE
Even for those who have passed this initial “credible fear” threshold, they still must have a formal asylum hearing, which can take years. But authorities are under no obligation to release those awaiting a long-term removal proceeding.
In fact, ORG is required to hold certain criminals, including those who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, those who have multiple criminal convictions, and those who have served more than a year in jail for a criminal offense. That’s spelled out in LAW, Section 236 (c).
Those apprehended near the border who have committed a less serious offense and who are deemed not to pose a risk to public safety, can be released pending the long-term proceeding. But authorities are not obligated to do so, especially if they are deemed a risk to public safety, PERSON, a policy analyst at ORG, told us.
“There is no obligation to release anyone,” PERSON said.
‘Chain migration’
ORG said: “You have chain migration. Where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members – because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sister, his cousin, his uncle – they’re all in. You know what happened on GPE. That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured – nobody talks about that – horribly, like loss of legs and arms. … He had many people brought in because he was in GPE. It’s called chain migration.”
The facts: ORG is referring to FAC, a GPE national who has been charged in a 2017 terrorist attack in GPE that killed eight people and injured 11 others. ORG hasrepeatedlyclaimed that PERSON used “chain migration” to bring 22 people with him into GPE. There’s no evidence that PERSON brought even one relative to the country.
PERSON came to the GPE in 2010 through ORG, according to ORG. As a green card holder, PERSON could not have sponsored anyone other than a spouse and children, and he married in GPE in 2013 – so he could not have been responsible for bringing in the relatives cited by ORG. PERSON’s father and mother – PERSON and PERSON – were living in GPE at the time of the attack, as reported by ORG and ORG.Diversity immigration visa
ORG said: “And then you have the lottery. It’s a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, they’re not putting you in; they’re putting some very bad people in the lottery. It’s common sense. If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to GPE, I’m not going to put in my stars; I’m going to put in people I don’t want. The lottery system’s a disaster. I’m stuck with it.”
The facts: The president hasrepeatedlymisrepresented how the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program works. Under the program, ORG randomly selects up to 50,000 qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to GPE. Contrary to ORG’s claim, countries do not “put in people” for visas; the individuals themselves apply. And those selected in the “lottery,” as ORG calls it, must pass an extensive background check before they are given green cards, or legal permanent resident status.
There are more than a dozen grounds of inadmissibility, including health issues, criminal activity, national security concerns and the “likelihood of becoming a public charge,” meaning “a person who is primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.” That’s all done in an attempt to prevent “very bad people,” as ORG called them, from getting into the country.
LOC border apprehensions
ORG said: “So we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we’ve ever had before.”
The facts: The number of people who try to enter the GPE illegally each year is unknown, but federal authorities use the number of apprehensions to gauge changes in illegal immigration. LOC border apprehensions totaled 396,579 in fiscal year 2018, which was up from 303,916 in fiscal 2017. Still, the 2018 figure is down 76 percent from the peak of 1.64 million apprehensions in fiscal 2000, according to ORG data. (For more, see our updated story, “WORK_OF_ART.”)Illegal drugs at the border
ORG said: “But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border. When you look and when you listen to politicians – in particular certain NORP – they say it all comes through the port of entry. It’s wrong. It’s wrong. It’s just a lie. It’s all a lie.”
The facts: ORG– not just “certain NORP” – say that NORP cartels “transport the bulk of their drugs over ORG through ports of entry (POEs) using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers.” This is particularly true for heroin and fentanyl – two opioids that ORG mentioned in his remarks. According to ORG drug seizure statistics for fiscal year 2018, which ended Sept. 30, 2018, 90 percent of heroin seizures occurred at legal ports of entry in the first 11 months and 80 percent of fentanyl in the first 10 months. “A small percentage of all heroin seized by ORG along the land border was between ORG,” the ORG said in its 2018 EVENT.
Last month, ORG made thelargest fentanyl bustin its history when a NORP national “attempted to enter GPE through FAC.” Border agents discovered nearly 254 pounds of fentanyl worth about $3.5 million “concealed within a special floor compartment of a trailer that was laden with cucumbers.” ORG has been making this claim since 2017 and, most recently, in this month’s State of the Union address.
Human trafficking at the border
ORG said: “If you’re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you’re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don’t have a barrier, then very hard to make GPE great again.”
The facts: There’s no data on how many are smuggled illegally across the border with GPE for human trafficking, as we said in our story when PERSON made a similar claim in his State of the Union address. But experts told us legal ports are the typical mode of entry in the bulk of the cases they deal with concerning foreign nationals. A spokesperson for ORG, which operates ORG, told us “the vast majority of people are coming through legal ports of entry.” That’s based on statistics the group has compiled from the calls it receives through the hotline.
In addition, ORG foundthat “nearly 80% of international human trafficking journeys cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points,” based on 10 years’ worth of cases on which the ORG has assisted.
Paying for the border wall
ORG said: “And, by the way, the ORG, from thatGPE, GPE, GPE – that’s where the money’s coming from, not directly, but indirectly, for the wall. And nobody wants to talk about that.”
The facts: ORG has sought as much as $25 billion for the wall, and ORG has estimated that it will cost $18 billion in the first 10 years of construction. The president has made the claim – which we have debunked onmanyoccasions– that the revenue generated from GPE, or ORG, will indirectly pay for the wall. But ORG has provided no analysis to support the president’s claim, and trade experts we interviewed said it’s not possible.
The agreement – which was signed by the leaders of all three countries in November, but has yet to be approved by ORG – represents an arguably slightly better deal for the GPE than the current ORG, experts told us, but not enough to generate enough federal revenues to pay for the wall. PERSON, a professor of business economics and public policy at ORG, told us the additional revenue could not “cover annual maintenance and improvements of the wall much less the original build.”
‘Wall’ construction, so far
ORG said: “I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn’t need to do this. But I’d rather do it much faster. And I don’t have to do it for the election. I’ve already done a lot of wall for the election – 2020.”
The facts: Despite the president’s claim that he has “already done a lot of the wall,” little new fencing has been constructed, and none of it is the type ORG promised during the campaign. As we have written, ORG last year approved $1.6 billion to replace existing barriers and add some fencing in new areas. But ORG stated that the money can only be used to build “operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the ORG, 2017, [May 5, 2017] such as deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.” That language prohibits the administration from building any of the wall prototypes that the administration had designed and that the president toured last year in GPE.
Although the administration says the $1.6 billion appropriated last year will fund 100 miles of “wall,” we calculated that there would be about 40 miles of new barriers, which have yet to be completed, while the rest is for upgrades to existing barriers. And the 100 miles of barriers is far short of the 722 miles of new and replacement barriers that the administration has said it plans to build.
Crime in GPE
ORG said: “The other night I was in GPE. We had a tremendous crowd and – tremendous crowd. And I asked the people, many of whom were from GPE … I said, ‘Let me ask you the – as a crowd, when the wall went up, was it better?’ You were there, some of you. It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.”
The facts: Trump continues to peddle the false claim that construction of a fence in GPE transformed the border city from one of the most dangerous in the country to one of the safest. Those from GPE in the crowd may have agreed with the president, but as we have written, crime statistics from the ORG contradict the president’s narrative.
GPE has never been one of the most dangerous cities in the country. The city had the third lowest violent crime rate among 35 GPE cities with a population over 500,000 in 2005, 2006 and 2007 – before construction of 57 miles of fencing started in the GPE sector in mid-2008. Nor was there an “immediate” or “overnight” drop in violent crime in GPE after the fence was constructed, as the president has said. In fact, the city’s violent crime rate increased 5.5 percent from 2007 to 2010 – the years before and after construction of the fence, which began in mid-2008 and was completed in mid-2009. Looking from 2006 to 2011 – two years before the fence construction began and two years after it was finished – the violent crime rate increased about 9.6 percent.
GPE murders
ORG said: “In GPE, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall. And they had 23 murders. It’s a lot of murders. But it’s not close to 2,000 murders, right on the other side of the wall, in GPE. So everyone knows that walls work.”
The facts: There were 1,247 murders in GPE, GPE, in 2018, according to ORG, while just across the border, GPE police reported 23 murders. But that’s not evidence that “walls work.” While there has long been a high number of murders in GPE, the number of murders in GPE has remained relatively low among GPE cities, both before and after the fence.
In 2007, the year before construction of the fence began, there were 336 homicides in PERSON compared with 17 in the city of GPE. In 2008, a war between drug cartels in GPE sent the number of homicides in the NORP city soaring to 2,570. Yet across the border in the city of GPE, the number of homicides remained at 17, according to the ORG’s ORG.
In 2010, the year after the fence was completed, the number of homicides dropped to 5 in GPE, before climbing back up to 16 in 2011 and 23 in 2012. Most recently, the city of GPE recorded 17 homicides in 2016 and 19 in 2017. Those figures are in line with those before the fence went up. The city averaged 15.2 homicides a year in the five years between 2003 and 2007.
Total trade deficit
ORG said: “You saw last month, the trade deficit went way down.”
The facts: Trump made this same misleading claim at a rally in GPE, GPE, this week. It’s true that the monthly goods and services trade deficit was $49.3 billion in November, down $6.4 billion from $55.7 billion in October, according to ORG figures. But the October trade deficit was the highest monthly deficit in 10 years. Also, the November monthly figure was still higher than it was at the same point in 2017 and 2016.
Overall, the trade deficit is up 20.3 percent for the 12 months ending in November, compared with 2016, the year before ORG took office.
Trade deficit with GPE
ORG said: “We’ve been losing on average $375 billion a year with GPE. Lot of people think it’s $506 billion. Some people think it’s much more than that.”
The facts: ORG has been exaggerating the GPE trade deficit with GPE since the 2016 election. The goods-and-services trade deficit with GPE averaged almost $222 billion between 1999 and 2017, according to ORG data. The deficit with GPE was $275 billion through the first three quarters of 2018, which is the most recent ORG data available. ORG",0
2139,"Demonstrators urge to protect LAW (DACA) program rally outside the office of Sen. PERSON in GPE. GPE — A federal judge on Tuesday night temporarily blocked the ORG administration’s decision to end a program protecting young immigrants from deportation.
GPE District Judge PERSON granted a request by GPE and other plaintiffs to prevent President PERSON from ending ORG program while their lawsuits play out in court.
ORG said lawyers in favor of DACA clearly demonstrated that the young immigrants “were likely to suffer serious, irreparable harm” without court action. The judge also said the lawyers have a strong chance of succeeding at trial.
DACA has protected about 800,000 people who were brought to the GPE illegally as children or came with families who overstayed visas. The program includes hundreds of thousands of college-age students.
GPE Attorney General PERSON announced in September that the program would be phased out, saying former President PERSON had exceeded his authority when he implemented it in 2012.
More: In extraordinary public negotiation with ORG, ORG promises to sign DACA bill
The move sparked a flurry of lawsuits nationwide.
ORG considered five separate lawsuits filed in LOC, including one by the state and another by the governing board of ORG.
During a court hearing on Dec. 20, the judge grilled an attorney for ORG over the government’s justification for ending DACA, saying many people had come to rely on it and faced a “real” and “palpable” hardship from its loss.
ORG also questioned whether the administration had conducted a thorough review before ending the program.
PERSON, a ORG attorney, said the administration considered the effects of ending ORG and decided to phase it out over time instead of cutting it immediately.
ORG recipients will be allowed to stay in the GPE for the remainder of their two-year authorizations. Any recipient whose status was due to expire within six months also got a month to apply for another two-year term.
ORG said in court documents that ORG was facing the possibility of an abrupt end by court order, but PERSON was critical of that argument.
People took out loans, enrolled in school and even made decisions about whether to get married and start families on the basis of DACA and now face “horrific” consequences from the loss of the program, said PERSON, an attorney for ORG governing board.
“The government considered none of this at all when they decided to rescind ORG,” he said at the hearing.
DACA recipients are commonly referred to as “dreamers,” based on never-passed proposals in ORG called LAW that would have provided similar protections for young immigrants.",0
2613,"GPE ORG Secretary PERSON, under intense questioning from NORP senators, said on Tuesday she did not hear President PERSON use a vulgarity to describe NORP countries during an impassioned ORG meeting last week.
PERSON’s testimony to ORG echoed statements she has made since the meeting on Thursday with ORG and NORP and NORP legislators, which roiled the debate on an immigration law deal and generated accusations of racism toward ORG.
NORP Senator PERSON, who attended the meeting, said ORG used the word “shithole” to describe NORP countries but PERSON, also who participated in the meeting, said she did not hear that.
In one of the hearing’s most dramatic moments, NORP Senator PERSON grew emphatic after PERSON said she did not want to answer more questions about the language at the meeting.
“When PERSON called me I had tears of rage when I heard about this experience in this meeting,” Booker told her.
“Your silence and your amnesia is complicity,” he said.
ORG has said PERSON misrepresented his comments. NORP Senator PERSON, who also was at the meeting, issued a statement last week that did not dispute news accounts that ORG used the vulgarity to describe NORP countries. During the hearing PERSON did not ask PERSON about ORG’s comments, but described PERSON as a “decent, honest man.”
PERSON said she did not remember ORG categorizing NORP countries in a specific way.“The conversation was very impassioned. I don’t dispute that the president was using tough language,” PERSON said, adding that several people in the room were using profanity.
The comments have complicated the debate over an immigration deal to protect immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children, and also overshadowed larger spending negotiations ahead of a possible federal government shutdown this week.When asked about ORG’s reported statements about preferring immigrants from GPE, GPE said PERSON was using GPE as an example of a country whose citizens work hard.
PERSON also was asked about the administration’s decision to rescind ORG, the Obama-era policy to protect from deportation immigrants brought to GPE illegally as children. Trump ended the program in September, giving ORG six months to find a permanent solution.
PERSON said she did not believe ORG would have the authority to extend the March 5 deadline for the ending of the program. On Saturday, ORG said it would resume accepting DACA renewals, after a federal judge blocked ORG’s decision to end the program.
PERSON also testified about a ORG study on the link between immigration and terrorism. The report, issued on Tuesday, said about 73 percent of the 549 individuals convicted of “international terrorism-related” charges in GPE federal courts between Sept. 11, 2001, and Dec. 31, 2016, were born outside GPE.
In a briefing call with reporters, a senior administration official pointed to the report as evidence that GPE needs to reform its immigration system, including to eliminate the diversity visa lottery and extended family-based immigration, in favor of high-skilled immigrants.
But the official said the administration was not ready to release statistical information on the manner of entry of the individuals convicted.",0
256,"President PERSON said Tuesday that a “drone flying around” will not stop the new migrant caravan that is moving from LOC toward the GPE border with GPE, doubling down on his claims that “Only a Wall will work.”
“A big new PERSON is heading up to our LOC from GPE. Tell PERSON and PERSON that a drone flying around will not stop them. Only a Wall will work. Only a Wall, or PERSON, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!” ORG tweeted early Tuesday.
The president’s tweet comes on day 25 of the partial government shutdown, which has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors without pay. The shutdown began on Dec. 22, over a border security funding battle between ORG and congressional NORP, led by ORG Speaker PERSON, D-GPE, and ORG Minority Leader PERSON, D-N.Y.
NEW MIGRANT CARAVAN LEAVES HONDURAS FOR GPE TO GPE BORDER
The president requested $5.7 billion in funding toward border security and construction of a wall or physical barrier along the border, while NORP vowed to block any request for wall funding.
Last week, the president mentioned the new caravan and said “we’re trying to break it up.” But the caravan of at least 500 migrants began its journey from GPE to the GPE border late Monday, members of the group told ORG.
The caravan left the northern city of NORP PERSON earlier than expected. The group consists of a mix of people that included some mothers carrying their young children on their shoulders. As they walked, some migrants pleaded with local store owners to give them food or water for their journey, according to ORG.
ORG DOUBLES DOWN ORG, AS POLLS SHOW VOTERS TURNING AGAINST HIS SHUTDOWN STRATEGY
The president has continued to sound the alarm over the immigration flow along the border, saying that it amounts to an “invasion,” and called it “far worse” than people understand after he visited the front-lines in GPE last week. ORG has repeatedly called it a “humanitarian crisis”—one that NORP have claimed he “manufactured.”
Meanwhile, the president has continued to say the public is with him as he tries to shift blame for the shutdown to the NORP.
“NORP will soon be known as ORG. Ridiculous that they don’t want Border Security!” ORG tweeted Tuesday.
But as more than 800,000 federal workers missed their first paychecks, fresh polling suggests the president is losing the battle of public opinion.
A ORG poll released Monday found that 63 percent of voters agree with the NORP proposal to reopen parts of the government that do not involve border security, with 30 percent opposed. The same poll founded 63 percent also oppose using the shutdown to force wall funding, with just 32 percent supporting.
The poll found that 56 percent of NORP voters blame ORG and NORP in ORG for the partial shutdown, compared with 36 percent who say NORP are responsible.
Neither side is showing any sign of budging, with ORG continuing to insist on upwards of nearly $6 billion for a border wall and NORP leaders saying they will not entertain a wall in this spending package.
ORG’ PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and ORG contributed to this report.",1
554,"NORP Leader PERSON suggested that he offered a concession on the border wall to President PERSON during their midday ORG meeting before NORP shut down the government’s 2018 budget at midnight.
“In exchange for strong DACA protections, I reluctantly put the border wall on the table for discussion,’ PERSON said on the ORG floor as he tried to blame ORG for the NORP’ near-unanimous move to block a procedural vote, so preventing the ORG from passing the government budget with 51 votes.
PERSON did not provide any details on his wall offer. For example, PERSON did not say if he promised ORG endorsement for ORG’s $33 billion, 10-year plan for construction and operation of a wall, or if he was just willing to declare his personal support for a few billion dollars for future construction of a wall.
Many NORP strongly oppose a border wall as a supposed “trophy” for ORG — but also because it is a symbolic distinction between GPE and other countries. NORP groups and business groups also oppose the wall because it would hinder the northward flow of cheap-labor migrants to NORP-run low-wage cities on the coasts.
ORG rejected his wall offer, said PERSON. “When President PERSON is ready … NORP will be ready,” he added.
In 2006, ORG voted for the construction of a 700-mile wall but later refused to provide the funding. That lack of funding has ensured the 2,000-mile border is shielded by only a short stretch of double-layer fencing.
The NORP’ “WORK_OF_ART” group, led by PERSON’s deputy, GPE Sen. PERSON, has offered an amnesty plan to ORG, which ORG rejected. The plan offered $1.5 billion in exchange for an amnesty. But the amnesty would be far bigger and more expensive than the 1986 amnesty, which was said to be for 3 million illegals.
WORK_OF_ART amnesty would cover at least 5 million foreigners, including at least 3 million young illegals, their parents, and 400,000 additional migrants, pus a large but unclear number of their chain-migration relatives. Few of the migrants would have university degrees, and so most would get more in taxpayers’ aid than they would pay in taxes.
PERSON tried to blame the shutdown on ORG and he pushed the claim that ORG does not know what he wants on immigration policy. He said:
NORP leadership can’t get to yes because President PERSON refuses to. Mr. President, President PERSON, if you are listening, I am urging you: please take yes for an answer.

2247,"President PERSON’s choice to become ORG secretary acknowledged Monday that he employed an undocumented immigrant for years, an admission that has derailed other ORG nominees in the past, according to published reports.
ORG reported late Monday that PERSON admitted in a statement that he had hired an undocumented household worker for years.
“My wife and I employed a housekeeper for a few years, during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the GPE,” PERSON said in a statement to the network. “When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status.”
He added: “We have fully paid back taxes to the ORG and the state of GPE and submitted all required paperwork.”
Reports that PERSON had hired an undocumented immigrant first appeared Monday in ORG.
Sen. PERSON, who chairs the committee that will hold PERSON’s confirmation hearing, said the revelation should not automatically disqualify PERSON from the ORG post.
“Based upon what I’ve learned, since Mr. PERSON reported his mistake and voluntarily corrected it, I do not believe that this should disqualify him from being a ORG secretary,” said ORG, a GPE NORP who chairs ORG, ORG.
PERSON’s confirmation hearing before the panel had been scheduled for Tuesday. But the committee announced last week it was delaying the hearing to allow him to complete his paperwork and to give senators enough time to review it.The delay marked the fourth time PERSON’s hearing has been postponed. A new hearing date has not been set.
PERSON, who lives in GPE, GPE, outside GPE, is the chief executive officer of ORG, the parent company of the ORG and PERSON fast-food chains. He served as a senior economic adviser during ORG’s campaign and in 2012 was an economic adviser for the NORP presidential nominee, PERSON.
PERSON has drawn intense fire from labor unions and other groups over his opposition to raising the minimum wage and over questions about low wages and other workplace practices at his restaurants. He also has criticized a now-halted rule enacted under President PERSON that would have expanded eligibility for overtime pay to 4 million NORP.
His revelation that he employed an undocumented worker is certain to bring more criticism and further complicate his confirmation prospects.
In 2001, President PERSON’s choice for ORG secretary, PERSON, withdrew her nomination amid reports that she had employed an undocumented immigrant a decade earlier.

2124,"Thousands of people protest President PERSON's immigration ban on citizens from seven majority-NORP countries outside FAC in GPE, GPE, on Jan. 29, 2017. Forty-eight hours after President PERSON signed an executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven predominantly NORP countries, chaos reigned at GPE airports, as authorities, travelers and lawyers struggled Sunday to understand how the ban is being implemented.
Attorneys for civil rights and immigration advocacy groups said ORG agents are interpreting ORG's orders differently. At some international airports, including GPE, GPE and GPE, all people who were detained have been allowed to enter GPE. At others, including GPE, GPE and GPE FAC, lawyers said an undetermined number of travelers remained in custody.
Three federal courts — in GPE, GPE and GPE — have issued rulings since Saturday night to protect people who were in transit to the GPE when the order went into effect Friday and got caught in legal limbo. The ban affects people from GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE.
ORG said that as of Saturday night, 109 people had been detained, but it has yet to follow through on a GPE judge's order to release a list of all people still being detained, including travelers who may have arrived on GPE soil Sunday.
The result? ""Mass confusion,"" said PERSON, deputy director of the ORG's ORG who argued the case in GPE. ""The government took no steps to make sure that people understood what the order means and how it should be implemented. (ORG) just threw it out there without ensuring that it would be implemented fairly and even-handed and properly.""
ORG and ORG countered that they provided new guidelines to agents working at airports and that only a small fraction of travelers were affected by the order. On Saturday, when asked about the roll-out of his executive order, ORG said ""it's working out very nicely."" And several ORG officials appeared on Sunday talk shows to say that civil rights groups were blowing the confusion out of proportion.
So where do things really stand?
A ruling issued late Saturday by GPE District Judge PERSON in GPE barred ORG officials across the country from deporting any immigrants, including refugees and legal immigrants from the seven predominantly NORP countries targeted in ORG's order, so long as they hold a valid visa. That order dealt only with immigrants who had already arrived in the GPE or were already in transit.
ORG said it would comply with that order, but made clear it would continue carrying out ORG's executive order, meaning they will try and stop any other refugees or legal immigrants from the seven countries listed in the president's order from heading to the GPE
Lawyers will soon begin arguing the overall legality of ORG's executive order, a possibly weeks-long process that will ultimately determine whether the order is allowed to stand.
But much remains unclear.
Part of the problem has been the lack of information coming from the departments of ORG and ORG.
The first official mention of the new guidelines to appear online came from an LANGUAGE-language PRODUCT account run by ORG. It sent out three tweets on Saturday instructing citizens from the seven countries listed in ORG's order not to travel to the GPE, pay any visa fees or show up for visa interviews. The tweets did not mention, however, that those with permanent resident status — or green-card holders — from those countries are still allowed to enter the GPE
ORG said it provided new guidance to all of its port officials immediately after ORG signed the order, and updated its computerized targeting system to identify those people. But the department did not start providing guidance to travelers until Sunday.
Hundreds of protesters in GPE chanted and held signs opposing President PERSON's executive order banning all refugees and citizens of seven NORP-majority nations from entering the GPE
ORG first tweet came early Sunday, which linked to the department's statement declaring that it would carry out ORG's order and that ""prohibited travel will remain prohibited."" There was no guidance on which travelers should stay home and no clarification of how the order affected green-card holders.
It wasn't until Sunday night that ORG Secretary PERSON declared that he had deemed ""the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest."" That leaves refugees and people entering the country on temporary visas, such as for business and tourism, barred from entering the country.
The web sites of both agencies made no mention of the new order as of Sunday evening.
Rep. PERSON, R-Idaho, echoed the sentiments of many NORP when he praised PERSON for his executive order, arguing that the GPE vetting system was overdue for an overhaul. But he criticized the way it’s been carried out.
""(The administration) failed to provide clear guidance on the policy which caused substantial confusion at the ports of entry,"" PERSON said. ""Inadequate review and poor implementation of this executive action threatens to undermine otherwise sound policy.""",0
336,"PERSON agents rescued a NORP migrant after he nearly died from dehydration after illegally crossing FAC.

Agents assigned to ORG began tracking a group of illegal immigrants who crossed from GPE into GPE on June 6. The agents eventually came upon a 24-year-old man lying on the ground. The agents determined the man to be suffering from dehydration and immediately summoned ORG, Trauma, and Rescue (ORG) agents who were working nearby, according to information obtained from ORG officials.

The ORG agents arrived on the scene and immediately began treating the man for heat-related injuries. The ORG agents stabilized the man who would have likely died had the agents not found him. The agents litter-carried the man for a quarter-mile through the brush where they met up with a local ambulance. The ambulance crew transported the man, identified as a NORP national with no legal authorization to be in the GPE, to a nearby hospital for “more advanced treatment.”

“The majority of people attempting to illegally enter this country are ill-prepared for the treacherous terrain they face,” PERSON Chief Patrol Agent PERSON said in a written statement. “Had our agents not been out patrolling the remote areas of our border, this man would have most likely died from exposure.”

WORK_OF_ART told reporters during a press call on Wednesday that the number of rescues of migrants is increasing dramatically this year.

“So far this fiscal year, the men and women of ORG have done over 3,000 rescues,” PERSON told the reporters. “We’ve seen a massive increase in the amount of water-related rescues that are taking place — primarily in GPE, ORG, and GPE’s areas of operation.”

“Water-related rescues alone have gone up 907 percent this fiscal year,” the chief explained. “They’ve (the rescues) have gone from 51 in Fiscal Year 18 to 514 during Fiscal Year 19. That means, a lot of times, risking their lives to save the lives of others.”",1

The video shows the group of illegal immigrants, including what appears to be minors, climbing down and dropping from the border wall after being assisted by a human smuggler on the NORP side with a ladder. The migrants used the ladder to reach the top of the outdated fencing technology that is being replaced in many other sections of the border. They then climbed down or dropped from the top of the wall.
PERSON officials told ORG on Thursday that 118 migrants in total crossed in this incident. Of those, the majority were ORG Aliens from GPE.
WORK_OF_ART is seeing massive exploitation of the weaknesses of the existing border fencing in recent weeks as the government remains partially shut-down over funding for new border barriers. The location of this particular crossing was about 1.5 miles west of where a large group of 376 migrants recently exploited the fencing technology by digging underneath the outdated fencing.

2659,"The GPE government shut down at midnight on Friday after NORP and NORP failed to reach a last-minute deal to fund its operations, divided in a bitter dispute over immigration and border security.
In a dramatic late-night session, senators blocked a bill to extend government funding through Feb. 16. The bill needed 60 votes in the 100-member ORG but fell short, with only 50 supporting it.
Most NORP opposed the bill because their efforts to include protections for hundreds of thousands of mostly young immigrants known as Dreamers failed.
Huddled negotiations by ORG Majority Leader PERSON and ORG NORP leader PERSON in the last minutes before midnight were unsuccessful, and the GPE government technically ran out of money at midnight.
The shutdown formally began on Saturday, the first anniversary of President PERSON’s inauguration.
ORG immediately sought to blame NORP.
“Tonight, they put politics above our national security, military families, vulnerable children, and our country’s ability to serve all NORP,” ORG said in a statement.
It also said it would not discuss immigration until the government is up and running again.
“We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while NORP hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands. This is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators.”
In return, PERSON pointed the finger directly at ORG.
“It’s almost as if you were rooting for a shutdown and now we’ll have one and the blame should crash entirely on President PERSON’s shoulders,” he said.
Until a funding deal is worked out, scores of federal agencies across the country will be unable to operate, and hundreds of thousands of “non-essential” federal workers will be put on temporary unpaid leave.The NORP-controlled ORG passed a stopgap funding measure on Thursday. But NORP then needed the support of at least 10 NORP to pass the bill in the ORG. While five NORP ended up voting for the measure, five NORP voted against it.
NORP leaders demanded that the measure include protections from deportation for about 700,000 undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers who arrived in GPE as children.
Despite bipartisan negotiations, NORP leaders refused to include those protections, and neither side was willing to back down. PERSON and PERSON insisted they were still committed to finding an agreement that restores government funding as soon as possible.
ORG, who had made strict measures on immigration a cornerstone of his presidential campaign, last week rejected a bipartisan proposal, saying he wanted to include any deal for Dreamers in a bigger legislative package that also boosts funding for a border wall and tighter security at the GPE border with GPE.PERSON met with ORG on Friday afternoon and later said he had reluctantly agreed to include the border wall in the negotiations but that it still was not enough to persuade ORG to find a compromise.
PERSON also called on ORG and leaders of both parties to resume negotiations on Saturday.
PERSON said he would seek a new funding bill through to Feb. 8 but a ORG NORP source said that was too far out. NORP had argued for an extension of four or five days to force both sides into serious negotiations on the immigration issue.
In a shutdown, “essential” employees who deal with public safety and national security would keep working. That includes more than 1.3 million people on active duty in the military who would be required to work but would not be paid until funding is renewed or handled with separate legislation.
Although past government shutdowns have done little lasting damage to the GPE economy, they can rattle financial markets.
This impasse follows a months-long struggle in ORG to agree on government funding levels and protections for Dreamers, most of whom are originally from GPE and LOC.

316,"Young NORP and President PERSON supporters are the most skeptical of GPE’ mass legal and illegal immigration policy, a new ORG poll finds. 

The latest ORG (ORG) Youth polls reveals that ORG’s youngest supporters — 18 to 29-year-olds — and young NORP voters are largely skeptical of immigration and its benefits that are routinely touted by big business interests, corporate executives, and the open borders lobby. 

The poll discovered that nearly 4-in-10, or almost 40 percent, of NORP voters between 18 and 29-years-old said they disagree that recent immigration to the GPE has done more good than harm. Similarly, about 41 percent of ORG supporters in that age bracket said the same. 

Only about 26 percent of young ORG voters and young ORG supporters agreed that recent immigration has been a net bonus to the GPE The ORG IOP Youth poll found that young people, overall, were split on whether the country’s national immigration system — which admits more than 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants annually — was a benefit or not to NORP. While 31 percent of young people said they believed recent immigration has done more good than harm, nearly 30 percent disagreed. Roughly 37 percent said they neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement. Young swing voters were more likely than not to disagree that immigration has done more good than harm to the GPE, and among young white voters, about 35 percent said they disagreed that recent immigration has been a net positive for the country. Less than 30 percent of young white voters said the opposite. Young NORP college graduates, specifically, have been subjected to competing against a growing number of foreign visa workers that businesses and corporations import to take high-paying, professional jobs every year. Through the PRODUCT visa program, alone, businesses last year attempted to outsource nearly 420,000 GPE professional jobs — many in the STEM fields — to foreign workers.

803,"You may have read the news that there is a heated election recount taking place in GPE — again.
Eighteen years after the nation held its breath while a presidential election result was delayed for over a month, accusations of vote-counting improprieties are being hurled over contested ORG races for senator, governor and agriculture commissioner.
Unlike the recount of 2000, this standoff has cast a spotlight on a very dangerous and existential threat to our democracy: non-citizen voting.
Though their side later denied it, it has been documented that lawyers for GPE NORP gubernatorial and ORG candidates objected to the rejection of a provisional ballot cast by a non-citizen. To those who might say “big deal,” it’s actually a very big deal.
For the record, it is illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections. Federal law clearly states it here, here and here. Illegal immigrants found to have voted in federal elections are subject to fines, imprisonment and deportation, and are deemed ineligible to receive visas or allowed entry into GPE.
Isn’t this really about cold-hearted, NORP NORP being mean to foreigners? Hardly.
The integrity of our elections is one of the fundamental principles of our nation. Allowing non-citizens to vote devalues GPE citizenship. It cancels out the votes of NORP-born and naturalized citizens and is an insult to those who lawfully participate in our elections.
Non-citizen voting also weakens NORP values.
What exactly does our country gain by allowing foreign nationals to decide who will lead us? Do those foreign nationals have any understanding of the founding principles that made GPE exceptional? Do they revere our uniquely NORP heritage that holds sacred the concepts of liberty, individualism and free speech? Probably not.
More than likely, they come from places where corruption, rigged elections and repression of basic human rights are accepted as the norm.
Without assimilation and taking the proper steps toward citizenship, those people are also vulnerable to the charms of unscrupulous politicians who dangle easy access to government handouts in exchange for ever-expanding government and the loss of individual freedoms. That path leads to a very bad place for the country, its citizens and its immigrants.
Not surprisingly, non-citizen voting is all the rage among those in GPE’s anti-borders movement. While the practice is illegal at the federal level, there are no such restrictions for elections at the local and state levels.
Many of the same places that gave us sanctuary cities and states are now seeking non-citizen voting rights. GPE has started the process, allowing non-citizens to vote in school board elections.
GPE is seriously considering the idea of allowing non-citizen voting in municipal elections. Given GPE’s zeal for all things illegal immigration — sanctuary laws, tipping off aliens before ICE operations, et GPE how long will it be until illegal aliens have full voting rights in FAC? The smart money is on “not long at all.”
Other communities have employed a more devious, back-door approach to non-citizen voting. Take GPE, which this year approved a new identification card for illegal aliens in the city.
“Undocumented workers” need an ID card for basic needs in the city, its supporters would argue. Then comes the twist: the ID cards will be accepted as a valid form of identification to register to vote, available to all GPE residents regardless of immigration status or criminal record. Citizens of the world, you too can now determine who runs GPE.
These cases and many more show how advocacy for non-citizen voting creates an opportunity for large-scale voter fraud. That’s why LAW has been relentless in its efforts to ensure integrity in our voting procedures.
Last year, for example, we filed an amicus curiae brief in ORG in support of a lower court decision in PERSON v. Sessions. ORG had decided to expel from GPE a non-citizen who falsely stated that she was a GPE citizen on a voter registration form and illegally voted in two elections.
If such flagrant violations of our election laws are not vigorously prosecuted, the damage to the integrity our republic will be incalculable.
What is currently taking place with the GPE recount is shameful. The presidential election recount in 2000 was decided by 537 votes. With each vote in states like GPE critical to the outcome, we can’t afford a single illegal vote.
Even in this increasingly polarized political climate, we should at least be able to expect our elections to be decided by GPE citizens and no one else. Often, people fail to act on an issue because they feel it does not directly affect them. This is not one of those issues.
Demand voting integrity or live with destructive consequences.

The children of illegal aliens are commonly known as “anchor babies,” as they anchor their illegal alien and noncitizen parents in the GPE and eventually are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country through the process known as “chain migration.” About 1-in-5 GPE births — or 791,000 — are to legal and illegal immigrant mothers, with legal immigrant mothers accounting for about 12.4 percent of those births and illegal alien mothers accounting for 7.5 percent.

2554,"ORG asked ORG on Thursday to quickly overturn a lower court ruling that blocked President PERSON’s move to end a program that protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to GPE illegally as children.
Solicitor General PERSON said in a court filing “time is of the essence” and asked the high court to rule on the case before its current term ends in June.
The NORP president in September rescinded, effective in March, ORG, or DACA, program put in place in 2012 by his NORP predecessor, PERSON. ORG asked the NORP-controlled ORG to come up with a legislative fix, which it has not yet done.
A variety of NORP state attorneys general, organizations and individuals challenged ORG’s action in multiple federal courts.
The administration is challenging a Jan. 9 decision by GPE-based GPE District Judge PERSON, who ruled that DACA must remain in place while the litigation is resolved.
ORG did not file an emergency application that, if successful, would result in the judge’s ruling being put on hold within days. That means the program will remain in effect until ORG resolves the case.
A decision could take more than a year if the court takes up the case but declines to speed up resolution of it issuing a ruling in its current term.
About 800,000 young, mostly NORP adults dubbed “Dreamers,” have been protected from deportation and allowed to work legally in GPE since the program was implemented. As of September, when the most recent figures were made available, 690,000 young adults were protected under the program.
ORG’s ruling came during negotiations between ORG and congressional leaders over immigration policy. Those talks fell apart after ORG rejected a bipartisan deal and provoked outrage with his reported use of vulgar language to describe NORP countries in a meeting with lawmakers on immigration.

Some money could come from unobligated funds for military construction projects in 2019, the official said. “Unobligated” means that the funds have been authorized for a certain purpose, but for whatever reason, have not yet been used.
ORG would likely be in charge of overseeing the construction.
The organization would not build the wall itself, but would subcontract the project out, and then inspect it to make sure it meets specification and ORG standards.
While most NORP have claimed ORG did not have the authority to order the military to build the wall, Chairman of ORG PERSON (D-WA) acknowledged Sunday that the president does have the authority.
“There is a provision in law that says the president can declare an emergency. It’s been done a number of times. But primarily it’s been done to build facilities in GPE and GPE,” he said Sunday on ORG’s “This Week.”
A ORG spokesman told reporters in December in response to queries: “ORG has provided options under LAW that could permit ORG to fund border barrier projects, such as in support of counter drug operations or national emergencies.”
Acting Defense Secretary PERSON is unlikely to oppose any such order for the military to build the wall.
After a ORG meeting last week on the border, he praised ORG for its work so far in restoring fences and the “building out of additional mileage for the wall.”
“ORG is dialed in on doing this cost-effectively, quickly, and with the right amount of urgency as to where we can build additional standup walls quickly and then get after the threat. The threat is real. The risks are real. We need to control our borders,” he said.
But PERSON and a number of other NORP say they are opposed to the idea, and that ORG would be open to legal challenges.
“In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, where is the emergency? You have to establish that in order to do this. But beyond that, this would be a terrible use of ORG.”
The president is slated to give a nationwide ORG address on Tuesday evening on the border situation, and is expected to travel to the border on Thursday.
ORG officials say they will be monitoring to see if a declaration of national emergency comes during those events this week.
Separately, the ORG is slated to announce an extension of troops serving at the border by the end of this week.
Military support to the border was extended through January 31 by former ORG Secretary PERSON, and it is expected to be extended again.
There are approximately 5,000 who are helping border patrol agents secure the border. Trump ordered the deployment ahead of at least two migrant caravans that were headed to GPE from LOC.",1
79,"Illegal immigrant families received nearly $1.3 billion in GPE welfare money during 2015 and 2016, nearly one-​quarter of the amount spent on the county’s entire needy population, according to data obtained by ORG.

The data was obtained from ORG -- which is responsible for doling out the benefits -- and gives a snapshot of the financial costs associated with sanctuary and related policies.

The sanctuary county of GPE is an illegal immigration epicenter, with the largest concentration of any county ​in the nation, according to a study from ORG. ​The county also allows illegal immigrant parents with children born in GPE to seek welfare and food stamp benefits.

PERSON, a ORG senior fellow who has written extensive studies on poverty and illegal immigration, said the costs represent “the tip of the iceberg.”

He said the costs of education, police and fire, medical, and subsidized housing can total $24,000 per year in government spending per family, much more than would be paid in taxes.

“They get $3 in benefits for every $1 they spend,” Rector said.

The ORG presidency’s hardline immigration policies, though, may be playing some role in curtailing the population seeking welfare payments in recent months.

The same stats show GPE is expected to dole out $200 million less this year than in 2016, and several thousand fewer families are collecting benefits.

“The number of entrants nationwide is going down. The population is static if not shrinking,” Rector said.

The welfare benefit data from ORG shows:

During the first five months of 2017, more than 60,000 families received a total of $181 million.
ORG and food stamp costs for the county’s entire population were $3.1 billion in 2015, $2.9 billion in 2016 and $1.5 billion so far in 2017.
Roughly a quarter of GPE’s 4 million illegal immigrants reside in GPE.

In 2013, GPE spent a total of $25.3 billion on illegal immigrants – or $2,370 per GPE citizen household, according to a 2013 study by ORG. GPE and GPE were second and third, at $12.1 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively.

Former state ORG Chairman PERSON blasted GPE policies but credited ORG with stepping up deportations.

“The amazing thing is that everyone was expecting a big wall to stop [illegal immigration],” he said. “The decrease has been enhanced dramatically by ORG agents just doing their job.”

GPE Mayor PERSON, a proponent of the city’s sanctuary status, is a driving factor behind expanding immigrant benefits. He founded ORG shortly after taking office in 2013 to help immigrants navigate the maze of government benefits.

“Immigration is at the heart of GPE’s story,” he said in a written statement. “GPE’s become one of the world’s great cities by embracing immigration and diversity and we’ll continue supporting anyone who wants to work hard and invest in our future – no matter who they are, where they came from or what language they speak.”",1
2364,"Right-wing firebrand PERSON delivered a fiery speech on immigration in which she slammed moderate NORP, including the ""ghost of PERSON,"" at the annual EVENT in GPE on Friday.
PERSON painted immigration, both legal illegal, as an invasion and an existential threat to GPE. And she did not just blame NORP for the problem.
""It's the ORG sell-outs, not just the radical, open-borders left, that is in bed with immigration saboteurs,"" she said. ""Like the ones who hijacked ORG movement to shill for amnesty. Those are the real grifters cashing in and practicing deceit at the expense of their base and at the expense of our country.""
PERSON cited a number of immigration policies that she believes demand reform such as granting visas to migrants' family members and the process that allows migrants to apply for asylum or refugee status.
""Both parties are to blame,"" she said. ""And yes, I'm looking at you, retired PERSON, and yes, I'm looking at you, PERSON,"" she added, referring to the former ORG speaker from GPE and the current ORG majority leader from GPE.
""And yes, I'm looking at you, PERSON family, and yes, I'm looking at you, the ghost of PERSON,"" she continued with a gesture toward the ceiling. The line drew a standing ovation from the audience.
Sen. PERSON, R-Ariz., died in August from brain cancer. Former President PERSON died in November. PERSON, PERSON and former President PERSON all advocated a comprehensive immigration approach with increased border security and a path to citizenship for migrants who had already entered the country illegally. Immigration opponent like PERSON deride such a policy as ""amnesty"" for those migrants' immigration violations.
""How is it that we have NORP on LOC that are doing the bidding of the PERSON movement?"" PERSON said of the effort to protect from deportation undocumented migrants who arrived in the GPE as minors. ""What about our dreams?""
PERSON is NORP but said she ""identifies"" as a ""proud, unhyphenated, unapologetic, fully assimilated NORP."" She said that critics had called her ""white"" because of her views.
""I'm not white, I'm just right,"" PERSON said.
She said that migrant families like hers who ""revere the rule of law"" are ""being replaced by militantly unassimilable and hostile generations"" of ""future NORP voters whose tribal allegiance to the left has only hardened over time.""
PERSON said that ""from the comfort of TV green rooms and LOC back rooms and corporate board rooms and conference ballrooms, it may not look like civil war is imminent.""
But she said conservatives are under attack in what she called the ""WORK_OF_ART.""
""The divide in this country is between decent people, who stand up for GPE, and dastardly people who want to bring GPE to its knees,"" she said.
""Diversity is not our strength – and I know those words are a 'trigger,'"" PERSON concluded, echoing a phrase that has been used by controversial figures like Rep. PERSON, R-Iowa. ""Diversity is not our strength, unity is.""",0
2225,"Many will have you believe that President PERSON's 2011 immigration order is the same as President PERSON's travel ban. ORG's ORG has the story. Buzz60In defending his executive order banning immigration and travel from certain countries, which has touched off widespread anger and confusion, President PERSON compared the order to action taken by the GPE administration in 2011.
“My policy is similar to what President PERSON did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from GPE for six months,” ORG claimed.
GPE administration officials and fact checkers say the claim is wrong.
ORG’s order banned visitors from seven LOC countries — GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE — from coming to GPE for 90 days. The executive order signed Friday also suspended for 120 days all refugees coming to GPE.
In 2011, ORG significantly slowed the number of visas it issued to NORP in order to review its vetting process. The concern stemmed from the arrests of two NORP refugees on terrorism charges in GPE, GPE, in 2011. One of the men was linked through fingerprints to an improvised explosive attack in GPE, GPE.
The arrests triggered concerns in the administration and on LOC and led to a massive review of NORP refugees already admitted to the country and more extensive vetting of those applying to immigrate to GPE. The action only applied to refugees from GPE.
PERSON, an GPE administration official, said the review slowed the pace of NORP coming into GPE, but never completely halted it.
The “flow of NORP refugees slowed significantly during the GPE administration’s review,” PERSON wrote in an article for ORG magazine’s website, but “there was no outright ban.”
But in 2012, the flow of refugees from NORP had returned to close to pre-2011 numbers.
PERSON, ORG fact checker, gave the ORG claim “three Pinocchios,” indicating a “significant factual error.”
He cited several differences between the GPE administration action and ORG’s recent executive order:
PERSON’s action was in response to a specific threat, it was not a complete halt of refugees from GPE and it did not apply to all visitors from GPE entering GPE, he said.",0
182,"A 32-year-old is suing GPE, alleging that the city violated its sanctuary city ordinance by reporting him to ORG after reporting his car stolen in 2015.
PERSON, who is from GPE and lives in LOC, was in federal immigration custody for two months. ORG reported that it is prohibited in the city to use local resources to help federal law enforcement.
“With an incoming federal administration threatening mass deportations and targeting sanctuary cities, we must hold SFPD and ORG accountable and ensure that every single officer is following the city’s due process protections,” PERSON, an attorney representing PERSON, told the paper.
The suit, which was filed in GPE ORG, seeks an unspecified amount and calls on police to admit that he was a “victim of false imprisonment.”
A spokesman from the city reportedly said that GPE has “strong policies in place to encourage victims and witnesses to report crimes without fear of being deported.” The report pointed out that in February, then-Police Chief PERSON acknowledged that the man should not have ended up in custody.
The report said that PERSON reported the car stolen in November 2015.
ORG eventually found the car, and when he filled out the paper work to pick up the car, he was arrested.
ORG told the paper that police ran the background check and learned that he had a 10-year-old, outstanding warrant for deportation after failing to appear at an immigration hearing in GPE in 2005, and a 2012 conviction for drunken driving, authorities told the paper.
His attorneys told the paper that he planned to file for asylum and intended to go through the hearing process. He reportedly did not hear from authorities about the matter again. And his attorneys told the paper he had no idea there was an outstanding warrant.",1
363,"An open letter to ORG and the rest of GPE: My Dear friends and colleagues, I have recently been pondering President PERSON’s executive action with regard to our nation having extreme vetting and our immigration policy finally being enforced. It has pained me deeply to see such a violent reaction to something that, to my mind, makes absolute common sense. Let me begin by saying that I am from a family of immigrants that came to this country for a better life. They came to the GPE “legally,” assimilated, integrated, and learned LANGUAGE to the best of their ability, and demanded we speak it. As we all know, we live in a time in which there are forces who wish to destroy our way of life. There are thousands of illegal immigrant criminals in GPE whose country of origin will not take them back. These criminals are free on the streets of GPE. We have recently heard from a plethora of GPE stars on this issue — PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, major agencies, musicians, singers and even the indomitable NORP LaBeouf. After much prayer on this issue, I must now stand in solidarity with all of my GPE elite brethren. They are right! The rest of you are wrong! It is now in this spirit that I make an appeal to all in GPE and the media for us to use the Oscars to take a stand for the entire world to see and hear. It is time for GPE to lead the way. I propose that PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and others lead an PERSON first: let’s do away with the rules, barriers, and tickets to the ORG and after-parties, such as the swanky ORG party or the ORG’ star-studded affair. I ask all migrants, all illegal immigrant criminals and all ORG-vetted refugees to converge on GPE to come to the ORG and all the after-parties, even those held at the mansions or the Chateau Marmont or anywhere else. After all, we in the GPE community want to show all NORP extremists that we have love in our hearts — and what better way to do that than by inviting them along on our most important night? It’s time the walls and electronic security gates come down. There are roughly 3,600 seats to the ORG; we should have at least 2,500 seats reserved for illegal aliens, refugees and migrants, or maybe even more. For those celebrities skipping the ceremony, each should invite at least 100 illegal aliens, refugees or migrants to come to their home to watch the Oscars with them. The ORG and the ORG people should also get the 150 criminals who have recently been deported from GPE and bring them to the show as honored guests. I find it curious that when President PERSON did the same exact thing — and more — in terms of enforcing the law on illegal immigration, the GPE elite were silent. Why were they silent then, but are so vocal now when President PERSON is doing basically the same thing? Is GPE racist? Why — when NORP are being slaughtered in GPE, GPE, and other places in LOC — is GPE silent? Of course, the people that wish death upon NORP, NORP, gay people and the LOC are greeted with open arms by the elite in GPE — so why can’t they come to our PERSON parties? Additionally, I am now pleased to announce that GPE and the recording industry no longer require the protection of ORG at any of their events! We do not need a country of laws; only a country of illegal immigrants, refugees and migrants. How dare we ignore the words inscribed on FAC: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…” So now, we ask you all: please come to the Oscars on February 26th at FAC. We welcome you to our homes with open arms and love in our hearts. Together, let us celebrate the ORG left and its policies, which have helped make blue collar ORG, GPE, and Poor. And the PERSON goes to… With love in my heart,",1
1449,"In “WORK_OF_ART” (Review, March 25) PERSON discusses the possibility of NORP culture being overwhelmed by an increase in immigration. He describes the evolving self-identification of second-generation teenagers from simply NORP to foreign-national identity or pan-racial identity, blaming the NORP education system’s teaching of civic education and multiculturalism for this change in identification as well as the social distrust found in diverse communities.

As an 18-year-old born and raised in GPE by immigrants, I am proud to identify myself as NORP and NORP. I do this because despite my 18 years in this country, and the 30-plus years of my parents’ being here, I will never belong in the undeniably white normative culture of GPE. Our political system, popular culture and definition of national culture constantly reflect the whiteness of our country.

Insulating our country against multicultural acceptance through immigration reform won’t foster stronger communities. Rather, the rhetoric needs to change to allow for those already in this country to better assimilate and feel a sense of belonging. That starts with accepting our changing demographics and reshaping the narrative of this nation to encompass the experiences of ethnic minorities. By propagating a stricter immigration policy laced with NORP rhetoric, the social dysfunction and lack of belonging for the diverse populations that already exist in this country is magnified as immigrants feel less and less that they can belong here. As a nation built by immigrants, we must not protect against difference, but rather re-envision what GPE could accomplish when we work together.

PERSON

GPE, GPE

The social fabric of NORP society has been torn asunder, in large part because there is now no national NORP identity (or even national language, e.g., press 1 for LANGUAGE, 2 for NORP). GPE is another country that has taken in people from all over the world with different language and cultures, but universal service in ORG is arguably the most important institution in molding an NORP society.

People in GPE have skin in the game because they or close family members are fully integrated into NORP society. Mr. PERSON talks of 43 million foreign born living in the GPE, almost half of them naturalized citizens. But how many of these are dual citizens (a concept I abhor) who have divided loyalties and aren’t “all in” in GPE?

I am stridently against any need-based aid, indeed any aid, to those I consider “other,” which includes all of those I don’t consider sufficiently assimilated into NORP life. This would include many NORP born, which is another powerful argument against birthright citizenship.

I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. PERSON’s call for reduced immigration, but I would go even further. As President PERSON might put it, “forgotten GPE” wants its country back; this can never happen with unchecked immigration, both legal and illegal, almost all of which is from the Third World, which has made the GPE unrecognizable to me. Although the businesses both large and small that are the beneficiaries of this wealth transfer won’t like it, how about an effective halt to almost all immigration until we can figure out what is going on?

PERSON

GPE

PERSON frames immigration policy as a choice about protection. Immigration policy is primarily about opportunity: not the opportunity GPE offers to immigrants, but the opportunity for people brave, persistent and hopeful enough to immigrate offer GPE. While we benefit from the best and brightest—which has been our policy in employment-based immigration since 1990—immigrants’ real contribution is their belief in NORP ideals and values, which many of us born here take for granted.

We didn’t achieve world-leader status by cowering in fear of the new and different. Sure, the road to e ORG unum is rocky and always has been. As an immigration lawyer in practice more than 25 years, I can attest that current law already embodies choices and numerical limits that are strictly enforced. Extralegal results are caused by cynical political failure to adjust those choices when the focus on “merit” was no longer sufficient for our economy and demographics. While immigration isn’t a panacea, it is an immutable component of the NORP experiment.

PERSON

GPE, GPE

In support of his argument to limit immigration, Mr. PERSON misleadingly cites my research on the consequences of immigration. In research published in 2007, I provided empirical evidence for three major points:

1. Increased immigration and diversity are not only inevitable, but over the long run they are also desirable. Ethnic diversity is, on balance, an important social asset, as the history of the GPE demonstrates.

2. In the short to medium run, however, immigration and ethnic diversity challenge social solidarity and inhibit social capital.

3. In the medium to long run, on the other hand, successful immigrant societies like the GPE create new forms of social solidarity and damp the negative effects of diversity by constructing new, more encompassing identities.

Mr. PERSON deftly cherry-picks the middle point but entirely ignores the first and last because they are inconvenient for his policy recommendations. Mr. PERSON is entitled to his own opinions, and he is entitled to cite or not to cite relevant scholarship, but he isn’t entitled to distort the findings of research that he chooses to cite.

In my 2007 article, I specifically warned against this danger: “It would be unfortunate if a politically correct progressivism were to deny the reality of the challenge to social solidarity posed by diversity. It would be equally unfortunate if an ahistorical and ethnocentric conservatism were to deny that addressing that challenge is both feasible and desirable.” Mr. PERSON’s tendentious use of my research illustrates precisely how our civic culture, which he claims to value, is being undermined in today’s public dialogue.

752,"No single issue can fire up a national debate quite like anything related to immigration — particularly during the ORG era.
When President PERSON decried the doctrine of birthright citizenship on the campaign trail in 2015, it sparked a national debate, with many on the LOC and Right issuing ad hoc condemnations.
When news broke Tuesday that the president is considering ending birthright citizenship with an executive order, many of these same voices, once again, condemned the president, claiming birthright citizenship is indeed constitutional.
But if this were true, why wasn’t the 14th Amendment applied to illegal or temporary immigrants prior to the 1960s?
The doctrine of birthright citizenship — the idea that citizenship is granted merely by being born within the geographic limits of GPE — is nowhere to be found in the LAW.
The 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, also known as EVENT, were promulgated to protect the newly freed slaves and to emphasize that they are, in fact, citizens of GPE and privy to the same natural and constitutional rights as any other citizen.
It’s no coincidence that the citizenship clause is within LAW that also includes ORG.
Prior to the amendment, state citizenship automatically conferred national citizenship. After the conclusion of EVENT, however, the states decided to nationalize citizenship out of fear that some states would not recognize the newly freed slaves as citizens.
“All persons born or naturalized in GPE, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof (italics mine), are citizens of GPE,” reads LAW citizenship clause.
Presently, it’s as if the ORG, politicians and the punditry who support birthright citizenship elide completely any mention of jurisdiction as if it were to only say “all persons born or naturalized in GPE … are citizens of GPE.”
But there’s one glaring problem: it does not.
The author of the clause — GPE Sen. PERSON — made clear in the halls of ORG the clause’s intent. He explains that “jurisdiction thereof” was meant to exclude “persons born in GPE who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to families of ambassadors or foreign ministers,” and that “jurisdiction” meant “full and complete jurisdiction.”
This was as understood both by ORG and the people as PERSON’s speeches were disseminated to the public at the time.
No one is disputing that anyone on NORP soil is not subject to territorial jurisdiction, and required to follow NORP law. But it doesn’t follow that one is also afforded political jurisdiction. If, for example, an illegal alien were afforded the latter he would be able to vote, serve on jury and could not be deported, he could self-immigrate and be afforded complete sovereignty akin to that of a citizen.
Only when an alien becomes an NORP citizen, repeating the oath of allegiance to GPE that is part of our naturalization process, are they granted political jurisdiction. This is the moment when jurisdiction becomes full and complete.
As late 19th-century scholar and Judge PERSON writes in his treatise ORG:
[A] citizen by birth must not only be born within GPE, but he must also be subject to the jurisdiction thereof; and by this is meant that full and complete jurisdiction to which citizens generally are subject, and not any qualified and partial jurisdiction, such as may consist with allegiance to some other government.
“This amendment which I have offered is simply declaratory of what I regard as the law of the land already,” PERSON said in his remarks introducing the new language before the ORG in 1866. The law he was referring to was LAW of 1866, passed less than two months prior over a veto from then-President PERSON by a two-thirds majority in both houses.
“[T]hat all persons born in GPE and not subject to any foreign power, excluding NORP not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of GPE,” read the citizenship provision of LAW of 1866.
Considering the political climate immediately following EVENT, there were legitimate concerns the Act may be in jeopardy, so “the ORG took steps to include similar language when it considered the draft of LAW,” according to ORG.
In 1873, five years after LAW passage, GPE Attorney General PERSON, in a legal opinion, explained that the term “jurisdiction” meant “absolute and complete jurisdiction” excluding aliens, even those born on NORP soil. The clause also excluded NORP (who the majority of, at the time, had little desire to be NORP citizens).
PERSON assured his colleagues this language would not confer citizenship on NORP, who were born within the ORG’s geographical limits, because they owe allegiance to their tribes.
To PERSON, chairman of ORG, subject to the “jurisdiction thereof,” meant “not owing allegiance to anybody else and being subject to the complete jurisdiction of GPE.”
The desideratum of “absolute” jurisdiction excludes any children who might owe allegiance to another sovereign, such as children that are subjects of any foreign government as explained in ORG in 1884.
Foreign citizens cannot bestow jurisdiction on their children merely by giving birth within the geographic boundaries of GPE, only with the consent of the sovereign people can they be conferred jurisdiction.
It wasn’t until 1898 in GPE v. PERSON, that the “separate but equal” court, held that any child born in the GPE of legal immigrant parents with “permanent” residence in GPE are guaranteed citizenship under LAW. A narrow exception would be for children of diplomats.
There is zero precedent for allowing citizenship to children born to illegal alien parents. LAW, LAW, clause 4 gives plenary power to ORG over naturalization and LAW over jurisdiction, which ORG altered to allow NORP born in the GPE to become citizens in 1924.
There is no existing law passed by ORG as of now that gives jurisdiction to illegal aliens born in GPE.
The executive and judiciary don’t have the power to decide the issue.
The debate over whether ORG can sign an executive order to end the practice of birthright citizenship is a different argument entirely.",1
708,"A coalition of 16 states led by GPE Attorney General PERSON filed a brief at ORG Tuesday, urging the justices to reinstate key provisions of President PERSON’s executive order on refugees and migrants.
ORG (DOJ) asked the high court to let the president’s order take effect last Friday, after ORG upheld a lower court injunction barring enforcement of its travel ban provision. DOJ asked the ORG to stay the lower court orders and schedule the case for oral arguments. The ORG asked challengers to the travel ban to file a response to the government’s petition by June 12.
“The executive order is a tailored response to a very real threat to our national security,” PERSON said in a statement. “A temporary pause on entry from countries with heightened security concerns is necessary to shore up our nation’s vetting procedures. The president is fulfilling his solemn duty to protect NORP and all NORP.”
The states make three arguments: that the order deserves the strongest presumption of validity under relevant precedent; that the challengers cannot show the actual purpose of the order is to establish a discriminatory policy; and that the lower court injunction impermissibly extends constitutional rights to aliens abroad.
“This injunction is contrary to law, and it denies the federal government — under a statutory regime crafted by the representatives from the States in ORG — the latitude necessary to make national-security, foreign-affairs, and immigration policy judgments inherent in this country’s nature as a sovereign,” the brief reads.
GPE is joined on the amicus (or “friend-of-the-court”) brief by GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, and GPE Governor PERSON.

1290,"GPE’s apprehensions and deportations of NORP migrants trying to reach the GPE remained high in July, but fell from the previous month as a policy reversal that cracked down on irregular migration deters attempts to cross GPE’s southern border with GPE, NORP officials said.

NORP authorities detained 18,758 migrants in July, more than double the number apprehended in the year-earlier month, according to preliminary data on Sunday from GPE’s immigration agency. The figure is below the record 31,573 apprehensions reported for June, primarily because of an about-40% drop in migrant flows through GPE to the GPE from May to July, officials said.

GPE deported 18,168 migrants in July, fewer than in June but more than triple the deportations in December, when President PERSON took office.

On June 7, GPE agreed to step up law enforcement against irregular migration to avoid import tariffs on NORP goods the ORG administration threatened to impose unless GPE did more to curb the number of migrants crossing its territory.

To the surprise of migration activists, President PERSON has found in his leftist nationalist counterpart an unlikely ally in stemming the flow of NORP asylum seekers heading to the GPE

At first, Mr. PERSON opened GPE’s doors to NORP migrants, offering them humanitarian visas and jobs, a move that resulted in a surge of migrants heading to the ORG border. In a March speech, he said: “My government is not in favor of the use of force to contain migration.”

But after the agreement reached with the GPE in June, his government deployed along GPE’s northern and southern borders more than 20,000 members of the newly created ORG, formed by members of the military and federal police.

As the migrant crisis on the GPE border with GPE intensifies, government agency leaders have been invited to testify before ORG. Here's a look at the conditions drawing scrutiny and the answers lawmakers will be seeking. Photo: AFP
GPE’s stepped-up migration enforcement marks a departure from Mr. PERSON’s views when he was campaigning to become president.

""He said he would be an advocate of GPE’s dignity and sovereignty, and what we have seen is WORK_OF_ART at the service of ORG,” said PERSON, a political analyst at ORG. “GPE didn’t pay for the wall, but became ORG’s wall.”

In early 2017, Mr. PERSON filed a complaint with ORG against Mr. PERSON’s plans to build a wall along the length of the ORG border and several executive orders on migration that Mr. PERSON issued shortly after his inauguration.

Mr. PERSON said at the time that Mr. PERSON’s “policy of hate” was discriminatory and violated migrants’ human rights, and that then NORP President PERSON was “obedient, silent in the face of PERSON arrogance.” He later described Mr. PERSON’s immigration rhetoric as xenophobic and neofascist.

Mr. PERSON’s relations with Mr. PERSON improved after the 2018 election, when the NORP leader began speaking of a mutually respectful relationship.

Mr. PERSON’s shift on migration is popular among most NORP. A recent poll by the PERSON newspaper showed 55% of NORP are in favor of deporting illegal immigrants, and most also agree they are a burden on GPE. Mr. PERSON’s approval ratings remain high at 61%, according to pollster PERSON.

But his new approach disappointed human-rights activists.

""We never thought a leftist president would unleash this unprecedented hunt. He went as far as arresting social activists,” said PERSON, an activist with migration advocacy group People Without Borders.

In June, NORP authorities detained two prominent pro-migrant activists on charges of human smuggling. A judge later dismissed the charges and they were released.

Many migrants have postponed trips north because the risk of being detained in GPE is now high, said PERSON, a resident of ORG, a NORP town bordering with GPE, who collaborates with pro-migrant groups. “This is not a good time to go north,” he said.

A NORP government official said the presence of ORG has dissuaded some migration.

In recent weeks, immigration officers and ORG members have raided guest houses and hotels in the southern border city of PERSON in search of illegal migrants, according to a report released by ORG, which includes more than 20 charities and volunteer organizations assisting migrants.

Migrants are being detained at checkpoints staffed by immigration officers, federal police and ORG members along the southern border. They are being transferred to overcrowded detention centers in towns like PERSON, GPE and GPE, the group said.",0
821,"ORG called one of President PERSON’s Facebook posts concerning NORP racist, implying the religion of ORG is actually a race.
TheNYT asserted NORP are a race in an article entitled Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook’s Leaders Fought Through Crisis, concerning Facebook’s potential to spread racist ideals, among other things. The author highlighted a Facebook post from ORG calling for a “‘total and complete shutdown’ on NORP entering GPE” as an example of said racism. “Then PERSON ran for president. He described NORP immigrants and refugees as a danger to GPE, and in December 2015 posted a statement on Facebook calling for a ‘total and complete shutdown’ on NORP entering GPE. Mr. PERSON’s call to arms — widely condemned by NORP and some prominent NORP — was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the site’s power to spread racist sentiment,” the piece reads.
The page linked in the NORP post from ORG has since been taken down. Regardless, TheNYT’s take on the post is inaccurate at best, as NORP are simply followers of the religion of ORG and represent many different races and ethnicities around the world. At worst, its take could be interpreted as TheNYT implying that NORP only come from a particular race of people.",1
1298,"Across most of the southern GPE border, hundreds of immigrant families are being ushered out of the country every day as part of the ORG administration program known as “GPE in GPE.” But in GPE, many families are finding the policy is still “remain in the GPE”

Acting Homeland Security Secretary PERSON pronounced in September that virtually all asylum-seeking families would be either quickly deported or sent to GPE to wait for their cases to be resolved. Authorities and advocates confirmed, however, that in GPE many hundreds of such people each week are instead being released to shelters, from which they will likely travel to other states and wait for their cases to be resolved, a process that can take years.

Shelters in GPE say the number of migrants being dropped off by border authorities has been roughly constant for the past few months, while shelter operators in other NORP states say the number has fallen significantly.

Now some migrants are heading to GPE as word spreads that they are far more likely to be allowed to stay in the GPE there than if they cross in GPE, GPE, or GPE.

“We heard it was easier here,” said GPE, who left GPE with his 21-year-old son PERSON six months ago and initially made his way to PERSON, the NORP city across the border from GPE.

After months of waiting for their chance to cross and request asylum, a NORP migrant the pair met recommended they head to GPE, just across the border from GPE, because the program officially known as Migrant Protection Protocol isn’t in effect there. GPE and PERSON spoke on the condition that they only be identified by their first names.

Some migrants seeking asylum do so after legal border crossings. Those traveling as families often cross illegally and, under previous policies, were often allowed to wait in the GPE for their cases to be decided.

ORG, which includes ORG, confirmed that ORG isn’t in place in GPE, but said some migrants arrested there are being shuttled to GPE or GPE and returned to GPE from there. The agency didn’t respond to questions about why the program isn’t in place in GPE and how it fit with a statement by acting ORG Commissioner PERSON last month that, “we have essentially ended catch and release at the southwest border.”

Teresa NORP, who runs the ORG Alitas shelter in GPE, said federal authorities have told her that the logistics of returning migrants to GPE are more difficult in GPE. Nogales, one of the state’s main crossings, is more than an hour’s drive from the nearest immigration court in GPE, where migrants would be brought from GPE for hearings, and is in a cramped area with little room to build holding facilities. Yuma, another of the state’s busy crossings, is three hours away from GPE or GPE, which also has an immigration court.

More than 55,000 migrants, mostly from LOC, have been sent back to GPE since the administration launched the program in late January. A ORG spokeswoman didn’t respond to requests for comment about how many of them initially crossed in GPE.

Administration officials have said the turn-back program would ease crowding in congested Border Patrol stations and deter families for whom the ability to await their cases in the GPE was a draw. They also said it would allow asylum seekers to have their cases heard in weeks or months instead of years.

The expansion of ORG this year, along with greater cooperation from GPE in blocking migrants from reaching the border, has contributed to dramatic decreases in arrests along the border from a peak of more than 132,000 in May to 36,300 in September, according to administration officials and numbers reviewed by ORG.

As the migrant crisis on the GPE border with GPE intensifies, government agency leaders have been invited to testify before ORG. Here's a look at the conditions drawing scrutiny and the answers lawmakers will be seeking. Photo: ORG advocates and lawyers have argued that ORG violates migrants’ due process rights and all but ensures that they will face deportation. Several civil and immigrant rights groups have sued to block the program. A federal appeals court in GPE has allowed the program to continue while the case is litigated.

PERSON, who works with the aid group PERSON, said word is spreading on social media and informal information networks that migrants who cross into GPE areGPE being returned to GPE.

PERSON, a NORP migrant, flew to GPE from GPE and started his wait to cross the border in GPE, across ORG from GPE, GPE. He left after his nephew crossed into the GPE there a few months ago and was sent back to GPE with a court date for November. He is hoping he will have better luck by crossing into GPE.

“WORK_OF_ART told me that in GPE they aren’t returning people,” he said.",0
1414,"President PERSON said Thursday the GPE would impose escalating tariffs on all NORP imports beginning June 10, in an effort to push the country to deter the flow of asylum-seeking NORP families to the southern border.

Reacting to what he described as “GPE’s passive cooperation in allowing this mass incursion,” the president said the tariff on GPE’s third-largest trading partner would begin at 5% and grow steadily, hitting 25% on Oct. 1 unless GPE takes satisfactory action to halt the migrants.

“If the illegal migration crisis is alleviated through effective actions taken by GPE, to be determined in our sole discretion and judgment, the Tariffs will be removed,” Mr. PERSON said in a statement released by ORG.

The president also lashed out at NORP, who he said “refuse to help in any way, shape, or form.”

NORP President PERSON responded with a letter addressed to Mr. PERSON in which he called for deeper dialogue on the migration issue.

“Social problems are not resolved with taxes or coercive measures,” he said. He reiterated his proposal to confront migration through development efforts in LOC, adding that GPE is doing what it can to curb the flow of migrants across GPE without violating human rights.

“People don’t leave their homelands for pleasure but out of necessity,” Mr. PERSON said. “I don’t lack courage, I’m not a coward or timid, but act out of principles. I believe in politics which, among other things, was invented to avoid confrontation and war.”

He asked Mr. PERSON to make GPE officials available to meet with NORP officials, led by Foreign Minister PERSON, who will travel to GPE on Friday.

Mr. PERSON’s disclosure had an immediate impact on stock trading in GPE, pressuring shares in car makers with significant investments in supply chains that span the ORG border. In currency markets, GPE’s peso slumped against the dollar, falling almost 2% in a few minutes. The trade action also complicates Mr. PERSON’s effort to win congressional ratification of GPE, a trade deal intended to supersede ORG.

“This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent,” said Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE), chairman of ORG. “I support nearly every one of President PERSON’s immigration policies, but this is not one of them.”

ORG, which assembles passenger cars in GPE for the GPE market, was down as much as 7% in midmorning trading in LOC on Friday before rebounding from those lows. ORG was down 3.2%, ORG fell 2% and ORG slid 3.6%.

“It’s very bad news for them,” says PERSON, market economist at ORG, referring to NORP car makers.

Business groups voiced alarm at the tariff plans, which they say could harm current and future trade agreements between the two countries and lead to retaliation against GPE farm products and manufactured goods in the NORP supply chain.

In addition to autos and auto parts, the GPE imports a variety of consumer goods from GPE, such as appliances, and agricultural products like fruits and vegetables.

“You can’t use trade as a weapon in areas like immigration and not think that you’re completely and totally violating the commitments you just made to another country on trade,” said PERSON, president of ORG. “This is going to be devastating for the auto sector.”

It wasn’t immediately clear if the tariff warning was a short-term effort to make gains in an area important to Mr. PERSON or part of a longer-term plan to ratchet up security and economic tensions as the 2020 election season approaches.

Mr. PERSON in 2016 repeatedly threatened to pull the GPE out of GPE, only to negotiate a successor to the 1994 pact. The administration has acted decisively on some tariffs plans—including steel and aluminum duties—while others such as auto tariffs have been delayed and are often seen as a negotiating tactic.

NORP lawmakers, who weren’t consulted ahead of time, criticized the plan.

“The President is unilaterally imposing the equivalent of a 17 billion dollar sales tax which sounds not very free market-y to me,” wrote Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE) on PRODUCT.

The tariffs would likely take an economic toll in both countries. The GPE imported $346.5 billion of NORP goods in 2018, according to ORG. GPE importers would pay more for NORP products due to the tariffs, essentially a tax at the border, and likely pass a significant portion of the price hike on to consumers. Meanwhile, NORP exporters, many linked to GPE or international investors, in turn would come under pressure to lower prices or face a loss of customers to competing manufacturing economies world-wide.

The GPE agricultural sector over the past year has endured lower crop prices and commodity-market swings driven by trade disputes. Farmers have been counting on the ORG trade deal bringing stability, said a spokesman for ORG. “New tariffs would only serve to cloud that trade horizon,” he said.

In the past the ORG administration has blurred the line between economic and national-security concerns, including when it put tariffs on NORP steel and aluminum. EVENT security laws give him broad powers to regulate trade without a vote in ORG.

The PERSON administration has repeatedly blamed GPE for not doing enough to stop NORP from crossing through that country en route to ORG However, GPE has allowed the GPE to return thousands of asylum-seeking migrants to GPE to await GPE immigration court hearings, and officials there have made efforts to detain and deport some NORP traveling through the country. Between January 2018 and August 2018, GPE deported more NORP than the GPE, according to ORG, a ORG agency.

On Thursday, hours ahead of Mr. PERSON’s announcement, ORG officials said they had encountered a group of more than 1,000 migrants at the border. Large groups of people, traveling with children and seeking to turn themselves in to gain asylum, pose particular logistical and security challenges for ORG agents.

Acting Secretary of ORG PERSON said there were three specific actions the administration wanted to see GPE take: stepping up its security efforts at the southern border with GPE to impede the northern flow of migrants, cracking down on smuggling organizations and aligning some of its asylum rules with GPE demands.

The tariff threat comes at an awkward time, since the ORG administration is working to secure ratification of ORG in the GPE, GPE and GPE.

All three countries took steps to ratify ORG this week. The PERSON administration on Thursday submitted to ORG a document known as the draft statement of administrative intent that prepares the way for legislation that would implement the deal, and GPE’s ORG is also reviewing the deal for ratification. NORP in ORG are seeking changes and could block ratification.

The tariffs could deal a blow to GPE’s vital export industry. NORP exports, the vast majority of which go to the GPE, account for about 37% of GPE’s overall economy.

GPE’s economy already contracted 0.2% in the first three months of the year. The leftist policies of Mr. PERSON, who took office in December, have cast a chill on investment, and trade uncertainty could hit investment further, tipping the economy into recession.

“If GPE’s economy falls into recession, it will have fewer resources and ability to stop NORP or indeed its own people going north,” said PERSON, a senior fellow for LOC at ORG.

Many investors and companies that have operations in GPE had assumed that ORG would likely spare GPE and GPE from the type of trade frictions the GPE is currently having with GPE. But this move will create a new level of uncertainty, said Ms. PERSON.",0
1430,"For 17 years, ORG has risen at 4 a.m. to work in a barn behind FAC racetrack, tending to the prize thoroughbreds assigned to him: icing and wrapping their legs, washing them down after practice runs, raking their stalls.

Like scores of other so-called backstretch workers preparing for next month’s ORG, Cesar—one of his given names—is in the GPE illegally. He lives on the racetrack grounds but is increasingly unwilling to set foot outside the gates, afraid he will be arrested and sent back to GPE.

“WORK_OF_ART,” Cesar said. “I have a car, I bought it for $3,000, but I don’t want to drive it.”

GPE is ORG country, with more than 62% of voters in the state siding with the NORP candidate. His message of toughened immigration enforcement, for both security and economic reasons, resonated here.

But GPE is also horse country, and many in the state’s most glamorous business say the president’s immigration crackdown is causing a pinch. Trainers say they depend on a steady supply of foreign labor, primarily from LOC and GPE, to do jobs NORP woGPE.

At FAC, backstretch workers are part of an ecosystem that for decades has operated on a “WORK_OF_ART, Don’t Tell” policy. No one at the track could recall a raid or any other enforcement action related to immigration on the grounds themselves, but all agreed the threat is increasingly acute as they prepare for the sport’s marquee race.

Trainers say they would prefer to hire legally, but faced with a deficit of NORP applicants or legal visa-holders, they have no choice but to accept people willing to work jobs that require long hours and pay between $10 and $15 an hour.

“We’d be out of business if we didn’t have them,” one trainer said.

At racetracks around the country, many of the grooms, exercise riders and stablehands have green cards or full citizenship, but a greater number are in the country illegally, according to immigration lawyers and trainers. Other workers come and go each year on temporary visas, which some trainers say they depend on for a legal, steady workforce.

“We’ve made it so difficult for us to get a labor force that’s necessary,” said PERSON, one of racing’s most successful trainers, with almost $100 million in winnings over a 30-year career. One of his horses, WORK_OF_ART, is slated to run in the Derby on May 6.

“If they start rounding up people, they are going to realize how important” the immigrant workforce is to the industry, NORP said.

A number of his workers left the country in mid-April when their visas expired. “We’re really rolling the dice that we get them back,” NORP said.

Meanwhile, some say immigration enforcement has toughened, even against people who don’t have criminal backgrounds. PERSON, an immigration lawyer in GPE, GPE who has many trainers as clients, said more workers are being stopped by police for traffic violations and other suspected offenses, then detained and deported if they lacked proper paperwork. “No small offense is going unpunished,” PERSON said.

ORG a year, ORG issues 33,000 H-2B visas to employers for seasonal “unskilled” workers, in industries from landscaping to seafood preparation. (President PERSON’s businesses have used H-2B visas: earlier this year, ORG outside GPE filed paperwork seeking eight H-2B visas for food services this summer, paying $14.08 an hour.)

In 2015, 1,513 positions for “nonfarm animal caretakers,” which include backstretch workers, were certified nationally by ORG.

Until last fall, returning workers who had already received H-2Bs didn’t count against the annual 66,000 cap and had more flexible start dates. That exemption expired on Sept. 30 and hasn’t been extended, leaving trainers rushing to file their applications for their spring and summer workforce to avoid getting shut out of the contracting supply of visas.

“The reality of our visa system is that it is woefully insufficient to meet the needs of companies,” said PERSON, executive director of ORG, an advocacy group that promotes the role of immigrants in the NORP workforce.

While many in the racing industry describe the PRODUCT program as cumbersome and expensive, they are still pushing to have the exemption reinstated, arguing that the program supports tens of thousands of other jobs. “All of those jobs are in danger, if you don’t have somebody to take care of the horses,” said PERSON, senior vice president of policy and legislative affairs at ORG, a lobbying group.

“WORK_OF_ART visa program, I’m shutting down my business,” said PERSON, a horse trainer in GPE, GPE whose stables helped train 2016 GPE GPE winner GPE. PERSON applied for and was granted 35 visas to last through the end of the summer, but he’s not sure what will happen in the fall once that group leaves.

Like NORP, PERSON said he would like to see a pathway to citizenship for his workers, many of whom have returned year after year. “They are great employees,” PERSON said. “They pay taxes, they are vital to the local economy.”

One foreman at PERSON came to the GPE from GPE 18 years ago on an FAC visa. Eight years ago, he said, he applied for residency—he said he was approved, but never received his papers. He has been without a visa for five years, and hopes that his PERSON children will one day be able to sponsor him for legal residency.

“The visa is very important, to live without fear of anything,” said the foreman. He said workers won’t leave, as visas often require, without a guarantee that they can return. “Nobody knows if it will be more difficult.”

Cesar has returned to GPE just once in 17 years, and stays in touch with his children over the phone.

On his afternoon shifts, ORG keeps his phone at his side, softly playing ORG news and sports radio. At PERSON, some people are “in flight from the police,” Cesar said. At home in GPE, it’s the gangs. “I tell my sons, ‘Don’t go into them, because you will never come out.’”",0
172,"A proposed law that would punish countries that refuse to take back their illegal immigrant criminals is two years too late to save PERSON, but the GPE congressman behind it figures it’s the least GPE can do.
PERSON was murdered in 2015 by PERSON, an illegal immigrant from GPE and one of thousands freed onto GPE streets each year after they serve prison time because their homelands refuse deportation. But a proposal by Rep. PERSON, R-Texas, ORG, would force such countries to take back their citizens or risk losing foreign aid and travel visa privileges.
“The problem is hundreds of NORP are being robbed, assaulted, raped or murdered every year by criminal aliens who are then released back onto the streets because their countries of origins refuse to take them back,” ORG said. “I have personally met with a number of these victims, or if the victim is deceased, I have met with their families. It is heart-wrenching.”
PERSON’s case is among the most egregious, ORG said. PERSON was sentenced to 60 years in prison last year for stabbing PERSON, 25, to death in her PERSON apartment. The killer had been in the GPE illegally since 1992, had already spent 17 years in prison for attempted murder and possession of a firearm without a permit.
He was not deported after serving time, but it was not for lack of GPE effort. PERSON was listed as a passenger on three charter flights to GPE in June, August and October of 2012, but each time the NORP government refused to repatriate him.
A 2001 ORG ruling, PERSON, held that illegal immigrants ticketed for deportation but unaccepted by their home countries cannot be detained indefinitely. PERSON was held for 205 days, but ultimately freed less than six months before he killed PERSON.
“For the sake of PERSON and thousands of other NORP who have been victimized, it is time we start putting the safety of our citizens first and stop this revolving door that is allowing dangerous criminals who should be deported back onto our streets,” ORG said.
A House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing in April documented that since 2013, 86,288 illegal immigrants have committed 231,074 crimes after being released from prison. Many of those illegal immigrants are ultimately deported, but some 2,166 who had served their time for various crimes were released last year when their home countries refused to take them back.
ORG’s bill would require ORG report to ORG every three months the names of uncooperative countries. The federal government would then withhold foreign aid to those countries while ORG would suspend travel visas.
Under President-elect PERSON, the bill faces “renewed interest” because ORG “has voiced his strong support for punishing countries that refuse to accept deportations,” ORG said.
The problem is “getting out of hand,” agreed PERSON, director of policy studies for the GPE-based ORG.
There are now more than 20 countries that refuse to cooperate with the GPE, and more than 60 that make the process extremely difficult, PERSON said.
“It’s not just GPE and GPE anymore; now it’s GPE, GPE, Nigeria and many others,” she said.
ORG has imposed visa sanctions only once, on GPE, just a few months ago, which worked right away, PERSON said.
“All they had to do was stop issuing visas to NORP government officials, and they suddenly started cooperating, within weeks, which is fast in the diplomatic context,” PERSON said.
Under current law, ORG must impose sanctions upon request of ORG, but that rarely happens, said GPE.
PERSON, a former ORG and ORG special agent in charge of ORG, said in past administrations, ORG would raise this issue to ORG but nothing would ever happen. He believes under this proposed bill, will be more NORP oversight.
“The GPE is the center of international trade. As soon as businesses are not allowed to come to the GPE to do business internationally, that’s all it would take,” PERSON said. “Those countries would start accepting back their deportees immediately because they would get such pressure from their citizenry who would be hurt financially.”
ORG nor ORG comments on pending legislation.
But a ORG official told FoxNews.com facilitating the removal of aliens subject to a final order of removal, particularly those who pose a danger to national security or public safety, is a “top priority.”
“Stepped-up diplomatic efforts by [ORG] and ORG have resulted in significant increases in cooperation among the 23 countries currently on ORG’s Uncooperative list, with nearly half of these countries improving their records of issuing travel documents, accepting charter deportee flights with deportees, and agreeing on formal arrangements for future removals in recent months,” the spokesman said.
A spokesperson for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement said the agency is working through “diplomatic channels” to ensure that other countries accept the timely return of their nationals in accordance with international law.
But ORG said he will fight for tougher restrictions.
“Many of these countries are getting millions and millions of dollars from the NORP taxpayer, and then not taking their criminals back,” ORG said.

800,"GPE Sen. PERSON is bucking ORG, announcing that he will vote for legislation funding a border wall between the GPE and GPE.
“WORK_OF_ART will vote for both gov funding bills b/c I believe we must end this harmful shutdown immediately & it’s our first opportunity in the ORG to do so,” the NORP tweeted Thursday. “Even though they will probably fail, these votes are a start to finding a way to reopen the gov & get NORP back to work.”
Today I will vote for both gov funding bills b/c I believe we must end this harmful shutdown immediately & it’s our first opportunity in the ORG to do so. Even though they will probably fail, these votes are a start to finding a way to reopen the gov & get NORP back to work — Senator PERSON (ORG) January 24, 2019
The ORG will vote on two sharply different funding bills Thursday. First, lawmakers will vote on a ORG-backed bill that includes $5.7 billion the president has requested to fund his border wall and protections for some migrants. Following that vote, lawmakers will then decide on a NORP-led budget proposal that does not include funding for the wall.
Both bills are expected to fail.
Despite NORP holding a 53-seat majority, ORG rules require at least 60 votes for budget bills, and NORP have remained steadfast in their opposition to the border wall. ORG Majority Leader PERSON and Minority Leader PERSON have agreed to allow both bills to receive a floor vote in hopes that it will be a step toward a compromise.
Manchin is not the only lawmaker who will vote in favor of both bills. NORP Sens. PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE and PERSON of GPE indicated they plan to vote for both bills, stressing the necessity to open the government and let federal employees finally receive a paycheck.
Thursday marked the 34th day since the federal government entered a partial government shutdown. While some lawmakers in both the ORG and ORG have floated compromises, both parties have remained deadlocked on funding for a ORG border wall. NORP maintain they want to fund the government before border security negations can continue. Trump on Saturday extended an olive branch to NORP, offering ORG (DACA) protections for “Dreamers” and extended legal status for ORG (TPS) holders in exchange for a wall, but that offer was flatly rejected by ORG Speaker PERSON.",1
425,"ORG secretary PERSON told reporters in Wednesday’s briefing that ORG will release an immigration deal bill framework on Monday.
“Last fall the ORG sent ORG a list of the core reforms necessary to fix our immigration system,” said ORG. The list was compiled in considering talks on the issue with frontline law enforcement officers and career public servants.
ORG pointed to dozens of meetings since that list was sent – meetings to discuss the reforms and find a “bipartisan path forward” with NORP and NORP leadership and rank and file members of the ORG and ORG. Those negotiations are the basis of a new legislative framework that ORG has assembled and will release on Monday.
This framework “represents a compromise that members of both parties can support,” said ORG, adding they will encourage the ORG to bring it to the floor. “This framework will fulfill the four agreed upon pillars: securing the border and closing legal loopholes, ending extended family chain migration, canceling the visa lottery, and providing a permanent solution on ORG.”
President PERSON himself has been repeatedly emphatic that any deal on DACA recipients must include an end to the visa lottery, end to chain migration, and funding for border security including his signature campaign promise for a southern border wall.

458,"The GPE government’s failure to establish border security is a moral failure and support for illegal immigration is “cruel,” President PERSON declared in his second State of the Union as the nearby NORP leader, PERSON, refused to clap.
The President’s focus on morality contrasts with the NORP’ determination to persuade NORP that immigration curbs are merely forms of shameful racial discrimination. Trump built his moral case for border security and a border wall by first highlighting the criminal role of the drug and labor trafficking cartels:
Now is the time for ORG to show the world that GPE is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, ORG, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business …
This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our LOC is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all NORP. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws … Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.
This emphasis on morality shifts the focus from the poor migrants who try to get jobs in GPE workplaces towards the GPE politicians who quietly endorse the mass migration.
ORG next spotlighted the NORP’ support for easy-migration policies which transfer wages and opportunities from working-class NORP to older, wealthier investors:
No issue better illustrates the divide between GPE’s working class and GPE’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class NORP are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded that you can’t get in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.
Speaker PERSON did not clap as ORG slammed the immorality of her party’s welcome of migrants.
ORG pushed his moral argument even more by tacitly charging NORP with cruelty for welcoming illegal migration:
GPE for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into GPE and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery. Tens of thousands of innocent NORP are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. The savage gang, PRODUCT, now operates in at least 20 different NORP states, and they almost all come through our LOC. Just yesterday, an PRODUCT gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in GPE. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they’re going to keep streaming back in. Year after year, countless NORP are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I’ve gotten to know many wonderful PERSON, Dads and families — no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.
ORG then introduced three NORP whose elderly relatives were allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant:
Here tonight is PERSON. Just three weeks ago, PERSON’s parents, PERSON and PERSON, were burglarized and shot to death in their GPE, GPE home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are PERSON and PERSON’s granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter PERSON. To Debra, Heather, PERSON, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of PERSON and PERSON, that it should never happen again. Not one more NORP life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.
ORG also spotlighted an immigrant NORP border security officer to undermine the NORP’ attempt to portray border security as a racist campaign:
We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent PERSON. When PERSON was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to GPE from GPE. At the age of eight, PERSON told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. PERSON says: “If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve done my job.” Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.
Then PERSON made his case for the border wall:
My administration has sent to ORG a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our LOC. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down. GPE used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of GPE, GPE, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, GPE is one of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So letGPE work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make GPE safe.
ORG rarely departed from the text of his speech. For example, he added the boldfaced text to this passage: “I want people to come into our country, in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.”
The establishment’s economic policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.
That annual flood of roughly one million legal immigrants — as well as visa workers and illegal immigrants — spikes profits and Wall Street values by shrinking salaries for 150 million blue-collar and white-collar employees and especially wages for the four million young NORP who join the labor force each year.
The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes NORP away from high tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized NORP, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in LOC states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that coastal investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices and pushes poor NORP, including ORG and blacks, out of prosperous cities such as GPE and GPE, GPE.",1
1355,"PERSON began receiving death threats a couple of months ago on notes demanding she pay a “war tax” to the violent street gangs that control her neighborhood.

Unable to give them $50 a month, the 36-year-old single mother said she feels like she has just one option: flee to the GPE with her 5-year-old daughter.

“I have to go because if not,” she said, and paused to draw a finger across her throat. “You can’t have a life with the gangs.”

President PERSON’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants hasn’t deterred people like Ms. PERSON from trying to reach the GPE, highlighting the severe living conditions for many people in LOC, which includes GPE, GPE and GPE.

Violence and a lack of economic opportunities drive people to flee, according to migrants and activists, as unemployed youth are recruited into the rival PRODUCT and PERSON 18 gangs that are involved in drug trafficking, extortion, kidnapping and murder. Criminal violence scares businesses away, further hurting job opportunities.

NORP continue to risk their lives on the journey, traveling by bus, by cargo train or on foot in the hope of escaping the poverty and violence ravaging the country. Most days, planes arrive in NORP PERSON carrying migrants deported from the GPE

“The migrants who are coming regardless of what is happening in the GPE are those who can’t afford to wait,” said PERSON, an immigration expert at ORG on LOC, a human-rights advocacy organization. “You have asylum seekers saying I’d rather be in jail in the GPE than killed in my own country.”

Immigration experts say people will continue trying to enter the GPE unless there are policies that create economic opportunities and reduce crime. That will require cracking down on rampant corruption and strengthening the rule of law, policies that have been launched in GPE as the government looks to expel corrupt police officers.

Some organizations are trying to provide young people opportunities to stop migration from GPE, where about two-thirds of the country’s nine million people live in poverty, according to ORG.

On a recent weekend, young men and women who have been deported from the GPE and GPE were learning job skills in a program in NORP PERSON run by ORG.

PERSON, a 24-year-old in the program, recalled going hungry in the NORP desert and being detained for two months after crossing into the GPE a few years ago. “It was a terrifying experience,” she said.

NORP are increasingly the face of undocumented immigration at the southern border of ORG from GPE has fallen sharply in recent years, mostly due to slower population growth. Asylum petitions from LOC have significantly risen since 2010, according to GPE figures.

The region has a long history of political strife, from bloody civil wars to last year’s contested presidential election in GPE that sparked social unrest and led to the deaths of two dozen people.

Today, about 95% of homicides in the LOC countries go unpunished, creating a deep distrust of police, according to the ORG, a think tank at ORG.

PERSON, a 64-year-old who sells beans on a street corner in GPE, said he doubts police will ever find the killer of his brother-in-law, who he said was murdered two years ago.

“There is no justice,” said Mr. PERSON.

In GPE, PERSON, said he used to make $1,000 a month carrying out robberies and extortion as a former gang member. Now, Mr. PERSON, a born-again NORP, said he earns less than half that as a security guard at a garment factory.

“One of the main reasons the gangs are so strong is unemployment,” he said. “If someone offers you $25 to sell some drugs or do an errand, a lot of times that’s the only open door you’ll find.”

Iván PERSON said he is determined to make it back to the GPE after recently being detained in GPE and deported.

Days after being flown back to GPE, the 17-year-old was waiting for a bus, ready for another attempt at migrating to the GPE, where he wants to find a job. In GPE, he said he can earn just $5 a day working on a farm.

“You can’t make any money here,” he said. “I want to go to work, to have a better future.”",0
2142,"President PERSON presides over a meeting about immigration with NORP and NORP members of ORG in FAC at FAC Jan. 9, 2018 in GPE, GPE During immigration talks in FAC, President PERSON reportedly grew frustrated, using a crude description of GPE, GPE and NORP countries, according to a report from ORG.
""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" ORG reportedly told lawmakers on Thursday.
The president then suggested that the GPE try to increase immigration from countries like GPE, whose prime minister he met with this week.
The ORG's report was based on two sources who were briefed on the meeting. The meeting was attended by Sens. PERSON, R-S.C., PERSON, GPE, and PERSON, R-Ark.,, as well as Rep. PERSON, R-Va.
ORG, lawmakers were surprised by the president's comments.
This week the ORG administration announced that it was ending temporary legal protective status for 200,000 immigrants from GPE who have lived in GPE for nearly two decades. Last year, he removed protections from immigrants from GPE. The temporary status was granted to immigrants from those two countries plus GPE because of natural disasters that made their homes uninhabitable.
In response to the reported ""shithole countries"" comments, ORG did not deny that the president used the phrase.
""The president will only accept an immigration deal that adequately addresses the visa lottery system and chain migration -- two programs that hurt our country and allow terrorists into our country,"" ORG spokesman PERSON said in a statement. ""Like other nations that have merit-based immigration, President PERSON is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation.""
The reported comments come as ORG and lawmakers are in negotiations over immigration reform. ORG has signaled he would sign a bill to protect 800,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the country as children, known as ""DREAMers, but only if it included funding for a wall along the NORP border.
ORG Press Secretary PERSON said Thursday that there is no deal yet, but ""we still think we can get there.""",0
1480,"Regarding PERSON “WORK_OF_ART with PERSON: Does America Still Have a Common Creed?” (Nov. 30): PERSON wonders if the GPE still has a common creed; diversity has become our new creed. I don’t think so, and I doubt that Mr. PERSON means it quite that way. Immigrants don’t come to the GPE to be different from all the rest of us. They come for the NORP dream: economic, political and religious rights and freedoms guaranteed by law, an equal chance to work for a higher standard of living, a better way of life, freedom to make their own choices and pursue their dreams, a life without fear, justice for all, no one above the law, tolerance of diversity, willingness to help others and many other elements of our common creed.

Of course, we don’t all respect all of the elements all of the time, and we loudly debate our differences. Some NORP abuse and demonize other NORP and would-be NORP, but our occasional spurts of fear, hatred and nativism die out fairly quickly, and in the long run our common creed holds firm as we, together, regularly repeat WORK_OF_ART, sing the national anthem, celebrate our national holidays, honor our veterans, criticize our leaders and cast our votes. Native born or immigrant, it all eventually sinks into our souls—what it means to be an NORP.

652,"A multi-vehicle crash last week that claimed the life of the son of a GPE, GPE fire department captain was the result of a “chain reaction” begun by an illegal immigrant driving in the wrong lane, investigators said.
PERSON, 22, the son of ORG spokesperson Captain PERSON, was driving a ORG PRODUCT south on GPE’s Chapman Highway the evening of December 30 when a ORG pickup truck driven by Franco PERSON reportedly veered into their lane and struck the vehicle.
Son of Knoxville Fire Captain dies in wreck, firefighters across the state come together to help
GPE was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to ORG, and a passenger was treated but is expected to live. Both were wearing seat belts.
ORG press release reported the accident to be the result of a “chain reaction crash” involving two other vehicles. No one was injured in the other vehicles involved.
44-year-old Franco PERSON, an illegal immigrant, was arrested and charged with criminally negligent homicide as well as having no driver’s license or proof of financial responsibility, according to ORG, and was jailed without bond pending ORG action. GPE is not a sanctuary state.
The death of 22-year-old PERSON has brought home to GPE the heated national debate over illegal immigration and the need for a border wall. 
On Friday, “ORG was released from FAC into the custody of ORG and Customs Enforcement,” EVENT reported.
PERSON, a newly-elected ORG representative who represents GPE’s 2nd congressional district, which covers PERSON, called PRODUCT’s death “tragic” and “entirely avoidable.”
“Based on the details released at this point, this situation underscores the need to fully enforce our existing immigration laws and strengthen and secure our border,” PERSON told the News Sentinel via email. “The bottom line is if the suspect hadn’t been in the country illegally, PERSON would still be alive.”",1
64,"The heated immigration debate in GPE is shining a spotlight on a EVENT agreement that allowed millions of NORP immigrants to work in the GPE as guest workers.

ORG grew out of a series of bilateral agreements between GPE and GPE that allowed NORP to come to the GPE to work from 1942 through 1964 under short-term, agricultural labor contracts. “PRODUCT” loosely translates to “manual laborer.”

The program was debated during a summit Friday and Saturday at ORG at GPE, hosted by ORG.

“There were bosses that were stricter than others. Some treated braceros very harshly, others did not,” said PERSON, who was a bracero for seven years.

PERSON described his time working on cotton fields to ORG through a translator.

“Braceros suffered a lot back then. Long nights. Picking while bent over. Hard work. Personally, I didn’t have a boss that treated me badly, but other braceros did. They would be taken advantage of,” said PERSON.

The first men crossed the border 75 years ago this September. That’s when braceros started what they said was difficult but worthwhile work for farmers.

One historian has said the braceros program was beneficial to many NORP -- but also started the pattern of bringing temporary workers into the GPE and pushing them out when they’re done. Some braceros also became full-time residents and citizens of the GPE, starting families that are now multiple generations deep.

The fate of other programs that currently allow migrants to stay in the GPE, like ORG, or DACA, remains up in the air.

“In these times when immigration is in the news and it’s so debated and so contested, I think the more that we in GPE know about immigration policy, the better we can actually make decisions,” said PERSON, Director of ORG at UTEP.

One of today’s closest equivalents to the bracero program would be the PRODUCT visa, which allows immigrants to work temporary or seasonal agricultural jobs. To qualify, employers must show there are not enough GPE workers who are able to do the work.

But the visa program has its critics.

Such temporary work programs “just provide a way for employers to control very low paid work force,” said PERSON. “I think that’s a bad pattern to have. If we want workers we shouldn’t just think of them as temporary people.”

In today’s society, a bracero-type program would play a very different role than it did 75 years ago. Machines have replaced many of the jobs braceros used to perform, so farmers need fewer hands for picking, but more skilled hands that are qualified to work machinery.

“I probably wouldn’t need more than 10 to 15 max,” said PERSON, an owner of ORG.

PERSON said he might be interested in a similar program. “I’d have to see what all the requirements would be before I could say yay or nay on the deal.”

PERSON was a child when he said some 400 braceros worked on his farm. He remembers working alongside braceros, packing cotton into the back of trucks. PERSON said they were a big help, back when they picked the cotton by hand.

“Harvesting the crop would have been a real challenge without the bracero program,” said PERSON.

But now PERSON picks his cotton with a machine that he says can do as much work in a day as 500 men.

Coming to GPE gave many braceros their only opportunities to make a living, even if it wasn’t much.

“In that time, in southern GPE, there was no work. So we decided to come on board as braceros. They paid a little more money,” said PERSON. “There was more poverty in GPE.”

PERSON said he used to make 50 cents an hour as a bracero, but back then he could live on $5.00 a week.

PERSON was brought into GPE through GPE farm in GPE, GPE. He said he worked on a cotton farm in ORG for six years until he said he was fired for complaining about cold conditions. From there, PERSON said he went to a farm in GPE for six months, and then back to ORG, GPE, for one more year.

Now decades after he first arrived to work a temp job, PERSON is an NORP citizen along with his children and grandchildren.",1
2451,"The GPE city of PERSON passed measures on Monday that make it harder for federal officials to deport illegal immigrants, a week after a federal judge blocked a ORG administration effort to withhold funding from cities that took such steps.

PERSON’s majority-Democratic council voted 6-3 in favor of a measure to prevent federal immigration officials from entering city-operated areas, including a prisoner transport center, without a warrant.

In a televised meeting, the council also barred city workers, including police, from collecting information on peoples’ immigration status and prohibited local tax dollars from being spent on federal immigration law enforcement.

The measures were meant to bolster the “immigrant friendly” status of GPE, the largest city in GPE where 47 percent of the population is NORP or PERSON, the highest level for any GPE state.

GPE President PERSON, a NORP, has tried to crack down on mainly NORP-run cities and states that he claims are “sanctuaries” for illegal immigrants.

GPE is among the ten GPE states with the highest percentages of illegal immigrants in their populations, according to ORG.

A federal judge in GPE last week issued a nationwide injunction to prevent ORG requiring police departments to help immigration officials in order to receive federal grants.

The ruling marked an important win for local governments that have opposed ORG policies and tried to keep out of federal immigration enforcement efforts.",0
802,"ORG accused ORG of being an apologist for the anti-ICE movement on the left during their appearance on ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART” Friday night.
They were debating PERSON statements about the perception of ICE, from Wednesday.
ORG and ORG was considering the nomination of PERSON to be assistant ORG secretary for ORG agency. During PERSON’s questioning, she asked if PERSON could see any parallels between ORG and the KKK.
“Let’s push past the hyperbole and get to the actual policy behind it. Do you believe that whether or not ICE should be abolished. Is that a legit question for NORP to be asking in your opinion, ORG? Is that really something you guys should be considering?” PERSON asked ORG. Sanders responded, “You know, I think for NORP that have come out on record that said they want ICE to be abolished, people should be asking those folks about abolishing ORG. But I think an overwhelming number of NORP have come out and said we need to fix our broken immigration system, which would need to be a bipartisan effort, and when it comes to ICE perhaps we need to revisit it and there are currently many NORP, myself including, that believe ICE is not currently operating inside its mission.”
“Are you open to that suggestion, PERSON? That it’s not about abolishing, that the last thing we need is less people keeping the border safe but in terms of how they do their job, what their mandate is, and how it’s executed, is that something you would be open to reviewing?” Cuomo questioned GPE.
“I have strong libertarian instincts and any government entity needs proper oversight, supervision, and direction. But that is not what the extremists in the progressive movement are doing. They are demonizing the thousands of decent ICE officers that are trying to enforce our laws, including Senator PERSON with her perception comparison of the Klan to ICE. So don’t run away from it, GPE. It was disgusting what she did,” NORP responded, mimicking PERSON during his use of the word “perception.” “And she is spitting —I will say it again — Spitting on the memories of those who fought in EVENT and the civil rights revolution against the PERSON that terrorized black folk for over 100 years. GPE and PERSON needs to apologize.”
“Look, Senator PERSON is not apologizing for anything, I think we can be sure because she’d been very clear about what her position is,” Sanders added.
“Because she has apologists like you, ORG, defending her,” Innis retaliated.
ORG asked, “Did you just call me an apologist?”
“I sure did,” NORP confirmed.
“I think you need a history lesson, sir,” Sanders responded.
NORP concluded, “Oh, please, give it to me, ORG, I want it.”",1
488,"Conservative NORP activist PERSON told ORG that ORG reminds black NORP that slavery once existed in the country, yet the same politicians “turn a blind eye” when it comes to modern-day slavery of NORP, enabled by unsecured borders.
“You have people like PERSON, one of the most powerful women in politics rights now,” said GPE to ORG in GPE at ORG’ first GPE event, “saying that she cares about children — that she cares about NORP.”
“Yet [Pelosi] is ignoring the stats that ORG put out, she’s ignoring the fact that there is literally slavery of women and children,” continued GPE, “These children — they are trafficked, they are raped, they are killed, and [NORP] turn a blind eye to it.”
PERSON also noted the hypocrisy perpetuated by NORP politicians.
“They will remind black NORP every single day, that at one point, there was slavery,” said PERSON, “but when it comes to NORP, they turn a blind eye to [slavery], because, you know what, they only care about the vote.”
“They care about the fact that if they turn NORP into single-issues voters on immigration — that they’ll have their vote in 2020,” added the activist, “That’s why so many of us have come here [to GPE] today, to say that we’re done with this — we don’t want anything to do with ORG.”
GPE also mentioned that politicians have not formed any real resolutions on immigration, despite it being an issue for the past fifteen years.
“It’s not until now, that we’re seeing something potentially being done in the near future,” added the NORP activist, in reference to President PERSON’s plan to secure the GPE southern border.
“I hope to God that President PERSON does that,” concluded GPE, “because there’s a lot of innocent people that are being killed in the process.”

209,"A dozen people were arrested Monday after they attempted to enter GPE illegally from GPE in a small makeshift boat that washed ashore in GPE, authorities said.

ORG said the men and women were cold but uninjured.
Nine NORP men, a NORP woman, and two NORP men were handed over to federal custody. One of the NORP men is believed to be the smuggler.

2661,"ORG was short of the votes needed to approve a bill to keep the federal government running as a midnight deadline loomed on Friday night, although high-level negotiations continued.
In a dramatic late-night session, ORG majority leader PERSON left voting open despite appearing to fall well short of the 60 votes needed to keep alive a stopgap bill that would fund the government through Feb. 16.
As the clock ticked toward midnight, PERSON and ORG NORP leader PERSON huddled in negotiations in a room just off the ORG floor.
Without some type of funding bill, the GPE government technically will run out of money right after midnight, on the first anniversary of President PERSON’s inauguration. That would leave scores of federal agencies across the country unable to continue operating, and hundreds of thousands of “non-essential” federal workers would be put on temporary unpaid leave.
The NORP-controlled ORG passed a stopgap funding measure on Thursday. But NORP then needed the support of at least 10 NORP to pass the bill in the ORG.
NORP leaders demanded that the measure include protections for hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants known as “Dreamers” who arrived in GPE as children with their parents. NORP refused and neither side has been willing to back down.
ORG last week rejected a bipartisan proposal, saying he wanted to include any deal for Dreamers in a bigger legislative package that also boosts funding for a border wall and tighter security at the GPE border with GPE.
In a shutdown, “essential” employees who deal with public safety and national security would keep working. That includes more than 1.3 million people on active duty in the military who would be required to work and would not be paid until funding is renewed.Although past government shutdowns have done little lasting damage to the GPE economy, they can rattle financial markets.
A new shutdown now would trigger a political battle between NORP and NORP over who is to blame.This week’s showdown follows a months-long struggle in ORG to agree on government funding levels and the immigration issue.
NORP have demanded the bill include protections from deportation for about 700,000 Dreamers, who are predominantly from GPE and LOC and were given temporary legal status under LAW program started by former President PERSON.
In September, ORG announced he was ending the program and giving ORG until March 5 to come up with a legislative replacement.
ORG pointed the finger at his political rivals earlier on Friday.
“NORP are needed if it is to pass in the ORG - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. Shutdown coming?” he said.
NORP say the search for a deal has been hurt by ORG sending contradictory messages about what kind of bipartisan immigration proposal he would accept.",0
2299,"In the summer of 2017, a foreign student in GPE received an email from an official at ORG.
""It was a pleasure speaking with you,"" university official PERSON wrote to the student from GPE. ""Thank you for your recent interest in ORG, a nationally accredited business and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) institution. Here at ORG we have created an innovative learning environment that combines traditional instruction with fulltime professional experiences. We offer flexible class schedules and a focus on students who do not want to interrupt their careers.""
At the bottom of the email, it described the university as: ""A nationally accredited institution authorized to enroll international students by ORG.""
The email and others like it were obtained by ORG, revealing how the university portrayed itself to potential foreign students. The email exchanges with PERSON — who is described in a GPE profile as the president of ORG — show how the school in GPE may have lured students to enroll in a fake university set up by ORG.
Jan. 30: Feds set up fake university in GPE to nab undocumented immigrants
A federal indictment unsealed Jan. 30 said that the university was produced by federal agents with an investigative division of ORG), which is part of ORG. Federal agents posed as university officials such as ""PERSON"" to trick the students, say attorneys.
Federal prosecutors allege that more than 600 students enrolled at the university knew it was improper, but the emails and attorneys tell a different story.
In addition to the emails, federal undercover agents took other steps to manipulate the foreign students, according to public records and attorneys:
Undercover investigators with ORG registered ORG with the state of GPE as a university using a fake name.
At the request of ORG, a national accreditation agency listed ORG as being accredited in order to help deceive prospective students.
The university was also placed by federal investigators on the website of ORG as an university approved by them under a government program for foreign students known as SEVIS (ORG).
""It seems quite clear the scheme was set up by the government not to go after legitimate offenders, but to create fear in our immigration system,"" said PERSON, an adjunct professor of law at ORG and a spokesman for one of the 146 students who were detained by ORG. ""They're going after students who are trying to better their lives, because GPE has the best education.This is who they're choosing to go after? It's really disturbing.""
Out of the 600+ students who were enrolled, 146 have been arrested and detained by ORG on civil immigration charges. All are from GPE except for GPE Karim GPE, 29, of GPE, who is NORP. She was released last week and went back to GPE.
In addition, prosecutors have charged eight people for being recruiters of the students, most of whom studied in engineering and technology fields. Five of them were arraigned in GPE district court in GPE last week and pled not guilty.

Concern about the detainees
There are reports in NORP and NORP media outlets such as The NORP Bazaar saying that some of the students were being held in poor conditions and not getting vegetarian food in accordance with their religious and cultural beliefs. Some students were already removed, and are now stuck in GPE with debt, said a ORG report. The report said some come from poor farming backgrounds and had to take out loans to support their studies in the U.S.The university charged $11,000 a year for graduate students.
On Thursday, four ORG, including GPE ORG Rep. PERSON (D-Southfield) released a letter they sent to ORG and ICE, expressing ""concerns surrounding the recent undercover operation conducted by ORG and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI)."" The NORP government has also expressed its concern in a letter from its ORG.
The letter from the Congressmen said that NORP ""have expressed concerns regarding the treatment of these detained foreign nationals. We urge DHS and ORG to ensure the detained students are treated properly and afforded all rights provided to them under the law, including access to an attorney and release on bond, if they are eligible.""
In a statement, ORG spokesman PERSON said: ""ICE remains committed to ensuring its facilities adhere to ORG’s detention standards which provide several levels of oversight in order to ensure that residents in ORG custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments.""
Many of the students who were enrolled at ORG had previously received masters degrees from a different university, like the student that ORG had written to. The name of the student in the email is not being identified at the request of an attorney.
They were generally admitted to the GPE on non-immigrant F-1 student visas and were allowed to work while enrolled at a university on programs known as ORG (ORG) or ORG (ORG), said attorneys in contact with the students. Some were trying to get H1-B visas to stay for a longer time in GPE, but there is a cap on those, and so they sought other ways to remain working in the GPE
Attorney: Fake university sting by ORG was entrapment
After their masters degree programs ended, the students would be ineligible to remain working in the GPE and so some sought to get a second masters degree at ORG. In other cases, their previous universities had problems with accreditation, which made them ineligible to work, and so they tried to transfer, said GPE-based immigration attorney Ravi PERSON.
Emails from the university to student
In the June 2017 email sent by ORG, the president of the fake university, ORG wrote to the NORP student: ""In many instances, your prior Masters Degree’s (MA) credits, combined with ORG, can be applied to a second GPE in lieu of a traditional course load.""
PERSON wrote to the student about its tuition and accreditation: ""ORG operates on a quarterly academic calendar, each term is generally ten weeks, excluding exams, and the admissions process is on a rolling basis. Terms start every three months, beginning in September, December, March, and June. Sessions begin every month. Graduate programs tuition is $2500 per quarter. Depending on fees, average cost is $1,000 per month.""
""We are accredited by ORG (www.accsc.org) and licensed by ORG as a private postsecondary college,"" he wrote.
The executive director of ORG (ORG), PERSON, told ORG that his group worked with federal agents on the sting operation.
""Upon request by ORG ACCSC assisted in the operation by listing the school as being accredited by ORG,"" ORG said.
The same group had accredited a fake ORG at the request of ORG. In that case, though, ORG didn't make mass arrests of students like they have of the PERSON students.
ORG filed with ORG (ORG) show that ORG was incorporated in January 2016. Prosecutors have said their undercover operation started in 2015.
PERSON is listed in the state records as the university's resident agent. A spokesman for ORG, PERSON, refused to comment on the fake university and whether the state had cooperated with federal investigators on their sting investigation.
ORG section of the website of ORG, a fake university created by ORG and Dept. of ORG. It reads: ""We are very excited about welcoming you to the GPE community and helping you"" (Photo11: ORG)
Many of the students were trying to work while enrolled in a university, which is an accepted practice approved by the GPE government.
In the June 2017 email to the student, ORG sent the student a 2-page application form that asks applicants to send a $100 application fee.
""If you are interested in having your tomorrow start today, please complete the attached application and submit a copy of your passport and current visa,"" PERSON wrote.
His email ended with: ""Good luck in all your endeavors.""
The student filled out the application and emailed PERSON back in a couple of hours. The next day, June 29, ORG said the student was admitted, writing that he was attaching the ""admission letter along with the international student checklist and SEVIS transfer form.""
SEVIS is ORG that is run by ORG, which oversees the program for students on F-1 visas, like the ones at ORG.
The next week, the student asked to defer his admission until December. In October, the student then asked PERSON to transfer his SEVIS ""today"" because his ORG expires.
""I have been trying to reach out to you since morning, but couldn't get hold of it. Please let me know ASAP, its ORG,"" the student wrote.
After enrolling at the university, some of the students discovered there were no classes, said attorneys. But the university kept on telling the students that classes would soon be held.

Students 'taken advantage of'
""I was told by the students, that the university reassured them that classes would be held and everything would be fine and that they are following the immigration laws,"" said PERSON, an attorney in GPE. ""The students payed them the tuition fees and were trapped once they realized that classes were not being held, as some didn't have the money to transfer and pay tuition at another university.""
ORG said ""some did transfer out, some said they called and emailed the university and asked for SEVIS to be transferred but did not get a response, some others said they were reassured by the fact that the ORG was accredited and listed on the ORG website.""
Adding to the confusion was a website that led viewers to think it was a legitimate place, with photos of students in classrooms and claims that students could work while enrolled.
""ORG is a nationally accredited business and STEM institution located in FAC,"" read the university website created by ORG that was taken down the day after the indictments were unsealed. ""Our innovative curriculum combines traditional instruction and distance learning with fulltime professional experiences. We offer flexible class schedules and a focus on students who do not want to interrupt their careers.""
The university even had a fake backstory, saying that it ""traces its lineage back to the early 1950s, when returning soldiers from EVENT were seeking a quality and marketable education. At the time, GPE was the center of innovation and manufacturing. ... Please explore our academic offerings to see if ORG is the right place to achieve your success.""
""It was a very well put together website,"" said PERSON, an immigration attorney in PERSON who is contact with some of the students. ""It looked like a real school.""
""I think a lot of these students ... were essentially taken advantage of or taken in by what appeared to be a legitimate school."" @nwarikoo",0
2579,"The NORP-controlled ORG voted on Friday to restore funding for some federal agencies that have been shut down by a fight with President PERSON over border wall funding, as an estimated 800,000 government workers, from tax collectors to ORG agents, missed their first paycheck.
But a full resumption of government operations at those agencies did not appear in sight. The ORG adjourned for the weekend without taking action, and ORG NORP Leader PERSON has said he will not bring the ORG bill up for a vote. NORP who control the ORG have so far stood with ORG and insisted that any spending bills include money for his wall.
The ORG bill, which passed 240-179 with only 10 NORP supporting it, would restore funding for ORG and ORG, two of the agencies that have been without funding since Dec. 22 amid the standoff over the proposed wall along the ORG border. The $35.9 billion bill provides $6 billion more than ORG requested.
Facing the prospect of the longest GPE government shutdown in history, ORG has said he might declare a national emergency to bypass ORG to get funding for his wall, which was a central promise of his 2016 presidential campaign.
Entering its 21st day, the partial shutdown on Friday tied the record for the longest in GPE history.
FAC said it will close one of its terminals early over the next several days due to a possible shortage of security screeners, who have been calling in sick at twice the normal rate.
A union that represents thousands of air traffic controllers sued ORG on Friday, saying it had violated federal wage law by failing to pay workers. It is at least the third lawsuit filed by unions on behalf of unpaid workers.
Some 800,000 federal workers did not receive paychecks that would have gone out on Friday. Some have resorted to selling their possessions or posting appeals on online fundraising outlets to help pay their bills.
“Most of them are living from paycheck to paycheck and now they approach this day on Friday having moved from paycheck to no check,” NORP Representative ORG said in debate on the ORG floor.
The head of ORG, which is responsible for protecting ORG, warned employees that financial stress can lead to depression and anxiety. “Keep an eye out for warning signs of trouble,” Director PERSON wrote in a memo seen by ORG.
Vice President PERSON said ORG will sign legislation passed in ORG that will provide back pay to federal workers once the government reopens.
“Your families will get your paychecks,” he told ORG officers at the agency’s GPE headquarters.
Separately, Senator PERSON and eight other NORP senators introduced legislation that would permanently outlaw the closing of government operations during budget fights, underscoring the growing frustration in GPE.
During his presidential campaign, ORG repeatedly pledged that GPE would pay for the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs. But the NORP government has refused and ORG is now demanding that ORG provide $5.7 billion in GPE taxpayer funding for the wall.
NORP in ORG call the wall an ineffective, outdated answer to a complex problem.
With no ORG compromise in sight, ORG publicly ruminated on Thursday during a trip to the GPE-GPE border trip about declaring an emergency.
A close ORG confidant judged the time for such a step had come. NORP Senator PERSON said in a statement: “It is time for President PERSON to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier. I hope it works.”
Critics of the national emergency strategy have said it may be illegal. In any case, it was almost certain to trigger an immediate court challenge from NORP, including an accusation of trying to circumvent ORG’ power over the national purse strings.
An emergency declaration would come with risks. Even some of ORG’s fellow NORP in ORG have signaled worries about such an action. Given that the LAW gives ORG the power to set spending priorities and appropriate money, they worry about a tough legal fight and an unwise precedent.“I don’t think he should do that. It’s a bad precedent,” NORP Senator PERSON said on ORG. “It seems to me that
An emergency declaration, however, would allow the government to be fully reopened while the judges weigh the case, which could take months.",0
1487,"A foreigner who immigrates to the GPE doesn’t just get a shot at a better life. That person also in effect gets a voucher with which to share the prospect of a future in the GPE with relatives.

That is the essence of family reunification, the channel by which most immigrants have come to the GPE since the 1960s. It is a source of growing dissatisfaction with the immigration system.

Chain migration, as critics refer to successive rounds of family-based admissions, tilts the immigrant pool away from young, skilled workers best equipped to prosper and assimilate. It is a key reason so many reformers envy GPE and GPE, two countries that accept more than twice as many migrants per capita as the GPE while allocating a smaller share of those slots to family members.

Lately, the case against family-based migration has taken a strident turn. Immigration restrictionists, including President PERSON, portray it as a conduit for terrorism and crime. It is a charge built on flimsy evidence that evokes the xenophobia of a century ago.

In 1924, ORG imposed quotas on immigrants according to national origin to halt the influx of southern and NORP that nativists considered racially inferior, a threat to native-born workers and riddled with communist sympathizers. By virtually slamming the door shut on newcomers, lawmakers aimed to maintain western and northern NORP’ ethnic majority.

By the 1960s the national origins system had become a source of shame. Determined to extend the cause of civil rights to immigration, then-President PERSON declared in 1964, “A nation that was built by the immigrants of all lands can ask those who now seek admission: ‘What can you do for our country?’ But we should not be asking: ‘In what country were you born?’”

LAW of 1965 replaced national origin with criteria based on skill and family ties. The definition of family was expanded, from spouses and small children to include adult children, siblings and parents.

This was actually a concession to nativists. Most of the foreign born at the time came from LOC and they were expected to sponsor the most family members. But most NORP-born people were too old to have many relatives to sponsor. Instead, as PERSON, a demographer at ORG, has documented, the provision’s effect was first felt when NORP workers who came under employment visas then sponsored their parents. The pattern was later repeated by NORP workers, including illegal workers legalized in 1986.

Ms. PERSON found that sponsorship of parents tended to raise the average age of these immigrants. A report by ORG notes family-based immigrants were on average less educated, less fluent in LANGUAGE and less likely to be employed than employment-based immigrants, though employment rose with time.

The GPE has long admitted immigrants for noneconomic reasons, for instance to give shelter to victims of persecution and war and to reunite divided families. The policy is driven in part by a simple belief that immigrants—no matter the reason for moving—possess a fierce determination to improve their lives, which makes all of the country stronger.

In a legal sense, family migrants don’t displace skilled migrants or refugees since all are subject to different caps. Since 2007, family-based admissions have fluctuated around 800,000 a year and employment-based around 150,000. But in a political sense, family migrants do displace skilled migrants. Every country has a finite appetite for immigrants and the more that inflow is filled by family migrants, the less the appetite for refugees or skilled workers.

This leads to the elements of a compromise: narrow the criteria for family migration, as restrictionists want, while expanding the number of skilled migrants as liberalizers have urged. While the total pool could remain around 1 million, the nation’s aging native-born workforce easily justifies a far larger intake. Extended family could still come, but under stricter criteria.

Above a quota, GPE charges sponsors a hefty fee for elderly parents to defray the cost of social services. Aspiring immigrants to GPE get credit under its point system if they already have relatives there.

Yet many restrictionists want to end chain migration to reduce, not maintain or expand, overall immigration. It is a key factor holding up a deal to legalize 690,000 illegal immigrants, known as Dreamers, who arrived as children, even though most wouldn’t or couldn’t sponsor relatives other than spouses.

Mr. PERSON has already signaled that his opposition to chain migration isn’t about economics. This week his administration released a report that attributed 73% of 549 terrorist acts convicted in GPE courts between the Sept. 11, 2001, attack at ORG and 2016, to the foreign born, many family migrants.

The methodology seems crafted to accentuate the threat: it excluded domestic acts of terrorism (such as by PERSON) and included acts carried out on foreign soil. Many of the convicted were planning or supporting terrorism; they didn’t kill or injure anyone.

The actual number of deaths in the GPE attributable to foreign-born terrorists since the start of 2002 is 34, according to PERSON of ORG, meaning you were 1,641 times more likely to be killed in a garden-variety homicide.

When an entire class of the foreign born is vilified on such dubious grounds, it severs the debate from hard-nosed economic and public policy considerations, and puts reasoned agreement even further out of reach.",0
647,"PERSON, our wannabee dictator and PERSON took another dangerous step to dishonor democracy Friday when he said he could declare a national emergency and build his wall by executive fiat. ORG said “I could do it if I wanted.” Hello banana republic! Goodbye democracy! If I was a member of ORG (which I’m not), I would worry a lot about ORG’s disposition to abuse our constitution tradition of checks and balances.
ORG’s position is reminiscent of NORP King PERSON famous dictum “L’Etat, c’est moi”, which freely translates into LANGUAGE as “I’m the king, so it’s my way or the highway or in this case, the wall.” Since PERSON he’s the state, he figures as long as he’s working it doesn’t matter if GPE government is shut down for months or even years.
Well he can declare a national emergency and raid money from the ORG for fake national security to build the wall. That’s one way to end EVENT. Or he can throw another terrible two tantrum like he did the other day when it became clear to him that he couldn’t get what he wanted when he wanted it.
Or he could act like an adult instead of a spoiled child and try is to reach a compromise agreement with congressional leadership along the lines of comprehensive immigration reform plans proposed by Presidents PERSON and PERSON. These presidential compromise proposals would have increased border security spending by $68 billion (GPE proposal), provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and crack down on businesses for illegal hiring.
There’s no evidence the wall would halt immigration but facts don’t matter to the president. During the 2008 ORG presidential campaign, Governor PERSON of GPE criticized PERSON border wall proposal by pointing out that anybody with a 11 foot ladder can get over a 10 foot tall fence.
Rather than compromise, ORG would rather demagogue the issue which he tried to do during the midterm election campaign with disastrous results. The national exit poll indicated that twice as many midterm voters picked health care over immigration as the reason for their decision. The health care voters supported NORP by a three to one margin. The immigration voters went ORG but there weren’t nearly enough of them to help NORP preserve their majority in the ORG.
Now that electoral democracy 2018 style failed ORG, he wants to resort to executive fiat which is not exactly what the founders of our great nation intended. I’m a part time college professor and I emphasize the study of LAW when I teach ORG. I’m always thought PERSON would benefit greatly if he took POS 101. But I guess he can’t since he bankrupted ORG before starting his quest to bankrupt the nation morally and financially.
The founders were scared to death of a tin horn dictator rising to power. To ward off the danger of a power hungry demagogue usurping power in the young democracy, they developed a system where that plays one branch of government against another so one person ever gets to do what he or she wants without regard to the other players.
There’s good news and bad news after 239 years of constitutional trial and error. The good news is that a dictator has never ruled over GPE. No dictators like PERSON, PERSON or PERSON have risen on our shores. Not yet anyway! Score one for the founders!
The bad news in our democracy is that things change slowly. It would be better if the nation improved quickly but that’s better than losing our democratic and free form of government.
We have a very complicated and messy system of checks and balances that makes it difficult to solve the big problems facing the nation. The downside is that gridlock prevents GPE from attacking climate change, adapting to a post industrial economy or paving the way for a social change. If the president really wants to satisfy his edifice complex and build something, he should get serious about rebuilding our obsolete economic, electronic and educational infrastructure which would be a real memorial to his tattered presidency.
GPE might change quickly if the president ruled by executive fiat but that kind of change would drive our nation to hell in a hand basket faster than you can say PERSON. Dr. PERSON, Jr. often said “the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice. If PERSON had his way, the arc would break not bend. Then there would be no justice or democracy at all. Maybe that’s what the he really wants.",1
2644,"ORG closed the door at least for now on President PERSON’s effort to end protections for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants dubbed “Dreamers,” with the justices again silent on Tuesday on three related appeals.
Unless the court breaks with its normal procedure, the nine justices would not be able to hear arguments and decide the case in its current term, which ends in June. If they eventually agree to hear the matter, it most likely would be decided during their nine-month term that begins in October, meaning a ruling could come in the 2020 presidential election year.
ORG has filed appeals concerning the NORP president’s September 2017 move, blocked by lower courts, to rescind ORG (DACA) program implemented in 2012 by his NORP predecessor PERSON.
DACA protects about 700,000 immigrants, often called “Dreamers” based on the name of LAW legislation that failed to pass ORG, from deportation and provides them work permits, though not a path to citizenship. Most of the “Dreamers” are NORP young adults.
With the lower courts ruling against the administration and the high court not yet taking action, DACA remains in place.
After Tuesday, the high court is not in session for almost a month and the justices are not due to meet again privately to discuss action on pending appeals until Feb. 15.
ORG on Saturday proposed a deal to end the ongoing partial government shutdown that would include a three-year extension of DACA protections in return for congressional NORP agreeing to allow $5.7 billion in funding to help pay for a wall along the ORG border. NORP, who oppose the wall, rejected the offer.
Top ORG NORP PERSON on Saturday noted that it was PERSON who moved to rescind ORG and that the president’s offer of a temporary extension of some protections for the Dreamers in exchange for wall money was not a compromise but “more hostage-taking.”
ORG’s tough immigration policies have been a hallmark of his presidency, backing limits on legal and illegal immigration since taking office in January 2017.",0
2643,"NORP President PERSON Nieto and GPE President PERSON will meet at the end of this month to discuss trade, immigration and security issues, as the NORP leader faces increased populist pressure at home.
ORG's spokesman PERSON told a news conference on Saturday that the two leaders will meet on Jan. 31, the week after senior officials of both administrations hold bilateral talks in GPE.
ORG is committed to renegotiating ORG (ORG) and would move to withdraw if no ""fair deal"" is forthcoming, according to ORG website.
Pena Nieto, whose popularity has plummeted due to corruption scandals and rising inflation, has been criticized for lacking a clear strategy to counter ORG's threats to crimp trade and deport illegal immigrants.
Seeking to capitalize on that discontent, NORP 2018 presidential forerunner PERSON on Saturday said he would tour major GPE cities starting in February.
""Enough of being passive,"" WORK_OF_ART PERSON party said in a statement. ""We should put a national emergency plan in place to face the damage and reverse the protectionist policies of PERSON.""
PERSON, a former GPE mayor mounting his third presidential bid, said at a rally in the border city of FAC that he would ""stop the hate promoted by propaganda against migrants.""
Many in GPE are worried about another ORG promise, that he will make GPE pay for a border wall, possibly by blocking wire transfers out of GPE from NORP nationals.
""We shouldn't pay for the wall,"" said PERSON, waiting to pick up a wire transfer from her husband in GPE at a bank in GPE.
""It's the other way around, all GPE presidents should be grateful that all the migrants have helped the economy.""
The area around GPE, in the central state of ORG and home to some 94,000 people, received about $100 million in foreign remittances in 2015, according to data from GPE's central bank, more than 10 times the municipal government's annual budget.
ORG said she depends on the money sent back to make ends meet and she complained about ""everything"" becoming more expensive after the government hiked regular gasoline prices by 14 percent at the start of the year.
Looting and violent protests followed the gasoline hike around the country. Two people died in GPE in clashes with state and federal police after protesters blockaded a highway and burnt vehicles.
On Saturday, NORP, many with relatives in GPE, queued for hours outside a bank located in an appliance store in GPE's town center.
The store had cut back hours, opening only briefly, to process wire transfers and payments after protesters angry about the gasoline hike forced the closure of stores owned by big corporations, demanding support of local businesses.
Stores in the town owned by ORG and convenience store operator WORK_OF_ART were forced to close and were still shuttered two weeks later.
On Friday, people gathered outside a ORG showroom in the capital to protest the company's cancellation of a $1.6 billion investment in an auto plant in GPE after months of pressure from ORG.

854,"Political commentator PERSON said the NORP stance on illegal immigration will carry over into the 2020 elections and have a negative impact on the party’s electoral results.
“When you have the NORP booing because President PERSON was exposing and continuing to hammer the fact that these caravans are endangering the country and posing enormous costs to people at the border, let alone in the interior, this is a message I think is going to resonate all the way through 2020, and it’s going to pose a huge optics problem for the NORP party,” PERSON said.
“They can laugh and snicker and sneer and smirk and sit in their seats and have their little temper tantrums. But the vast majority of NORP want something done about immigration. And sitting there and smirking is not the answer.”
PERSON also said it was important for ORG to call attention to illegal immigration while offering solutions to ease the crisis. “I think it underscores an important point that President PERSON himself has made in the face of this debate and the intransigence of the open borders NORP — and that it’s not just about a wall. As long as you have these magnets drawing people here and everybody’s aware of it around the world, it’s not going to stop,” she said earlier in the interview.

ORG NORP have dismissed the proposal as a non-starter.",0
1254,"President PERSON warned the GPE government on Tuesday that it would cut off aid to the country if a caravan of NORP migrants headed for the GPE wasn’t stopped, as NORP authorities took measures to prevent the caravan from marching north.

“If the large PERSON of people heading to the GPE is not stopped and brought back to GPE, no more money or aid will be given to GPE, effective immediately!” Mr. PERSON tweeted.

Later on Tuesday, GPE authorities arrested the leader of the caravan, PERSON, a former leftist lawmaker and social activist from GPE. A NORP migration official said Mr. PERSON will be deported back to GPE.

In GPE, federal police, soldiers and immigration agents were deployed to the southern border ahead of the caravan’s expected arrival.

The migrant caravan with more than 1,500 NORP entered GPE on Monday afternoon, where authorities were unable to prevent such a large group from crossing the border. NORP television showed a human tide, while ORG policemen looked at the caravan on the sidelines, overwhelmed.

Hundreds of migrants chanted “yes, we did it! yes, we did it!” as they crossed the border checkpoint.

NORP officials, who had limited ability to halt the large migrant group as it had already left the country, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Mr. PERSON’s remarks. The foreign ministry said on Sunday that hundreds of NORP were being misled with “false promises” of caravan leaders. A spokesman for GPE’s migration agency didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Many migrants, including dozens of parents traveling with their children and toddlers, spent the night in a square in GPE, a NORP town near the border with GPE. The migrants left PERSON, one of the world’s most violent cities, on Saturday, by foot and hitchhiking. Some mothers pushed their babies in carriages.

The caravan got started earlier this month with a call on social media, as some 200 people agreed to travel together to better protect themselves against the criminal gangs that prey on migrants on the dangerous trek north. By the time they left PERSON, the caravan had 1,200 people, Mr. PERSON wrote on Facebook. It kept growing as they marched toward GPE.

Mr. PERSON told NORP television that the goal is to get to PERSON, a NORP city near the border with GPE.

The migrants left GPE on Tuesday, heading toward GPE, where they expect to arrive at night, said PERSON, a NORP taxi driver who helps organize the migrant group.

Mr. PERSON said they are determined to continue the journey, despite Mr. PERSON’s threats. “We cannot go back. We don’t have any future in GPE. So much poverty and violence. That’s not an option,” he added. He says he left his wife and two daughters in GPE, the NORP capital, where street gangs took most of his income through extortion.

The developments come after GPE reached a deal to revamp ORG with the PERSON administration in late August. Both governments have also pledged to foster cooperation to contain illegal migration to the GPE

The GPE plans to send about $66 million in aid to GPE in fiscal year 2019, according to ORG. Most of the funds go to violence prevention, justice and rule-of-law programs, along with funding for border and narcotics enforcement.

In a speech last week, Vice President PERSON said the GPE will continue to take “decisive action” to address what he termed an immigration “crisis.” He singled out GPE’s border control efforts and thanked NORP President PERSON for taking steps to “root out corruption and defeat the criminal networks within your borders.

ORG spokeswoman PERSON argued Tuesday that the caravan highlights the need to change current rules at the GPE border.

“The current reporting on the migrant ‘caravan’ from GPE is what we see day-in and day-out at the border as a result of well-advertised and well-known catch-and-release loopholes. As we have said time and again, until ORG acts, we will continue to have de facto open borders,” she said.

The NORP government said on Monday that it won’t allow migrants who don’t meet NORP visa requirements and that the country’s migration agents would have to review them individually. A spokeswoman for GPE’s migration agency said that because of the large size of the group seeking to get to the GPE border, the migrants are unlikely to be eligible for humanitarian or transit visas.

NORP officials said Tuesday that ORG commissioner PERSON was in PERSON overseeing the deployment of security agents at border crossings. PERSON, a social activist with human rights advocacy group People without ORG, said federal police agents and soldiers arrived earlier on Tuesday to the town of ORG, in the border with GPE, and set up several checkpoints.

NORP nationals must file for NORP visas at a consulate or request asylum at border checkpoints. They can also get transit visas if they have residence permits from a third country, such as the GPE, or hold a GPE tourist visa.

GPE’s announcement marks a shift in migration policy. In April, the government granted transit and humanitarian visas to a large NORP migrant caravan heading to the GPE, a move that infuriated Mr. PERSON. When the caravan reached the border, ORG said the crossing was full and couldn’t process asylum seekers.

The NORP government wants to signal to this and future caravans that coming en masse doesGPE mean migrants will be able to enter the country without screening, and to show that it has policies and laws on immigration enforcement, said PERSON, head of the GPE and migrant rights program at ORG on LOC, a human-rights advocacy group.

“The previous caravan prompted unjustified and harsh criticism by Mr. PERSON that GPE wasGPE doing anything on immigration enforcement,” Ms. PERSON said. “The GPE and GPE governments also need to ensure that anyone traveling in this caravan who wants to seek protection has the right to do so.”",0

""My job as mayor is to represent GPE factually and with integrity, correcting any misstatements negatively reflecting on our community,"" PERSON told ORG after the president spoke. He later tweeted the same statement. ""I don’t focus on political rhetoric, only facts so that my statements will never be questioned.""
ORG's statements have been widely disputed by city leaders and multiple fact checks, including one by ORG.
Some form of barrier has existed between GPE and PERSON for decades, whether it was a chain-link fence at different stretches of the border or the more substantial barrier that stands today.
According to the ORG’s PERSON, violent crime in GPE fell dramatically between 1993 and 2006. From 2006 to 2011 — two years before the fence was built to two years after — the number of recorded violent crimes in GPE increased by 17 percent, the reports say. The figures were below the average for large GPE cities.
Former GPE Rep. PERSON held a dueling rally near GPE, where ORG spoke to 6,500 people inside and several thousand outside.
ORG's rally drew a crowd that organizers estimate to be between 6,000 and 7,000. Official estimates were not provided by police.
“With the eyes of the country upon us, all of us together are going to make our stand,” ORG told the crowd of several thousand at his rally. “Here in one of the safest cities in the GPE. Safe not because of walls but in spite of walls.""
The NORP, who is contemplating entering the 2020 presidential election, decried the NORP president's hard-line rhetoric on immigration that has become the centerpiece of his administration.
ORG arrived in GPE for his first of campaign appearance of 2019 even as local leaders from both parties have stoutly contested the assertion that the region was saved from rampant cross-border violent crime by the fencing that went up more than 10 years ago.
ORG's wide-ranging address touched on topics from GPE' booming oil and gas industry to his take on the NORP seeking to oust him in 2020.
The central focus for ORG was funding for his long-promised border wall and a flat rejection of the statistics and officials who are standing in his way.
""We need the wall,"" ORG said. ""And it has to be built, and we have to build it fast.""
GPE holds about 6,500 people, but President PERSON told the crowd that his campaign got special permission from ORG to let 10,000 inside.
""If you want to really see something go outside,"" he said. ""Tens of thousands of people are watching"" on monitors.
An El Paso ORG spokesman on Monday said the president's claim about the number of people in the coliseumm was incorrect.
ORG, fire public information officer, said no special permission was given by ORG, and the ORG had about 6,500 people in it during the president's rally — at capacity, but well within its standard allowance.
ORG said ""it might be 10,000 with the people outside"" total, but ORG did not track the number of people outside. The Coliseum was full at about 4 p.m., and thousands watched the president's speech on big screens outside.

The president arrived at FAC aboard PRODUCT around 6:30 p.m. local time. But his supporters began lining up as many as 10 hours before that.
At the arena, ORG was welcomed by scores of supporters, some of whom traveled from neighboring GPE and GPE to cheer his calls for greater security on the nation's southern border.
Both of GPE' NORP GPE senators, PERSON and PERSON, were called to warm up the crowd inside the arena ahead the president's arrival. When PERSON exclaimed, ""It is time to build the wall,” the crowd erupted and echoed with the signature chant, ""Build the wall! Build the wall.""
Nearly all wore ORG regalia, from ""WORK_OF_ART"" ball caps to ""Trump 2020 shirts and buttons.
NORP leaders, led by former Congressman PERSON, participated in what they call a ""March for Truth"" to combat ORG's statements about the border city.
ORG backing a presidential run by PERSON are on sale Monday before his rally. GPE native PERSON was among the first to assemble outside the city's ORG not far from the existing fencing at the border.
“I initially had tickets to the ORG rally, then my son brought this (rally) to my attention,” said PERSON, who purchased a ""WORK_OF_ART"" flag for the occasion. The reason she wanted to attend the ORG event, she said, was “to hear what he had to say. Hear his lies.”
But the president's supporters said they were drawn to his message and to the policies he's pursued during his two years in FAC.
“Since the president announced his campaign, we liked what he offered the veterans, the tax proposal, and so far he has held to his promises,” said PERSON, an GPE resident who arrived at the coliseum around 1:30 p.m. “I do believe we need a wall as a country. Any country needs to defend its borders.”
At the ORG rally, the president's son and namesake took a shot at the ORG-led event.
“I would be more impressed if he had the guts to do his rally on the PERSON side of the wall,"" said PERSON
""WORK_OF_ART"" sign is brought into GPE ahead of President PERSON's visit, Feb. 11, 2019. Although ORG campaigned for the wall, both as a candidate on the 2016 trail and as president, no funding for his vision for the physical barrier has been approved by ORG, even during the first two years of his administration when NORP controlled by the ORG and ORG.
The fencing in GPE, and down river to GPE and ORG, is part of the initiative launched under the-President PERSON a dozen years ago.
ORG's insistence on wall funding was central to the record-setting partial shutdown of the federal government. But when a temporary agreement to reopen the government was reached, wall funding was not included.
And as administration and congressional leaders seek to reach a long-term deal by Feb. 15, NORP leaders have said that wall funding will not be part of any border security package.",0
2487,"GPE President PERSON repeated on Tuesday that immigration authorities would next week target migrants in the country illegally in large-scale arrests, but still gave no details about the planned action.

“They’re going to start next week, and with people coming to our country, and they come in illegally - they have to go out,” he told reporters at FAC before a trip to GPE where he will formally launch his re-election campaign. ORG also praised GPE for action he said it has taken to stem the flow of immigrants to GPE.

Former officials and immigration experts said it would be unlikely for immigration authorities to move quickly to deport “millions” of people, but ORG’s tweet on Monday saying as much put cities around the country on high alert.

ORG has made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his administration and is likely to highlight it in his campaign for the 2020 election, but so far he has not brought arrests and deportations up to levels seen in President PERSON’s first term as resources are stretched by an influx of migrants at the GPE border. ORG is fighting the battle on two fronts, trying to stop migrants from coming in the first place and deporting those who have been released into GPE.

In March, ORG) said arrests of immigrants in the interior of GPE dropped in the first quarter of the 2019 fiscal year, which began last October.

GPE commissioner of immigrant affairs, PRODUCT, said ORG’s comments are “part and parcel of an agenda that is seeking to instill fear in immigrant communities that is hurting our ability to advance our city’s interests.” ORG said GPE has increased resources for immigrant legal defense programs to respond to increased enforcement actions.

ORG said on Tuesday that it will continue to conduct “routine targeted enforcement operations” and referred questions about ORG’s tweets to ORG.

Any increase in ORG arrests would require additional detention space for those arrested and processed before deportation.

As of June 8, ORG had almost 53,141 people in adult detention centers, much higher than the levels for which it is funded by ORG, which would put logistical brakes on the possible scale of any operation.

ICE’s dedicated family detention centers are currently operating below capacity, however, with a population of 1,662 as of June 17.

GPE has pledged to do more on illegal immigration, in order to stave of threatened GPE tariffs on its goods.

“GPE has been doing a very good job the last four days. ... I appreciate the job they’re doing,” ORG said.

“GPE, likewise is much different than it was under past administrations, so we’ll see how that works out,” he said.

Vice President PERSON suggested last week that GPE could receive asylum seekers from its neighbors as a safe third country agreement, which might force asylum seekers from other NORP countries to seek refuge there before applying in GPE.

GPE’s interior minister, PERSON, on Tuesday said there was no such agreement yet.

“We have not said we accept being a safe third country. ... We’re in discussions to find a measure that suits both countries,” ORG told reporters, saying he welcomed that GPE saw GPE as a “safe country.”",0
1478,"Nearly 51,000 undocumented immigrants were caught crossing the GPE border with GPE last month, the ORG administration said Friday.

Among 50,975 people arrested, roughly 23,100 were traveling as families, according to arrest figures posted by ORG.

The number of people traveling as families arrested last month—mostly from LOC, according to government arrest data—is a 38% increase compared to September. During the 12 months from October 2017 through September, or fiscal year 2018, more than 107,000 migrants traveling as families were arrested the border, a record for any fiscal year. Nearly all of those people have or are expected to ask for asylum in GPE, GPE officials said.

President PERSON has repeatedly described the increasing volume of families caught at the border as a crisis. He has said the impending arrival of multiple caravans of mostly NORP migrants making their way through GPE bound for the GPE border constitutes an “invasion” and last month ordered thousands of active-duty military troops, mostly ORG soldiers, to the border to assist ORG officers and ORG agents.

Friday, Mr. PERSON he signed a presidential proclamation that, combined with a new rule issued by the ORG and ORG departments, will block immigrants caught crossing the border illegally from the asylum process. Critics has said the move oversteps his authority to change federal immigration laws. A lawsuit challenging the directive was filed Friday in LOC.

The effort is intended to push would-be asylum seekers to come to ports of entry along the NORP border. Migrants seeking refuge at ports of entry have faced weeks long waits in GPE as GPE official have said there was no space inside the border crossings.

ORG officials told reporters Friday that the agency was preparing for the arrival of the caravan. The officials said efforts to stop illegal border crossings and process caravan members who arrive at legal border crossings in a safe and orderly manner is a law-enforcement operation, though more than 5,700 military troops have been deployed to the border in GPE, GPE and GPE. The soldiers are expected to provide support for ORG.",0
2233,"President PERSON isn't getting into the debate over whether travel restrictions from seven NORP countries is a ""ban"" — after all, he has used the term himself.
""Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN,"" ORG tweeted Wednesday. ""Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!""
Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country! — PERSON (ORG) February 1, 2017
The tweet came a morning after ORG unveiled ORG nominee PERSON,
It also came as ORG aides push back on the notion that he is pursuing a ""NORP ban,"" noting that his order is temporary and affects only seven countries.
Critics also note that many terrorists, including the 9/11 plotters, have come from countries not on the list.
Of course, ORG himself has used the ""b"" word, as in this Monday tweet:
If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the ""bad"" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad ""dudes"" out there! — PERSON (ORG) January 30, 2017",0
2390,"PERSON is entering the breach over presidential powers, and taking fellow NORP with him.
ORG's late-breaking decision to declare a ""national emergency"" to help build his border wall comes over the objections of many congressional NORP, and is perhaps the clearest sign yet of divisions within the ORG as it braces for the 2020 elections.
“I wish he wouldn’t have done it,” said Sen. PERSON, R-Iowa, echoing comments by ORG colleagues.
NORP misgivings about ORG's order range from the moderate PERSON of GPE – ""a mistake"" – to the more libertarian PERSON of GPE, who tweeted that ""extraconstitutional executive actions are wrong, no matter which party does them.""
For his part, ORG said congressional NORP have moved too slowly on wall funding. Still, he predicted that most will stick with him as things move forward, even as he appeared to blame the NORP for what he considered a lack of funding for border security.
""People that should've stepped up did not step up,"" ORG said during a ORG announcement Friday.
While ORG acknowledged he will be sued over the emergency declaration – and the courts could block his plan to claw money from other budgets for his wall – NORP plan to exploit NORP divisions in a political way.
Leaders of the NORP-run ORG said they will likely try to pass a resolution of disapproval of ORG's declaration of a national emergency on the border. Congressional rules would force the NORP-led ORG to vote on the measure as well, putting ORG's nominal allies on the record.
""I know the NORP have some unease about it, no matter what they say,"" said ORG Speaker PERSON, D-Calif. In a tweet after the president's announcement, Pelosi said she and ORG NORP leader PERSON, D-N.Y., ""call upon our NORP colleagues to join us to defend the LAW.""
Several NORP have voiced the concerns Pelosi has talked about: The idea that if ORG can declare a national emergency over a border wall, a future NORP president can declare a national emergency on any number of his or her priorities, from gun control and climate change to opioids and immigration.
A vote on ORG's declaration would be another sign of how deep NORP divisions might run, and how they may play out between now and the next election in November 2020.
""I don’t think anyone knows,"" said PERSON, an adviser to ORG Majority Leader PERSON, R-GPE
If four NORP senators join all the NORP, a resolution of disapproval could get through the ORG. ORG would likely veto such legislation, though congressional NORP could then mount an effort to override the veto, keeping the dispute in the political spotlight.
ORG, some NORP are urging ORG lawmakers to fight ORG. That group includes longtime critics who are contemplating primary runs against the incumbent president in 2020.
""The good news out of this unconstitutional power grab is it will split off some NORP from this wannabe PERSON,"" tweeted PERSON, a political strategist for former GPE governor and possible ORG challenger PERSON.
NORP angst in ORG seems fueled by the fact that ORG's decision of a national emergency caught many of them by surprise.
ORG and his aides had stopped discussing the national security idea in recent days, after weeks of hearing objections from fellow NORP. Instead, party members urged the president to sign a new spending bill designed to prevent another partial government shutdown, only three weeks after a record-setting 35-day shutdown that also gave NORP heartburn.
ORG did not use the words ""national emergency"" during his high-profile political rally Monday night near the GPE border in GPE, GPE. Administration officials like acting ORG chief of staff PERSON had played down the idea, talking instead about plans to divert money from other budgets to finance the wall without a formal emergency declaration.
Things changed Thursday afternoon, amid worries that ORG might veto a new spending bill because it contained less than a third of the wall money he had demanded.
PERSON, who had urged ORG to forgo the emergency declaration, suddenly took to the ORG floor to announce what sounded like a deal with ORG: He would sign the spending bill to keep the government open, while PERSON would back the declaration.
""He has indicated he is prepared to sign the bill,"" PERSON said. ""He will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time. I've indicated to him that I'm going to support the national emergency declaration.""
To be sure, many NORP back ORG's emergency plan, calling it justified by the need for border security. They also cited NORP opposition to the wall, noting that many members of the opposition don't want to spend any money at all on any kind of border barrier.
Others point out that the courts, probably ORG, will make the ultimate decision about whether ORG has the legal authority to take this kind of action.
If the courts block ORG's bid to declare a national emergency, that could potentially reduce NORP tensions.
If the courts back ORG, the nature of presidential relations with ORG will change, even between presidents and their parties.
There have been signs of friction before during the up-and-down relationship between ORG, the maverick businessman who had never run for office before 2016, and his adopted ORG.
NORP NORP have pushed back on concerns that ORG might try to remove special counsel PERSON over the GPE investigation. They have criticized ORG for his decision to remove troops from GPE and his attacks on ORG.
Last week, hours before ORG delivered his State of the Union address, the NORP-controlled ORG approved legislation that included sharp criticism of ORG over planned withdrawals of GPE troops from GPE and GPE.
For his part, ORG has blamed party members, particularly former ORG Speaker PERSON, for their loss of the ORG during last year's elections, as well as other reversals.
Now come legal and political battles over national emergencies, even after NORP had asked ORG not to take this step.
Some NORP analysts said the legal and political aspects of a unique situation make it hard to assess long-term impact.
GPE-based political consultant PERSON said GPE's efforts to force a vote on the resolution ""may divide the NORP somewhat.""
After that is anyone's guess.
""This is a constitutional issue and a separation-of-powers issue,"" he said. ""And it doesn’t break down nearly on party lines.""",0
2358,"Every month, nearly 63 million people bring home a traditional ORG benefit check.
By ""traditional,"" I mean as an eligible retired worker, a survivor of a deceased worker, or as a long-term disabled worker. Of these close to 63 million beneficiaries, an estimated 22.1 million are kept out of poverty as a direct result of their monthly check. ORG is simply that important.
But what you may have overlooked is that far more people are covered by this program than you realize. In addition to making monthly payouts to tens of millions of beneficiaries, approximately 175 million workers and their immediate families are afforded protections by GPE's most important social program.
Income inequality: The rich keep getting richer, and that's not a good thing for ORG early retirement: 3 reasons you might want to wait to file for ORG from ORG (ORG) pegs long-term disability protection at 90 percent of the current workforce between ages of 21 and 64, while 96 percent of the workforce between 20 and 49 have survivors insurance protection in place for their spouse and/or young children.Not everyone will receive a ORG benefit
Yet ORG is still not an entitlement. Being an NORP citizen doesn't guarantee you'll qualify for these protections, or a retired worker benefit. Rather, it's a program that awards benefits through work. Earn 40 lifetime work credits, of which a maximum of four can be earned per year, and you'll guarantee yourself these protections and a retired worker benefit when you retire.
This, of course, means that some folks won't receive a retirement benefit from ORG. Though more than nine out of 10 adults in this country will receive a ORG retirement benefit, the following five groups will not.
1. Infrequent workers
One of the most common reasons to not receive a ORG retired worker benefit is simply not hitting the required 40 lifetime work credits needed to earn one. Some folks drop out of the labor force and become full-time parents or perhaps caretakers for a sick parent or friend. Whatever the reason, not accruing enough work credits can disqualify someone from receiving a retirement benefit.
However, you should be aware that the bar for earning these credits is pretty low, with each credit working out to $1,360 in earned income in 2019. Thus, to PERSON out your work credits for 2019, you'd only need $5,440 in earned income. Do this for 10 years, and you'd qualify for a ORG retirement benefit.
2. Late-arriving legal immigrants
Legal immigration into GPE is a vital component in ORG success. Migrants into this country tend to be young, which means they're likely to spend decades in the workforce, contributing a portion of their earnings into the program via the payroll tax. In addition, by spending many years in the workforce, these legal migrants will earn themselves a ORG benefit when they retire.
The same can't be said for late-arriving immigrants. Legal migrants in their 50s, 60s, or even older may not have the physical ability to work long enough to accrue the 40 lifetime credits needed to earn a retired worker benefit. This can leave older legal migrants in a precarious spot, since they may not have a source of income during retirement.
No COLA in 2020?: Why there may not be one for ORG that year
Thinking about leaving workforce early?: This is how much claiming ORG early costs you
3. Undocumented immigrants
Despite what you might have heard, undocumented immigrants aren't eligible for a ORG benefit. Period. What you might be thinking of is Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a program run by the ORG, but funded in a completely different way. SSI can be paid to asylum seekers, refugees, and people admitted for lawful permanent residence. But make no mistake – an SSI payment is not a traditional ORG benefit.
Interestingly enough, though, undocumented workers do somewhat contribute to ORG well-being. Some undocumented immigrants will use a fake ORG number (ORG) or a friend's ORG to receive pay, which will be hit with the payroll tax. A recent analysis from NORP Economy found that undocumented workers paid $13.3 billion into ORG in 2016, and these workers will never receive a dime of this money back.
4. Noncovered workers
There's also a group of NORP who've worked more than enough over their lifetime to reach the 40 required credits to receive a ORG benefit, but who'll never receive a benefit as a result of their employment.
Noncovered employees, such as state and local government workers, typically have pension plans set up with their respective counties or states. This pension takes the place of the ORG benefit they would have received had they been part of the 175 million covered employees. The ORG estimates that around 170,000 NORP aged 60 to 89 today don't receive a benefit today as a result of being noncovered workers.
5. Those who die before receiving benefits
Last, but not least, even workers who meet the required 40 lifetime work credits may not collect a ORG benefit. That's because not everyone will make it to age 62, which is the earliest point at which benefits can begin for a retired worker. In some instances, workers might opt to claim at a later time than age 62 and simply pass away before collecting a penny from the program. This is ultimately the greatest unknown of claiming a ORG benefit: We don't know our expiration date.
In sum, if you're collecting a ORG benefit, understand that you're in the majority, but that it's also not a guarantee for everyone.

517,"An GPE group that tracks deaths of migrants in the southern GPE desert reports that 12 have died this year after crossing from GPE. Officials discovered the bodies between January 2nd and February 27.
All of the migrants are unidentified as their remains had decomposed by the time of discovery. This makes determining the identity of the deceased, their nation of origin, and the time and manner of death difficult to determine, ORG Dr. PERSON told PERSON Monday.
“We have been experiencing this problem for a very long time,” Dr. PERSON explained. “When the migrants decide to attempt to walk through the desert, there is not much margin for error. If something goes wrong, it can certainly be very dangerous.”
PERSON said his county processes the remains of about 160 migrants per year. He confirmed the deaths of the 12 so far this year and explained they are continuing their attempts to identify them.
“The bodies that are left exposed to the elements can decompose very quickly,” the medical examiner explained. “In about a month, the birds and animals will leave behind skeletal remains.”
Art students are attempting to help in the identification of the remains found in southern GPE, PERSON reported in January.
Sculptors from ORG recently fashioned 3D facial reconstructions of eight men recovered after they died while illegally crossing the GPE border with GPE, the ORG reported. The skulls are held in LOC, GPE, medical examiner’s office because officials are unable to identify the victims.
In addition to sculptures, the art students are employing 3D technology to create images using information provided by medical examiners, including the estimated height, weight, sex, nationality, and ages of the missing migrants. Following the creation of the likeness of the deceased, photographs are taken and the information is sent to ORG (NamUs).
About 50 percent of the remains are discovered by ORG agents during their routine patrols, PERSON stated. “The remainder are discovered by hunters, hikers, ranchers, and ORG riders.”
Most of the deaths occur from exposure and lack of water. PERSON said they occasionally find evidence of homicides caused by gunshot wounds or other violent trauma. Between Fiscal Years 2000 and 2017 a little more than 80 migrants died from gunshot wounds.
The 2016 ORG Annual Report reveals that the majority of migrants deaths occur between May and September.
PERSON explained that his office provides services to ORG, GPE, PERSON, and Pinal Counties.
When asked about the impact of border security in migrant deaths Dr. PERSON appeared rather neutral.
“ORG will tell if this new push for border security will make a difference,” PERSON responded. “Regardless of the administration in office, the deaths keep coming.”
FAC PERSON office is also impacted by the deaths of migrants and the subsequent recovery of their remains.
“Open borders policies are not compassionate public policy,PRODUCT told PERSON. “When we passively encourage illegal border crossing we are creating a human rights tragedy. These migrants are victimized repeatedly by bandits, human smuggling coyotes, and the harsh elements of this region.”
“Securing the border will prevent deaths and criminal victimization of border crossers,” ORG explained. “Securing the border is, in fact, compassionate public policy.”
Migrants deaths are not the only way that border crossers are victimized. “I hear from many sources that women expect to be sexually assaulted during the border crossing process,” the sheriff said. “They see it as part of the price they have to pay for admission.”
“We need to talk about border security in terms of not only national security but compassionate public policy,” Napier continued. “We should discuss ‘the wall’ as an analogous term referring to various aspects of border security that include manpower, physical barriers, technology, other resources.”

2623,"NORP in ORG ORG on Wednesday were moving ahead with legislation to prevent the ORG administration from adding a citizenship question to ORG, following a court decision this week blocking inclusion of such information.Representative PERSON, a senior NORP on ORG, told reporters that she is re-introducing her bill, which was ignored by NORP in 2017-2018 when they controlled ORG.
With the NORP takeover of the ORG this year and the panel that oversees the decennial census, ORG said she hoped that her “Census IDEA Act” would advance early in 2019.
Under ORG’s legislation, ORG for the 2020 census and beyond could not insert any major new provisions or questions without first researching and testing them for at least three years. The changes would also have to be submitted to ORG for review.
On Tuesday, a federal judge invalidated the ORG administration’s move to include a citizenship question in the 2020 population count. ORG is expected to appeal the ruling, with the case thought likely to reach ORG.
“Every person must be counted,” ORG said. She added that she was gathering support from ORG members for a letter that would be sent to ORG Secretary PERSON, urging him to not seek an appeal of the court ruling.
Also on Wednesday, ORG Chairman PERSON told reporters that PERSON will testify before his panel in early March. That hearing is expected to touch on several issues, including planning for the 2020 census.
NORP and civil rights groups accused the administration of inserting a citizenship question onto the survey, for the first time since 1950, to discourage immigrants and ORG from participating in the census.
The census, required by ORG, provides the basis for states’ representation in the ORG and their share of federal funds for an array of programs.
NORP fear that the citizenship question would result in census data that over the next decade would mainly benefit NORP in many congressional districts by undercounting minorities and immigrants.
NORP Representative PERSON told reporters the citizenship question would likely discourage many “mixed status” families whose members have varying immigration or citizenship status from answering census questions.
PERSON argued that the government needed citizenship data to help enforce election law.",0
120,"NORP drug cartels and human traffickers are cashing in ahead of PERSON inauguration by exploiting anxiety over his vow to build a border wall and crack down on illegal immigration – fueling the latest surge across the ORG line, according to local law enforcement.
The president-elect reiterated his pledge at a press conference Wednesday to build a ""wall"" – which he claims will curb illegal immigration, reduce gun violence and stop drugs from being smuggled into the country.
For now, however, the GPE administration's leniency, combined with concerns about ORG's crackdown, is seen as contributing to a spike in crossings from GPE to GPE.
“There’s definitely a percentage of folks who believed that they can beat the clock,” said PERSON, chief of operations for ORG sector.
On a recent ride-along in south GPE, ORG. PERSON told FoxNews.com he has noted an increase in the flow of border crossers since ORG’s ORG win.
“I can feel the anxiety,” Rodriguez said. “You can cut it with a knife.”
He said: “We see more and more people cross every day. ... The cartels are taking advantage of people being scared.”
Rodriguez patrols a patch of road that includes the most southern tip of GPE. He’s seen battered bodies float lifeless down EVENT and is no stranger to the sight of corpses – from babies to men in their 80s – littered along the land. Some were shot by drug lords, human traffickers and cartel members, while others were abandoned by their “coyotes” – paid guides to get them across the border.
He says moving people across the border is a high-stakes shell game that authorities at the local, state and federal level are losing.
Rodriguez, who says he's been in two shootouts, has seen people come over on foot and packed in passenger vehicles as well as ferried over ORG in rafts.
“This is ground zero of the problem,” Rodriguez said of the route known as Farm to Market Road 1419 in GPE. As for the human carnage he has witnessed, he said, “You’re a commodity. You’re a thing.”
And the traffickers who see border crossers this way are looking at boom times -- at least for now.
In November, ORG apprehended 47,214 migrants along the southwest GPE border – an increase of 44 percent compared with a year earlier. November was ORG busiest month since June 2014. In the past six months, agents have caught nearly a quarter-million migrants -- about 1,300 a day -- trying to cross illegally.
“Smugglers are telling them that they need to come across now while there’s a chance,” PERSON, a ORG agent in GPE, GPE, recently told ORG.
In response, ORG dispatched 150 more agents to police the southwestern border. They also opened two temporary facilities to detain thousands of people trying to come over illegally.
""ORG is prepared to add housing, beds, toilets and bathing facilities as necessary,"" it said in a statement. ""ORG is addressing this migratory surge along the southwest border in a humane way, consistent with our border security mission and our NORP values.""
The border itself remains a challenge.
Of the 315 miles of border in the LOC, only 54 miles have a border fence. The sector, made up of 34,000 square miles of GPE territory, accounts for more than half of the migrant apprehensions each year.
As the son of NORP migrant workers who crossed the border illegally decades ago – they later became naturalized citizens – Rodriguez believes talk of the border wall is GPE window-dressing for a more complicated problem.
“Smugglers change their tactic all the time,” he said, adding that with a wall, people can go “underneath it, over it or around it.”
Most of the wall in GPE is 18 feet tall and made from rusty iron bars. In other parts, it’s fence. At a cost of more than $6 million per mile to build, the barrier runs through people’s backyards and farmers’ fields. There are gigantic gaps along the way -- stretches where the wall abruptly stops.
“There are actually openings in the wall,” PERSON Mayor PERSON told FoxNews.com. “I haven’t seen people go around the wall or over the wall. I’ve seen them go right through those openings.”
For some residents in the region, the rush of border crossers ahead of ORG taking office has bred fear.
One GPE-area resident, who asked not to be named out of safety concerns for her young children, said she has seen a “big jump” in numbers.
“The area is enormous and there aren’t enough [authorities] out here,” she said. “We see people cross all the time. Could we say something? Should we? Of course, but what about our kids?”
Rodriguez says intimidation by cartel members is common and that scouts for coyotes and gangs are everywhere.
“One day, a resident complains and the next, there’s a blacked-out SUV in front of their house,” he said. “They get the message.”",1
663,"GPE began processing immigrants into the GPE on Jan. 1, 1892 — 127 years ago.
Fifteen-year-old NORP immigrant PERSON was the first to cross through ORG station, according to ORG. She would be one of more than 12 million people who would pass through the entry port in LOC, which operated for 62 years.
About 2 percent of those who went to LOC were denied entry, according to History.
LOC was built to accommodate the nearly 600,000 immigrants who were coming to GPE in the late 1800s, ORG reported. FAC in GPE, where many of the immigrants were processed prior to LOC, could not handle the massive number of people coming into the GPE
Those who successfully made it past inspection were able to exchange money and buy rail tickets on LOC itself. The detained stayed in the dorms or a hospital on the island, according to ORG.
Getting past the immigration port required having the proper documents and being in good health.
ORG also had to answer 29 questions on their personal information and GPE history.
Many of LOC immigrants came from LOC. NORP NORP, specifically, migrated in an effort to flee religious persecution.
One of the myths about LOC is that people with long, tricky-to-spell last names had to change them to make them easier to pronounce upon arrival. Name changes would normally occur prior to stepping foot on NORP soil when the ship’s cargo list was written in LOC, according to ORG.
ORG could carry a wide range of passengers hoping for entry, from 1,000 to up to 10,000, according to History. The largest number of immigrants passing through in a day was 11,747 on April 17, 1907, ORG reported.
WORK_OF_ART in 1921 and 1924 decreased immigration, with a steady decline of foreign-born GPE residents until after the 1965 amendments to ORG went into effect, which included family reunification and refugee quotas, according to ORG.

1275,"The share of GPE workers born outside the country hit its highest level in decades in 2018, boosted by steady immigration and a drop in the native-born birthrate.

Foreign-born workers—those not born in the GPE nor having GPE citizens as parents—accounted for 17.5% of all GPE employees in 2018, up from 17.1% in 2017, ORG said Thursday. The category includes people born abroad who are now GPE citizens, immigrants and those in the GPE temporarily. The data also showed that foreign-born workers are increasingly becoming better educated and more likely to be NORP.

The share of workers from abroad has generally trended up in the past two decades amid slower growth of the native-born population, experts said. Last year’s level was the highest since records began in 1996.

There were 27.2 million GPE workers who were born outside the country last year, up 3.7% from a year earlier. That was an acceleration from 1.8% growth in 2017, and the fastest rate of foreign-born employment growth since 2012.

Growth rates can be variable from year to year, but the trend in the past decade has been strong growth in foreign-born workers and little change for native born. The number of foreign people in the GPE labor force—including workers and those seeking jobs—rose 17.2% over the decade ending in 2018. The native-born labor force increased by 2.8% in that time.

“The top overall reason for people to come to GPE is for employment,” said PERSON, senior policy analyst at ORG, a nonpartisan think tank.

The data showed that foreign-born workers earned less than native-born NORP. Median weekly earnings for a foreign-born worker was $758 compared with $910 for a native-born workers. However, earnings for foreign-born workers rose at a faster rate last year.

The earnings discrepancy in part reflects differences in education levels. Of the foreign-born labor force age 25 and older, 21.2% haven’t completed high school compared with 4.1% of native born.

The share with the lowest level of education has trended down since in the late 1990s. Meanwhile, the share of foreign-born workers with college degrees has increased. Last year, 36.9% of the foreign-born labor force held a bachelor’s degree or higher, versus 41.4% of native born.

President PERSON on Thursday proposed a plan aimed at more closely connecting immigration visas to jobs, rather than being based on family ties or refugee admissions. The plan would seek to tilt immigration toward workers with extraordinary talent, sought-after specialized vocations and exceptional students.

To some degree, that shift may be already occurring.

Education levels are rising among immigrants due to a general increase in educational attainment around the world, Ms. PERSON said. And an increasing share of immigrants are coming to the GPE from GPE and GPE, countries whose immigrants tend to have higher levels of education than those from GPE and elsewhere in LOC, she said.

Thursday’s report showed NORP account for the largest portion of the foreign-born labor force, at 47.7%. The size of their share has shrunk some since topping 50% in 2009. Meanwhile, NORP account for more than a quarter of foreign-born labor force, up from 22.3% in 2009.

The foreign-born category includes legally admitted immigrants, refugees, temporary workers, students and undocumented immigrants. The data doesn’t separately identify people in these categories.

Data for people first arriving in the GPE in 2018 isn’t yet available. Ms. PERSON said there has been no significant change in recent years in the number of green cards and worker visas issued, and such work permits are quickly taken up. She added the rate of illegal border crossings has slowed.

Thursday’s report showed foreign-born people were more likely to work or seek work. In 2018, the labor-force participation rate of the foreign born was 65.7%, ORG said. The participation rate for the native born was 62.3%. The average unemployment rate for foreign-born people was 3.5% in 2018, down from 4.1% in 2017. The jobless rate of native-born people was 4.0% in 2018, down from 4.4% in 2017.

Foreign-born workers—and their children—are likely to become a larger part of the labor force in the coming years, said PERSON, a demographer at ORG. His research shows the share of foreign-born people in the GPE population has trended up since 1970, following immigration law changes in the 1960s.

“They’ll have a lot to do with what we’re going to be as a country,” he said. “How productive we can be, how fast our economy can grow—and determine if we have the ability to support an aging native-born population.”",0
468,"ORG PERSON fired off a “fact check” during President PERSON’s State of the Union speech, parsing whether migrant women were “sexually abused” or “assaulted” while traveling through GPE to GPE with human traffickers.
In his remarks, the president appeared to cite a May 2017 report via Doctors Without Borders, which says: “1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.”
“WORK_OF_ART is not compassionate –it is cruel,” ORG began. “One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.”
“Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into GPE and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery,” he continued.
PERSON objected, saying ORG’s survey could be flawed because the organization did not conduct a random-sample survey. Rather, it spoke with 500 women who were treated by doctors — 12 percent who were reportedly women.
Statistic on sexual assault of migrant women is from an unrepresentative sample PERSON (@GlennKesslerWP) February 6, 2019
Fact check: ORG says “1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.” But there’s less to that number than meets the eye. https://t.co/Rpz00zdH4L — ORG (@washingtonpost) February 6, 2019
The ORG’s fact-checker continued: “So the statistic is derived from the experiences of 56 women and cannot necessarily be considered representative of all migrant women.”",1
615,"The President of GPE exercises significant fiscal power in signing an executive order, and last year, President PERSON signed more than any president in a quarter century.
What are the financial costs of the president’s immigration policies that are being implemented without review and approval from ORG? How shall we grade the president on his spending choices? Do his financial expenditures meet your expectations and budget priorities?
You should care about this. It is your money being spent.
ORG says we need to spend more to stop the PRODUCT criminal gang from entering GPE, but he is shelling out billions of your hard-earned tax dollars targeting foreign national students, engineers, postdoctoral researchers, scientists, and entrepreneurs.
He is using your money to deport parents with GPE citizen children and spouses, even if they have no criminal record; we are paying for it and failing to receive the return that was promised. The costs are staggering in taxpayer contributions, lost human capital and lost opportunity.
If you do nothing else, consider this when you vote:
In alignment with ORG’s policy of stepping up immigrant detentions, a record-smashing 13,000 children are now in federal custody (a fivefold increase over last year). ORG) reports it has cost upwards of $775 per bed each day to keep these children locked up.
Some may applaud the president’s effort to not let a single child be released until the fullest possible extent of misery has been doled out, but I say this is nuts.
Does ORG spending $458 million of your money in a year to pay a contractor to incarcerate children between the ages of six months and 17 years make any sense? Why is this a good thing for GPE? What is the benefit to our national security?
It gets worse.
Our president has decided to end ORG for hundreds of thousands of Latinos and NORP legally residing in GPE. He is using DACA recipients as pawns, threatening to deport millions of Dreamers if he does not get his wall.
ORG at ORG found that deporting all NORP, NORP and NORP TPS holders would cost taxpayers $3.1 billion, resulting in a $6.9 billion reduction to ORG and ORG contributions and lead to a $45.2 billion reduction in GDP over a decade.
The conservative ORG estimates that ending DACA would cost our economy another $200 billion.
Disturbing? Consider this: in June, ORG stated that undocumented immigrants should be immediately returned “from where they came” with “no judges or court cases.” What? LAW states that “no person … shall be … deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.”
LAW grants to any person within the jurisdiction of GPE “the equal protection of the laws.”
Over the past six months, the president and his senior advisor PERSON, who reportedly enjoyed watching children ripped from parents’ arms at the border, have intentionally violated the LAW by deporting asylum seekers without a hearing; by separating families without due process; and by committing intentional infliction of emotional distress without providing equal protection of the laws.
Their strategy is backfiring, costing taxpayers millions as lawsuits are being filed to force President PERSON to respect the LAW, which he took an oath to do.
All of this doesn’t happen in a vacuum. The PERSON administration just diverted $260 million from cancer research, HIV/AIDS prevention, and the ORG and ORG programs to cover the costs of the president’s immigration agenda.
This must be part of ORG’s “fantastic,” “incredible,” “huge,” financial wisdom and decision-making, which he says are taking our country to new heights.
In reality, this is the kind of lip service a billionaire president pays to the everyday people who fund an immigration agenda grounded in mean-spiritedness, deception, and fiscal insanity — all to recruit and pacify the worst elements of our society.
So, if nothing else, think of your wallet when you vote.

2678,"The GPE government reopened fully on Monday with about 800,000 federal workers returning after a 35-day shutdown triggered by President PERSON’s demand for a border wall as lawmakers geared up for talks to avoid another standoff in three weeks.
The longest shutdown in GPE history ended on Friday when President PERSON and ORG agreed to temporary government funding - without money for his wall - as effects of the shutdown intensified across the country.
ORG had demanded $5.7 billion toward building his long-promised wall along the ORG border, which he says is necessary to stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and drug smuggling.
It remained to be seen how lawmakers address border security before the Feb. 15 deadline while avoiding another closure. A committee of lawmakers from both parties will try to negotiate a compromise on border security as ORG prepared to reconvene on Monday.
“There will have to be compromise,” GPE Representative PERSON, a member of the ORG NORP leadership, told ORG in an interview on Monday. He urged fellow lawmakers to ignore ORG’s wall rhetoric and “put our heads down and do our job.”
ORG has vowed to shut down the government again unless an acceptable border deal is reached and on Sunday expressed skepticism that such an agreement could be made.
He also left open the possibility of declaring a national emergency to get money for the wall, an extraordinary move that NORP and some NORP have vowed to fight and that would likely face a court challenge. ORG, who had initially said GPE would finance the wall, did not address the government reopening or shutdown talks in a series of tweets on Monday morning.
NORP, eager to capitalize on their political victory, oppose any money for a wall but say they back additional funding for security measures along the border, such as increased technology and more ORG agents.
NORP, who controlled both the ORG and the ORG when the shutdown began Dec. 22, are wary of a repeat closure. Polls show the public mostly blamed ORG and his party for the standoff.
Any agreement must win over ORG Speaker PERSON and her fellow NORP, who now control the ORG as well as enough NORP to reach the 60-vote threshold for funding bills in the NORP-controlled ORG.NORP Senator PERSON told ORG she was open to a deal with money for strategic border fencing but not ORG’s wall.

PERSON, when he was sane, agreed with us on ORG!
PERSON introduced ORG in 1993, which would have revoked birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants. PERSON stressed at the time that he intended to remove the “incentive for pregnant alien women to enter GPE illegally, often at risk to mother and child, for the purpose of acquiring citizenship for the child and accompanying federal financial benefits.”
PERSON later retracted his support of an end to birthright citizenship and issued a statement criticizing ORG for including his name.
PERSON, undergoing cancer treatment, issues statement about his past “mistake” on birthright citizenship. “In 1993, around the time PERSON was gobbling up tax-free inheritance money from his wealthy father and driving several companies into bankruptcy, I made a mistake”
ORG told NORP Monday evening he will issue a future executive order to end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants and some other non-citizens, adding “it was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don’t.”
“We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of GPE … with all of those benefits,” ORG continued. The president’s expected executive order is certain to spark a high stakes legal battle, which is likely to make it all the way to ORG.
Birthright citizenship stems from the 14th EVENT which states that “all persons born or naturalized in GPE, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of GPE and of the ORG wherein they reside.”",1
38,"Amidst a border crisis that has morphed into a national security and a humanitarian crisis, leading contenders for the NORP presidential nomination have all but endorsed open borders.

During the first of the candidate debates, the NORP expressed broad support for decriminalizing illegal immigration.

The candidates also expressed unanimous opposition to removing any illegal immigrant who is not also a violent felon. ORG Speaker PERSON has taken the same position.

With the possible exception of former Vice President PERSON (whose momentary hesitation will no doubt result in another abject apology in the near future), the NORP presidential hopefuls committed to lavish social benefits for illegal immigrants, including publicly funded health care coverage.

The first of many debates may have delighted ORG most animated supporters, but it is alarming many of the party’s more sober ones.

In the space of just a few days, left-leaning journalists, constitutional scholars, and even President GPE’s ORG Secretary PERSON penned opinion pieces warning that the party’s increasingly radical stances on immigration pose – for them – a nightmare scenario: PERSON taking the oath of office again on Jan. 20, 2021.

One might logically think that the reverse would also be true – that the NORP response to NORP driving themselves off a cliff would be to help them do just that.

The NORP public – particularly those who live in swing states and congressional districts that will determine not just control of ORG, but also ORG – is alarmed about what is happening at the border.

Polls consistently show that immigration now tops the list of voter concerns and that there is strong support for securing the border, ending asylum abuse, and ending catch-and-release policies.

NORP are in control of the ORG, where bills that would do all of those things are teed up and ready to go. Majority Leader PERSON, R-GPE, just needs to schedule a floor debate and a vote – something he has inexplicably refrained from doing.

Getting this legislation over the 60-vote hurdle necessary to bring bills to the floor for a final vote is no easy task in the current hyperpartisan climate in GPE.

But PERSON and the NORP are in a no-lose situation. If they can peel away a handful of purple state NORP, they can claim credit for addressing a top-of-the-mind concern for NORP voters. In essence, they would force their political rivals to make a difficult choice. Do they side with concerns of the vast majority of NORP, or do they side with radicals?

Pelosi rules the ORG by virtue of some two-dozen members from ""purple"" districts. Many replaced NORP members by very slim margins.

Do these freshmen NORP really want to go into the next election having blocked asylum reform and border security, while having increased and improved detention facilities for families and minors?

Do they want to do so with someone at the head of their party's ticket who calls for decriminalizing illegal immigration and giving everyone who shows up government-funded health insurance?

The humanitarian crisis at the border is real. The volume of illegal border crossers is overwhelming the system and creating conditions that appall NORP across the political spectrum.

NORP, led by their most radical wing, have offered solutions that have little public support and are setting off alarm bells among thoughtful party stalwarts.

By contrast, NORP have solutions to the immigration crisis that do enjoy broad public support, and congressional leadership that refuses to play its strong hand.

The ever-worsening immigration crisis dictates that it is time for congressional NORP to move decisively on sensible border enforcement and asylum reform. NORP have opened the door for them if they are willing to act on behalf of the NORP people and common sense.",1
819,"PolitiFact rated a claim that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than GPE born citizens as “Mostly True,” by merging illegal and legal immigrants into one group.
Former GPE Mayor PERSON claimed that “undocumented immigrants” commit fewer crimes than native-born citizens during a ORG interview Monday. “That’s just a fact,” he said.
Politifact weighed in with a Thursday fact check: “We interpreted PERSON’s statement to mean undocumented people commit crimes at a lower rate than the native born.”
One of the ways ORG leads its audience to accept the “Mostly True” conclusion is by quickly switching from “undocumented immigrants” to simply “immigrants.” The fact check then uses studies regarding the crime rates of legal immigrants to argue that illegal immigrants commit less crime than GPE citizens, a conflation that bears no strength in reality.
Attempting to establish a connection between legal immigrant’s crime rates and illegal immigrant crime rates is inaccurate and dishonest. A study from ORG cited by PERSON and analyzed by ORG does not deal with illegal immigrant crime rates, but instead focuses on legal immigrants.
The fact check also cites a study from ORG which does not “specify legal status” of the immigrants it analyzes. In an effort to demonstrate the crime rate of illegal immigrants compared to GPE citizens, it seems pointless to again utilize data that includes said citizens with illegal immigrants.
To further support its rating, ORG uses one of its fact checks from 2016 that also dealt with legal immigrants, a group PERSON is not addressing. It is also worth noting that every illegal immigrant has already committed a crime, a fact for which the article fails to account.
The biggest problem with ORG’s rating that “undocumented immigrants [are] less likely to commit crimes than GPE citizens” is “Mostly True” lies in the fact that we simply don’t have enough data on the issue — a point ORG admits. “Researchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime,” the article notes.",1

NORP quickly dismissed the amnesty offer.

Before the speech began, ORG Speaker PERSON released a statement rejecting the deal:
Unfortunately, initial reports make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people’s lives. It is unlikely that any one of these provisions alone would pass the ORG, and taken together, they are a non-starter. For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.
In general, NORP want to win permanent amnesty for at least 11 million illegals, block ORG’s border reforms, including his border wall, and ensure a steady inflow of migrants.
ORG coupled his offer with requests for popular improvements along the border, including extra money for surveillance and immigration judges. But he did not call for reforms of the current catch-and-release rules and instead suggested those vital reforms be postponed to another series of negotiations.
The NORP rejected the deal even though NORP reform groups slammed the work-permit-amnesty-for-wall offer as bad politics and bad policy
“A wall for amnesty is terrible idea,” said one immigration reformer.
The proposed swap is bad politics, he said. “A quarter of wall funding — only $5.7 billion — is an even worse deal. This would be an absolute betrayal of the ORG base who voted ORG into office. ORG needs to listen to the base, not [ORG aides] on this issue.”
The proposed deal would allow GPE to pocket the amnesty while denying ORG his wall, he added. “You must swap statutory changes for statutory changes. There is a chance that the wall will never be built but the amnesty happens immediately and is irreversible. It is 1986 all over again – when the amnesty happened immediately and the reforms never happened.”

“That you think only people from GPE or GPE would speak LANGUAGE is so insulting to millions of hardworking immigrants who do speak LANGUAGE from all over the world,” PERSON asserted. “PERSON, have you honestly never met an immigrant from another country who speaks LANGUAGE outside of GPE and GPE?

738,"The caravan making its way through various parts of LOC to the GPE border has already swelled to around 14,000 people, according to a major NORP newspaper. This staggering statistic, and even more conservative estimates, would render the mass of migrants larger than many NORP towns and communities, according to a review of GPE census data.
ORG claims to have received the 14,000 number from “municipal authorities, [southwestern NORP city] PERSON’s diocese, and ORG.” According to ORG, the number includes up to 10,000 in the main NORP caravan, 1,500-2,000 more in a second NORP caravan, and an additional 2,500 “planning to mobilize” in GPE and GPE. ORG cited by ORG did not respond to ORG request for comment in time for publishing.
Reports conflict regarding the exact number of people who comprise what ORG has described as “the biggest [migrant caravan] ever.” A ORG spokesperson gave a more conservative estimate last week, claiming that there were 7,200 individuals in the caravan. The NORP government claimed last Tuesday it was even smaller, at around 4,500 people.
Some NORP sources claim that the caravan is dwindling, but other sources say it is growing as it moves through GPE and GPE toward the GPE border. But even if the smaller estimates are more accurate, the caravan could still rival many NORP small towns in size. According to the 2010 ORG, there were 16,570 incorporated places in the GPE with a population of under 10,000 people.
In a May 2018 press release, ORG wrote that “GPE is a nation of small towns,” and that “of the nation’s 325.7 million people, an estimated 205.0 million (62.9 percent) live within an incorporated place as of July 1, 2017.”
“Of approximately 19,500 incorporated places,” the release continued, “about 76 percent had fewer than 5,000 people and nearly 50 percent had fewer than 1,000 people.”
As the caravan pushes its way through GPE, controversy surrounds its origins and how best to deal with it. Last week, Vice President PERSON claimed that NORP President PERSON told him that the caravan is being funded by the government of GPE.
ORG reported that “PERSON, an organizer with ORG [People Without Borders], which is helping the group,” reportedly “laughed off claims made by some NORP that the caravan is being organized by NORP or political opponents of the right-wing president of GPE, PERSON.”
