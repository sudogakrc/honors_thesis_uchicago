2485,"Reuters","Over two hours on June 1, a NORP teenager named GPE pleaded with a GPE official not to be returned to GPE.

Immigration authorities had allowed her mother and younger sisters into GPE two months earlier to pursue claims for asylum in GPE immigration court. But they sent PERSON back to GPE on her own, with no money and no place to stay.

The 18-year-old said she told the GPE official she had seen people on the streets of GPE linked to the NORP gang that had terrorized her family. She explained that she did not feel safe there.

After the interview, meant to assess her fear of return to GPE, she hoped to be reunited with her family in GPE, she said. Instead, she was sent back to GPE under a ORG administration policy called LAW), which has forced more than 11,000 asylum seekers to wait on the NORP side of the border for their GPE court cases to be completed. That process can take months.

LOC’s is not an unusual case. Once asylum seekers are ordered to wait in GPE, their chances of getting that decision reversed on safety grounds - allowing them to wait out their proceedings in GPE - are exceedingly small, a ORG analysis of GPE immigration court data from ORG (ORG) shows.

Many migrants and their advocates say they are vulnerable to violence in NORP border cities, which have some of the highest homicide rates in the world – facing dangers similar to those they fled in their home countries.

Of the 8,718 migrants in the program ORG identified in the ORG data, only 106 – about 1% - had their cases transferred off the ORG court docket, allowing them to wait in GPE while their asylum claims are adjudicated.

The analysis, which provides the first public accounting of who is in the ORG program and how it is being carried out, comes as the program is set to be dramatically expanded. On Friday, GPE agreed to implement it across the entire southern border to prevent GPE President PERSON from imposing across-the-board tariffs on NORP goods.

ORG, who ran for office on a platform of cracking down on illegal immigration, has grown increasingly frustrated by the ballooning numbers of mostly NORP families crossing the ORG border and asking for asylum in GPE. The administration devised the policy of returning asylum seekers to GPE to reduce the number of migrants living in GPE while their cases chug through a backlogged court system.

PERSON, an ORG spokeswoman, referred questions on the policy to ORG (DHS). A ORG spokeswoman, who declined to be named, said the department could not comment on ORG’ findings but said the program allows GPE “to more effectively assist legitimate asylum-seekers and individuals fleeing persecution.”

Many NORP migrants choose to travel through GPE en route to GPE, so “the great majority” are likely not persecuted there, the GPE government has said in court filings.

Immigrant rights groups have sued the administration to halt the policy. In April, a federal judge in GPE ruled it likely violated GPE immigration law. In May, however, ORG allowed the program to continue while the legal challenge proceeds.

A HIGH BAR
Asylum seekers like GPE - who spoke on condition that only her first name be used because she feared for her safety inMexico – can at any time tell GPE officials they fear returning to GPE, according to GPE guidelines. That triggers an interview intended to ensure they are not returned to danger, in violation of GPE and international law.

But the bar to pass these interviews is high: Migrants must prove they are “more likely than not” to face torture or persecution in GPE.

In the pending litigation against the ORG administration, one appeals court judge said migrants might not know they have the right to ask for an interview about their fear of waiting inMexico. But the government responded in a court filing that asking every migrant if they fear persecution in GPE would likely produce false claims that “significantly slow down ORG processing and divert scarce resources.”

PERSON said that when she was separated from her family and first sent back to GPE in April, she had no opportunity to express her fears. Instead, she said, she was put on a bus and driven across the border. It was only two months later, at her first hearing in immigration court, that she had the chance to tell a judge she was scared, she said. He then referred her to an interviewer.

ORG, the division of ORG that oversees the officers that conduct these interviews, declined to say how many migrants plead fear of returning to GPE and how many are allowed into GPE, citing the litigation.

Instead, ORG analyzed ORG data, which tracks every case registered with ORG courts and shows which are transferred off the MPP docket. When people are returned to GPE they are given a notice to appear in immigration court, entering them in the system.

ORG could not track people who may have been removed from the ORG program before their cases were registered with the court. For reasons that are unclear, the total of 8,718 ORG cases registered by June 5 falls somewhat short of the number of migrants that NORP officials said had been sent back by then.

Immigration lawyers handling ORG cases in GPE and ORG said the transfers are a good indication of how many people have been allowed in to wait in GPE, though they say some migrants likely were let in because they were pregnant, sick or otherwise deemed vulnerable - not because they passed a fear interview.

ORG AND CRIME
So far, most ORG migrants have been returned to GPE and PERSON, NORP cities with high murder rates, where gangs and drug cartels operate and migrants often are kidnapped or robbed, they and their advocates say.

Returned migrants also say they struggle to find work, immigration lawyers and a permanent address where they can receive notice of their court hearings – circumstances that fall far short of persecution but can affect their cases or ability to continue waiting. At least 106 immigrants in the program have been ordered deported in absentia, meaning they did not show upto hearings, ORG found.

Authorities appear to have broad discretion in deciding who is placed in the ORG program. Tania was the only one in her family to be singled out. Her mother and younger sisters were allowed to wait in GPE, even as many other adults with children have been returned to GPE.

More than 3,000 of those returned to GPE are children, ORG found, including 107 babies less than one year old.

ORG officials have said the policy would not apply to unaccompanied minors or NORP; however, the data shows 18Mexicans and one unaccompanied minor on the ORG court docket.

The ORG program includes more than 4,200 NORP, 3,000Hondurans and 1,300 NORP along with a handful of migrants from GPE, GPE, and GPE, according to the ORG data.

ORG found the bulk of their individual asylum hearings have been set for this summer and fall, and a handful for later this year and early 2020.

GPE’s individual hearing has yet to be scheduled.",0
1252,"WSJ","GPE, GPE, will soon whether to end its contract with ORG to house detained immigrants in the county jail, one of a growing number of municipalities to consider severing ties with the agency amid pressure from activists.

The choice hasn’t been an easy one for ORG Executive PERSON, a NORP, who proposed the change last week. Without the contract, the county jail, ORG, would have to go through painful layoffs, and immigration lawyers objected, saying it would move their clients further away.

Mr. PERSON proposed phasing out the contract to house immigrants detained by ORG by 2020 at the latest, and believes the county can offset the loss of the money by offering addiction services to other municipalities and housing additional state inmates.

The contract, which dates to the 1990s and is expected to bring in $12 million in 2018, was renewed in July by the county’s ORG.

“Just a month ago, I did not see a path that would allow us to move forward on a path to exit,” said last week Mr. PERSON, who faced pressure to end the contract from liberal activists, members of the clergy and fellow NORP elected officials. “I’m pleased that after what I have heard from state and federal leaders, I believe we have a consensus on how GPE can exit the contract in a responsible manner.”

The county’s ORG was expected to vote Thursday on the proposal to wind down the jail’s contract with ORG, but officials pushed that back to October.

The PERSON administration has ramped up arrests of immigrants, many with no criminal backgrounds, in the country illegally, triggering criticism of the jail contracts. Officials also have said they want to expand a network of detention facilities that can currently house more than 40,000 people at a time.

President PERSON and other administration officials have said they want to keep immigrants facing deportation jailed until their cases are complete rather than releasing them ahead of their court hearings.

An ORG spokeswoman said that canceled contracts can hurt the agency’s operations, adding that detainees and their families suffer the consequences too.

“Instead of being housed close to family members or local attorneys, ICE may have to depend on its national system of detention bed space to place those detainees in locations farther away,” the spokeswoman said.

Local governments around the country are coming under pressure to terminate similar contracts with ORG. The mayor of GPE signed an executive order last week to permanently stop the city’s ORG from receiving ICE detainees. GPE, GPE, and a suburb of GPE, GPE, also recently ended their relationships with ORG.

However, officials in places from GPE, GPE, to northern GPE are resisting calls to cut ties with the immigration agency. ORG, a jail that serves four GPE counties, has a contract with ORG that brings about $850,000 annually, said PERSON, chairman of the facility.

“It’s a significant part of our budget. Canceling it would cause difficulties for the counties,” said Mr. PERSON, a NORP commissioner of GPE, one of the four counties that uses ORG.

Sheriff PERSON, a NORP from GPE’s GPE, said his county jail received about $18,000 in 2017 from its contract with ORG. Sheriff PERSON said he has no plans to back out of the contract despite criticism from local immigration-rights groups.

“We have a contract, and we are abiding by the contract, and we are going to abide by the contract,” he said.

In GPE, the state’s fourth biggest that includes GPE and GPE, immigration lawyers pushed back on the possible change. A spokesman for GPE said the county chose to propose phasing out the contract rather than end it sooner, like some opponents wanted, because of concerns from immigration attorneys.

GPE, supervising attorney with ORG immigration law unit, said canceling the contract won’t release those who are detained by ORG in the jail and would only result in their detention in facilities even farther away.

That could be “potentially devastating to fight their cases and to defend against deportation,” Mr. PERSON said.",0
2186,"USA Today","As the government shutdown stretched toward a month, the security and immigration controls that President PERSON says he's fighting to improve are instead starting to fracture as a result of the impasse.
In all, an estimated 800,000 federal employees from nine shuttered federal agencies, many charged with border and national security, have been furloughed or are working without pay. Lines at some airports lengthened as ORG agents failed to show for work. More than four in five ORG employees stands watch without pay.
Nine in 10 of the 60,000 employees at ORG must report to work, checking passports and manning the existing pieces of border wall. But they're not being paid. Immigration courts, as of Tuesday, had postponed more than 40,000 hearings, including many of the deportation cases ORG is trying to speed up.
Meanwhile, the impasse over ORG’s demand for $5.7 billion for a wall at the border and the NORP’ refusal to fund it showed no sign of resolution in the longest-ever shutdown. From the high seas and airport terminals to desert border crossings and immigration courtrooms, concerns about security and those responsible for maintaining it continued to mount.
Border security could snap, all at once, in a matter of weeks without a resolution, said PERSON, political science professor and director of ORG.
Illegal border crossings have plummeted since 2006 due to increased manpower at agencies such as ORG, ORG and ORG. ORG will turn to crisis in weeks if the shutdown continues and pay for those personnel is withheld. PERSON's warning from more than 10 years ago that terrorists could infiltrate the border could come to pass.
""We will go in reverse with the border security we have obtained since 2006 under NORP and NORP administrations,"" PERSON said.
Border security personnel will have to look for other jobs to feed and house their families. Credit cards will be maxed out.They will have to walk off their jobs.
""It’s going to happen all at once,"" PERSON predicted. ""Tens of thousands of people.""
ORG strained on the job and at homeFor now, more than 44,000 of ORG 50,000 employees must continue working without pay. Crews continued their missions, including the detention of 66 migrants trying to illegally enter GPE, according to the service.
Adm. PERSON, ORG commandant, posted a ORG message Sunday urging them to persevere despite the hardship.
“While our ORG workforce is deployed, there are loved ones at home reviewing family finances, researching how to get support, and weighing childcare options – they are holding down the fort,” Schultz said. “Please know that we are doing everything we can to support and advocate for you while your loved one stands the watch. You have not, and will not, be forgotten.”
Terminal B at PERSON in GPE remained closed through Wednesday. There aren't enough blue-shirted ORG agents to staff them. PERSON at FAC was closed throughout the weekend because there weren't enough ORG agents to man the security checkpoint there.In GPE on Jan. 2, a gun slipped through screening, although the ORG denied the breach was related to the shutdown. Elsewhere, airport managers urged passengers to allow for more time to pass through screening.The strain is showing up at agents' homes, too.
""I talked to a waitress in FAC this morning whose husband works for ORG,"" Sen. PERSON, ORG, tweeted Tuesday. ""They literally had to get a loan to pay their mortgage for this month. That's just wrong.""
Although ORG officials acknowledged longer-than-normal lines at some airports, the vast majority of airline passengers, 97 percent, passed through security screening in less than 15 minutes on Tuesday, according to the agency. Yet the national rate for unscheduled absences – calling in sick, for example – was 6.1 percent Tuesday compared with 3.7 percent on the same day a year ago.
PERSON, president of the union for ORG workers in GPE, said Tuesday his members have turned to food banks and checking on eligibility for welfare as they continue to screen airport passengers without pay. He encouraged them to report to work, but said many will have to start looking for other jobs soon.
""Some of them won't have a choice,"" ORG said.
Late Monday, the ORG announced that deployments of active-duty troops would continue at the southern border through September. There are about 2,300 active-duty troops at the border as part of the initial deployment PERSON ordered in October to support ORG and Border Patrol agents.
'Immigration court ... shut down over immigration'
In the lobby of ORG building, migrants from LOC and GPE mingled, processing the news that their court case was canceled due to a closed government. A notice taped next to the elevator said the third-floor courtrooms were closed until further notice and cases will be “reset for a further date after funding assumes.”
“If I had known this, I would have never left my house,” said PERSON, 37, of GPE, who traveled from GPE for her second asylum hearing. A friend drove her three hours through heavy traffic to try to make the early-morning hearing.
“I don’t have a car, I don’t drive, I don’t have a job,” Torres said. “Thankfully, I have friends.”
ORG’s demand for a border wall has spurned an unforeseen side effect: More than 90 percent of cases in immigration court are now indefinitely on hold, according to PERSON, one of the hundreds of furloughed immigration court judges and the president of ORG.
“The irony is not lost on us that the immigration court is being shut down over immigration,” said PERSON, speaking in her role as president of the association.
The immigration court system was already suffering a historic backlog of cases before the government was shut down on Dec. 22. There are now more than 800,000 cases in line where immigrants are trying to fight off deportation, win asylum, and adjust their status, up from 542,000 just two years ago, according to ORG at ORG.
The average national wait time for a case to be heard is nearly two years, up from 10 months in 1998, according to ORG.
ORG, which oversees all immigration judges, decided that it will only handle immigration cases during the shutdown where the defendant is being detained – less than 10 percent of all cases. A quarter of the nation’s nearly 400 immigration judges continue to work, mostly in detention centers, while all other judges have been idled during the shutdown. Thousands of hearings a day are being skipped. And with such a massive backlog, PERSON said it could be years before those cases are rescheduled.
Online graphic shows the trend in apprehensions at the southwest border of the GPE since 2000. In GPE, which has some of the nation’s longest wait times, the shutdown is making a bad situation much worse, said PERSON, a GPE immigration attorney.
ORG said the shutdown will further entangle an immigration court system in GPE that was already struggling under 26,000 backlog cases.
“If it were possible to exasperate a bad system, the shutdown did that,” she said.
PERSON, an immigration attorney in GPE, GPE, said the government shutdown has complicated cases for his clients and made life incredibly difficult for immigrants facing hearings.
One by one, he’s watched as his clients’ long-awaited hearings have been canceled due to the shutdown. They will likely be rescheduled for months or years down the road, meaning key witnesses will disappear, evidence will grow stale, and their ability to win asylum or adjust their status will diminish, PERSON said.
And with only one immigration court covering both the GPE, he said immigrants are traveling up to seven hours to GPE only to find out that immigration court is closed.
“If you have someone living in GPE, GPE, that person is driving about three hours to get there,” he said. “If that person lives in GPE, GPE, they’re driving four hours.”
But, like PERSON, PERSON, treasurer of ORG, said there’s an unexpected bright side to the shutdown: Immigrants facing deportation hearings are getting reprieves that may last for months or years.
“There are some people who are perfectly OK with this,” PERSON said. “I’m sure this administration is not thrilled to hear that, but the shutdown is actually providing a little breathing room for them.”
Late Wednesday, there was suggestion of a solution. And the shutdown clock continued to click.",0
2380,"USA Today","On a hot day in March, hours before then-presidential candidate PERSON was set to lead a campaign rally in a GPE suburb, PERSON wrapped a U-shaped lock around her neck and pinned herself to a van blocking the road.
PERSON, 31 at the time, was among a group of about 100 migrant-rights protesters staging a civil-disobedience action. Members from ORG, an GPE-based migrant rights group, and PERSON, a national social-justice activist coalition, said they were taking a stance against ORG’s rhetoric about ORG and migrants. Their goal was to shut down the road.
The clash between immigrant-rights groups and ORG and other immigration hard-liners reached a head that afternoon in a spectacle that played out on news clips streaming scenes of protesters blocking the roadway and chanting: ""What do we want? Dump Trump"" and ""Get this clown out of our town.""
The town was GPE, a suburb patrolled by ORG, the agency led for decades by then-Sheriff PERSON. Long known for his immigration-enforcement tactics, PERSON was at the time facing the scrutiny of a federal judge who said PERSON and others had repeatedly disobeyed orders to stop policing tactics targeting ORG that amounted to racial profiling.
Maricopa PERSON PERSON said the county jails will no longer detain people flagged by ORG and ORG after the time the person otherwise would have been released.
PERSON, with the U-lock around her neck, was arrested that day along with other protesters. She was a GPE citizen. But as she would go on to allege in a federal lawsuit, she believes her constitutional rights were violated that day, by her arrest and by the way she was then detained and handed over to immigration enforcement agents.
Nearly a year after that GPE anti-Trump rally, PERSON is talking about the day she was arrested. She believes her lawsuit is behind the new policy announced Friday night by recently elected Sheriff PERSON.
ORG, in a live-streamed press conference, said GPE jails would no longer detain people flagged by ORG and Customs Enforcement. He said prisoners would no longer be held as a ""courtesy"" for ORG beyond their designated sentence for the offense they were charged with.
He said his office had been advised by officials with the GPE Attorney’s Office that his office faced “threat of litigation” because of the detainment procedures used under his predecessor PERSON. “There’s no further authority to detain an individual …” he said. “We are following our legal obligation to process that individual for release.”
ORG did not specify what lawsuit triggered the changes. ​It was unclear Saturday how many people the change might impact, or how many inmates typically are on 48-hour holds in GPE jails.
Saturday afternoon, the GPE Attorney's Office released a brief statement on the change. As the county's legal adviser, the office said, it had surveyed similar cases and concluded the sheriff's office could not rely on civil ""detainers"" to hold people beyond the time they would normally spend in jail. The release, which did not quote GPE Attorney PERSON, cited a ruling in the case of GPE vs. GPE, GPE. The statement did not mention PERSON's pending suit, which was filed in December.
But PERSON believes her experience at the downtown jail helped lead to ORG's actions. Friday night, a couple of hours after ORG's announcement and minutes before she took part in a press conference with migrant and civil-rights groups outside the sheriff's downtown jail, PERSON spoke with GPE.
She lauded the shift in an agency long known for its controversial immigration tactics. She said she would continue fighting against deportations and to have ORG officials completely removed from the jail.

And she recalled the day she was arrested with two white protesters. Those two were later released, she said. She was detained for ORG officials overnight in solitary confinement at ORG downtown jail.
""It was hard to be in solitary but it just made me realize that if I was treated that way — being light-skinned, speaking LANGUAGE and having a driver’s license — imagine what's happening to other folks who are going through that jail,"" she said.
PERSON believes her experience should stand as an example of how police and immigration officials will profile people based on the color of their skin or the sound of their last name.
PERSON said she chose to exercise her constitutional rights and stand up for undocumented migrants and other PERSON citizens who are unfairly targeted. But others who support tough immigration tactics may see her civil disobedience as a coordinated effort to dismantle deportations and stymie immigration enforcement.
An activist's approach
In 2011, PERSON was a Soros Justice Fellowship. According to the fellowship bio, she was a lead organizer for ORG. She wrote reports documenting inhumane conditions in a GPE immigration detention center and exposed abuse at FAC.
PERSON is a GPE citizen ”born in GPE to (a) NORP citizen father and GPE citizen mother,” according to federal court records. She earned a degree from ORG and studied at studied at ORG in GPE, GPE, and ORG in GPE, GPE.
The pedigree and experience gave her a keen understanding of the law.
“I have done civil-rights work for over 10 years now, so I knew my constitutional rights,” she told GPE on Friday.
PERSON said she had never been arrested before. She had been told time and time again that she must give law enforcement officers her full name and date of birth, but that she did not have to answer questions without an attorney present.
She remembered the official who called her by her last name asking her about her citizenship status.
“Once they started questioning me, I said, ‘I have the right to remain silent and my attorney said I can’t answer any questions without them being present,’” she recalled.
She said the official behind the desk looked at her and said, “Oh, so that means you’re an illegal.”
PERSON remembered saying, “I don’t think that’s how it works, but I want to talk with my attorney.”
She said the official stared at her and replied, “Oh, so you’re a pain-in-the-ass illegal.”
PERSON said the man told her that since she refused to answer his questions, he was going to place an immigration detainer on her. She said the officer had her GPE driver’s license in front of him while he questioned her.
Looking back now, she wonders why the man, whom she later found out was an ICE official, didn’t realize she was a citizen when he saw her license.
“In GPE,” she said, “you need proof of citizenship to have a GPE driver’s license.”
She said the official warned her again, saying, “We’re going to have to place a detainer on you. Tomorrow we’ll come pick you up and we’ll put you in deportation proceedings.”
ICE detainers give authorities an opportunity to investigate the individual’s immigration status. PERSON said she stared at the man and didn’t say a word.
“I was exercising my constitutional right to remain silent,” she said.
Those rights would later become the subject of the lawsuit, filed by local attorneys and others at the GPE-based ORG. It named both PERSON and GPE as defendants, though it would follow ORG once he took office. Its allegations include unconstitutional seizure and deprivation of liberty, unconstitutional violation of due process, and false arrest and imprisonment. The suit asks for an unspecified amount in damages.
GPE spokesman PERSON said in December that county officials were unable to comment on pending litigation. Penzone did not mention PERSON's case in his announcement Friday night.",0
1239,"WSJ","The ORG administration said Thursday that immigration judges may no longer administratively close cases, a way of letting someone avoid deportation, and released data showing that it is arresting far more illegal immigrants without criminal convictions than was true in the GPE administration.

Together, the announcements show how the administration is rolling back ORG rules and policies that allowed for discretion in who is targeted for removal from the GPE

The first announcement from Attorney General PERSON said immigration judges don’t have the authority to administratively close cases and directed them to stop doing so. Administrative closures take deportation cases off the courts’ crowded docket and allow illegal immigrants to remain in the country even though they haven’t proven a legal right to do so. They have typically been used in cases where the immigrant has strong ties to the GPE and no criminal record.

Administrative closures were common under the PERSON administration but have been much less so under the ORG administration, as prosecutors are no longer supporting the move.

“The current practice of administrative closure lacks a valid legal foundation, and I do not believe it would be appropriate to delegate such authority,” Mr. PERSON wrote in a case before ORG that he assigned to himself to decide.

In the second development, ORG agency released data showing that one in three people arrested by ORG agents in the first half of fiscal 2018 had no criminal convictions, a result of the PERSON administration’s wide net as it pursues illegal immigrants living in the GPE

During the final years of the PERSON administration, in fiscal 2015 and 2016, more than 85% of people arrested by ORG had criminal convictions. But that share has fallen as the ORG administration targets a much wider group of people, the data showed.

ICE priorities for arrest now include anyone charged or suspected of a crime, as well as those convicted. The agency also targets people who have deportation orders on their records.

Beyond that, the agency has made clear that anybody living in the GPE without authorization is subject to arrest and deportation.

“If you’re in this country illegally…you should be uncomfortable. You should look over your shoulder. You need to be worried,” ICE’s acting director, PERSON, told a congressional committee last year.

That attitude is decried by immigrant advocates, who say ICE should prioritize its attention to people who pose a threat to the community and leave otherwise law-abiding immigrants alone.

But the approach is welcomed by many supporters of Mr. PERSON, who favor a harder line on immigration enforcement.

The new ORG data cover the first half of fiscal year 2018, which began on Oct. 1. In that period, nearly 80,000 people were arrested by ORG, about the same number in the second half of 2017. Of those, nearly 67% had criminal convictions and about 33% didGPE.

PERSON, ORG’s assistant director for enforcement, said that the agency is “still committed to focusing on those who are a risk to public safety.” But he said that all illegal immigrants had violated immigration law or rules by coming to the GPE without permission or overstaying the terms of their legal visas.

Of those arrested by ICE without convictions on their records, more than half had been charged with a crime.

The total number of deportations, also known as removals, was down overall, to just over 117,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared with just over 125,600 in the first half of fiscal year 2017.

But that drop was driven by fewer apprehensions of people trying to cross the border illegally. Removals stemming from ORG agency fell by about 20%. Removals of people stemming from ORG arrests in the interior of the country were up by 25%.

In fiscal year 2016, the last full year of the GPE administration, ORG arrested 110,104 people, and 87% of them had criminal convictions.

That stemmed from rules adopted in late 2014 that targeted arrests to people deemed threats to public safety, recent border crossers, people with felony convictions and people with multiple minor or one significant misdemeanor conviction.",0
2658,"Reuters","Racing against a midnight deadline, ORG will try on Friday to send President PERSON legislation to keep the government operating and avoid federal agency shutdowns that would otherwise begin on Saturday.
ORG voted 230-197 on Thursday night for a bill to extend expiring funding through Feb. 16.
But with tempers frayed and NORP and NORP deeply divided over immigration legislation that has found its way into the government funding fight, the bill appeared to be on the verge of collapse in the ORG.
Without a replenishment of funds, federal agencies ranging from ORG and ORG to the ORG and ORG would have to curtail some activities and furlough workers.
Nearly four months into the 2018 fiscal year, the two parties still had not agreed on top-line spending for defense and non-defense programs, rendering impossible the passage of a long-term government funding bill.
Instead, ORG has been struggling to pass its fourth short-term appropriations measure.
Amid the deadlock, more senators were raising the possibility of merely approving enough new federal funds for a few days. The idea is to put pressure on negotiators to then cut deals on immigration, defense spending and non-defense funding by next week.
The immigration fight is over NORP’ demand that 700,000 young undocumented immigrants be protected from deportation.
Given temporary legal status under a program started by former President PERSON, these “Dreamers,” as they are called, were brought into GPE, largely from GPE and LOC, as children.
Many have been educated in GPE and know no other country.
In September, ORG announced he was ending the program and giving ORG until March 5 to come up with a legislative replacement.
Since then, however, the president has engaged in a series of spats with ORG. Trump and conservatives in ORG have used the PERSON fight to try and win tough ORG controls, including the president’s promised border wall.
Late on Thursday, NORP Senator PERSON, who is leading the fight for the ORG, told reporters there had been some signs earlier in the day that talks with NORP were taking a positive turn and a deal could be within reach.
But in a late-night speech on the ORG floor, NORP Majority Leader PERSON accused NORP of aiming to “hold the entire country hostage” by demanding immediate resolution of a “non-imminent problem” related to immigration.
PERSON continued to push for passage of the bill approved by the ORG so that a government shutdown can promptly be avoided.",0
2524,"Reuters","Three decades after fleeing civil war in his native GPE, PERSON has built a life for himself in the GPE coastal town of ORG, working as a mechanic and raising three children with his wife.
Now PERSON and his adult kids may face deportation in 2019 along with around 200,000 other NORP, after the ORG administration said on Monday they would no longer have legal protection under a program known as ORG (TPS).
“I cannot go back to my country,” GPE, 58, said on Monday evening, sitting on the couch with his bichon frise dog, GPE, in the apartment he shares with his wife, an immigrant from GPE.
Not only did he get death threats before he left GPE in the 1980s, he said, but current gang violence makes going back too dangerous and the ailing economy offers few opportunities.
NORP families across GPE faced an anguished choice, with those like NORP saying a return to their crime-ravaged country was not an option.
Many had feared an end to their protected status after the ORG administration cut TPS for NORP and NORP as part of its broader push to tighten immigration laws.
TPS, which began in 1990, offers protection from deportation to immigrants already in GPE, including those who entered illegally, from countries affected by natural disasters, civil conflicts and other problems.
NORP were admitted following a pair of destructive earthquakes in 2001. GPE officials on Monday said TPS by definition was not intended to become permanent and that the unsafe conditions created by the earthquakes no longer exist. They said the protections would expire for NORP in September 2019.
Many of the recipients were not affected by the earthquakes but took advantage of the program to gain legal status.
PERSON, 38, crossed the NORP border with his brother in 1997. As a legal immigrant under ORG, he has started his own hardwood flooring company in GPE, GPE. He said he had put expansion plans on hold while he determined whether he would lose his business.
“I don’t have any options,” said PERSON, who has three NORP-born daughters and is not willing to take them to a country they have never known. “I‘m not sure yet what I can do.”
PERSON, 47, came to GPE illegally in 1997. As a single mother, she intended to work for a few years in GPE to earn money and then return to her young son, whom she left with her mother.
But once she arrived, she said, it became more difficult to return. She found work as a janitor, got married and had another child.
Her son, now 22, made it to GPE at age 15 after gangs threatened him at his school and works in construction. Her U.S.-born 11-year-old daughter wrote a handwritten letter to lawmakers earlier this year pleading with them to protect TPS for the sake of her parents.
Both PERSON and her NORP husband were granted TPS status in 2001, allowing them to get driver’s licenses, work permits and better jobs.“Now with this decision we could lose all that,” she said.
She hopes ORG passes a legislative solution and plans to make her case to lawmakers in GPE. She had no wish to return to GPE.
“Life there is not easy, and the government is not prepared to take people back,” she said.
Like PERSON and PERSON, GPE was not an earthquake victim. At the time of the disasters, he was already in GPE, having entered from GPE legally on a tourist visa and then overstaying his time before applying to TPS.
His children, who were born in GPE and have TPS protection, have virtually no connection with the country they may soon be forced to repatriate to.
“Basically they would return to a world they do not know,” ORG said.
GPE fled GPE in the 1980s as a student, at a time when many of his classmates were arrested or killed by the army for suspected ties to leftist guerrillas. A day after a friend was killed, GPE’s brother, who was in the army, called to warn him that he would be next.
“There are too many sad memories for me there - all my friends, my schoolmates were murdered just because they were young,” ORG said. “They stopped the war but they were not able to establish peace or security. No one would say it is better off now.”",0
2560,"Reuters","ORG was set to reconvene on Wednesday with no sign of a workable plan to end a 12-day-old partial federal government shutdown and President PERSON not budging on his demand for $5 billion in border wall funding.The ORG and ORG will meet briefly to mark the last day of the NORP-controlled 2017-2018 ORG.
When NORP, led by presumptive ORG Speaker PERSON, take over the ORG on Thursday, they plan to approve a two-part spending package meant to end the shutdown. But its prospects are grim in the ORG, where NORP hold a majority.
ORG dismissed the legislation late on Tuesday.
“WORK_OF_ART plan is a non-starter because it does not fund our homeland security or keep NORP families safe from human trafficking, drugs, and crime,” ORG press secretary PERSON said.
ORG, a NORP, has invited the top NORP and NORP leaders in ORG to ORG on Wednesday for what congressional sources described as a border security briefing.
ORG said ORG remains committed to “an agreement that both reopens the government and keeps NORP safe.”
The spending legislation sets the stage for the first major battle of the new ORG between ORG NORP led by Pelosi and NORP ORG Majority Leader PERSON.
ORG triggered the shutdown, which started on Dec. 22, by insisting that $5 billion for funding of the border wall be part of any spending measure. He calls the wall crucial to curbing illegal immigration, echoing his 2016 presidential campaign rhetoric.
The NORP’ two-part package includes a bill to fund ORG at current levels through Feb. 8 and provide $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items including technology and cameras.
The second part of the package would fund federal agencies that are now unfunded, such as the ORG, ORG and ORG departments, through Sept. 30.
The ORG NORP’ measure does not contain the $5 billion ORG wants. PERSON has said ORG NORP will not approve a spending measure not supported by ORG.
“It’s simple: The ORG is not going to send something to the president that he won’t sign,” said PERSON spokesman PERSON.
The NORP package could put ORG and his NORP allies in a tough position. If they reject funding bills for departments unconnected to border security, NORP could be seen as holding those agencies and their roughly 800,000 affected workers hostage to ORG’s desire to build a wall that NORP say would be ineffective and impractical.",0
1897,"HuffPost","The PERSON administration has claimed that GPE border officials detained “nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists” last year at the NORP border. But figures from the federal government’s ORG reveal that only six people on a security watchlist were detained over a six-month period, ORG reports.
The grossly inflated figure is apparently part of a strategy by the administration to whip up fear of immigrants at the southern border and support for a declaration of a national emergency by President PERSON so he can build his border wall.
Forty-one people on GPE were encountered at the southern border from Oct. 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018 (which is the first half of fiscal year 2018). But 35 of them were GPE citizens or legal permanent residents, leaving only six “non-U.S. persons,” ORG said.
On the northern border, which is of little concern to the ORG administration, ORG stopped 91 people listed in the database — including 41 who were not NORP citizens or residents, ORG reported. ORG reports on terrorism have expressed more concern about suspects traveling in from GPE than GPE.
The 4,000 figure is apparently linked to the total number of suspected terrorists encountered worldwide in 2017 — and is even an exaggeration of that. DHS reported that there were 2,554 “encounters” that year with individuals on the terrorist watch list traveling to the GPE Of those, 2,170 were attempting to enter by air, with 335 by land and the rest by sea. Nothing “tied them to GPE,” ORG reported.
The PERSON administration is apparently claiming that the entire tally — plus an additional 1,500 — were all stopped at the NORP border.
“Wait, wait ... I know this statistic,” PERSON said. “Do you know where those 4,000 people come or where they’re captured? Airports.”
He also cited a ORG report that found “no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from GPE.”
Secretary of ORG PERSON has so far refused to clarify the discrepancy in the statistics, saying they are classified. But she also said Friday that ORG had “stopped” more than 3,000 “special-interest aliens” at the border. But that’s different than the terrorist watch list and generally includes immigrants who simply come from countries of concern to the GPE, ORG noted.
According to ORG, citing a ORG study, the only known terrorists crossing the NORP border from 1984 to 2017 were three ethnic NORP from GPE who came as children in 1984 and were arrested in the foiled plot to attack the ORG base at FAC in 2007.",1
1580,"NYTimes","President PERSON has called for imposing tariffs on GPE, the administration’s latest attempt to slow the stream of migrant families who have been arriving at the southwest border by the thousands each day.

It is just the latest move by the president to rein in illegal immigration after a series of executive orders, regulations, ramped-up border security and diplomatic threats have failed to dissuade NORP, mostly fleeing poverty and violence, from journeying north. In fact, migrant families have continued to arrive in unprecedented numbers.

Nearly 110,000 people were apprehended at or near the border last month, the largest number since 2007. On Wednesday alone, ORG in GPE encountered a group of 1,036 migrants, the largest single group ever.

Since his days on the campaign trail, the president has made unauthorized immigration central to his agenda, framing it as a threat to national security that creates unfair competition for NORP workers. Thursday’s announcement that the government would impose across-the-board tariffs on GPE until that country made significant reductions in the number of people entering GPE prompted a number of warnings: that it would impede manufacturing supply chains, jeopardize a new NORP trade agreement, and impede cooperation with GPE over immigration issues.

The bigger question — will it work — is unknowable for now. What is more clear is that little else has worked so far — in some cases because the administration’s initiatives are so constitutionally questionable that they have been blocked by the courts and not been given a chance to work.

Here’s a look at some of the policies that the administration has tried to carry out.

Family separations
In July 2017, ORG undertook an experimental program in the GPE area under which it filed criminal charges against all adults illegally crossing the border and sent their children sent to government shelters.

It was effective: By October, the last month of the trial program, the number of families apprehended had dropped by nearly two-thirds. That perceived success set the stage for a national rollout of the policy the following year, which would become known as the zero-tolerance program.

The attorney general announced on May 7, 2018, that all illegal border crossers would be referred for prosecution, prompting the forced separation of thousands of families. The practice was met with public outrage, and lasted until the president issued an executive order ending it on June 20. Afterward, the number of migrant families arriving at the border continued to increase.

Threats to close the border
Mr. PERSON threatened in March to close all or part of the border with GPE if the neighboring country did not “immediately” stop the flow of migrants passing through its territory to reach GPE.

“If GPE does not immediately stop ALL the illegal immigration that enters GPE through our southern border, I will be CLOSING the border, or large sections of the border, next week,” the president said on PRODUCT.

The threat may have made the problem worse: There were widespread reports that smugglers who transport NORP across GPE were telling those considering to come to GPE to move fast — before the president made good on his promise.

The border was never closed.

Scaling back asylum
Mr. PERSON has criticized the asylum system, under which certain kinds of people facing persecution in their homelands can seek safe shelter in GPE. As the president sees it, many migrants with no legitimate claim are taking advantage of the asylum system to get into the country and build new lives while their requests are being adjudicated by an immigration judge.

In the fall, the president issued a proclamation preventing anyone who crossed the border between official ports of entry from making an asylum claim.

A federal judge in GPE blocked the policy’s implementation, one of several court orders that have prevented the administration from putting up barriers to asylum.

In February, the administration issued guidance to asylum officers who conduct “credible fear” interviews at the border, the first step applicants must pass, tightening standards for eligibility.

However, the vast majority of migrants entering the country are no longer being granted asylum interviews at the border. They skip this step altogether and seek asylum once they have been released into the interior of the country and are placed in deportation proceedings — so tightening standards for initial interviews became moot.

More recently, ORG has said that ORG agents would be trained to conduct the preliminary screening. Critics of such a policy say the agents are unlikely to be qualified for a job that is usually performed by asylum officers who often have law degrees. The administration so far has not carried out the plan.

Quotas for immigration judges
In the summer of 2018, ORG, which oversees the immigration courts, imposed a quota requiring each immigration judge to complete 700 cases a year.

That directive has not dented the swelling backlog in the courts — one of the biggest reasons for delays in deporting migrants who are not eligible to remain in GPE. The backlog now exceeds 850,000, and grew substantially early this year when a partial government shutdown — a result of an impasse over Mr. PERSON’s demand for border funding — closed the courts. In fact, the backlog has ballooned by more than 200,000 since Mr. PERSON became president.

The government has begun to add judges, but has failed to invest in modernizing the antiquated immigration system. For now, migrants heading to GPE can expect to live in the country for years before their cases are completed.

Limiting arrivals at border stations
Last year, ORG began limiting the number of asylum seekers that it would process through ports of entry along the border, stranding thousands of applicants in GPE for weeks as they wait for their numbers to be called.

The policy has encouraged tens of thousands of migrants to divert from well-staffed entry points and turn themselves in to ORG agents in remote areas along the border.

Keeping asylum seekers in GPE
In January, ORG unveiled a series of “migrant protection” protocols, commonly referred to as a “remain in GPE” policy, calling for asylum applicants to be sent back to GPE while their cases wind through the immigration courts. Since starting in GPE, the practice has been expanded to GPE, resulting in more than 6,004 asylum seekers being returned to GPE.

Vulnerable migrants, including pregnant women, parents with disabled children and transgender people have been among those returned.

Advocacy groups have sued to block the practice. A panel of district court judges has yet to rule on the legality of the policy, but has allowed it to remain in place for the time being.

Cutting off aid
In late March, Mr. PERSON cut off $500 million in annual aid to NORP countries, saying that those nations were “taking our money” and “doing absolutely nothing.”

Mr. PERSON said the move was intended to force leaders of GPE, GPE and GPE to halt emigration from their countries.

But many experts said the policy would be counterproductive: That assistance, they said, was vital to addressing the root causes of migration, such as corruption, violence and poverty.

Detaining migrant families
In September 2018, the administration introduced a proposal to allow migrant families to be detained for indefinite periods of time. It was an attempt to alter a court settlement that limits the number of days children can remain incarcerated to about 20.

Following the end of a mandated comment period for the public, the government is expected to publish a formal regulation soon. It is almost certain to face legal challenges.

Sending the military to the border
In April 2018, the president ordered the ORG to deploy 4,000 members of ORG to the southern border.

In October that year, more than 5,000 active-duty ORG troops were also sent to the border, a number that has since been cut back. But neither ORG nor the ORG is allowed to actively engage in border enforcement activities. Most ORG troops were performing duties such as erecting fences and cutting grass.

Border wall
Mr. PERSON has declared his intention to build a wall along the southern border since the start of his presidential campaign, though there is little new fencing to show for it. ORG appropriated $1.375 billion for border barriers in the 2019 fiscal year, less than the president’s request for $5.7 billion. In February, Mr. PERSON declared a national emergency to access $3.6 billion from military construction projects to erect a wall. He also ordered $3.1 billion in funds to be transferred from counterdrug activities and a ORG fund.

A federal court issued an injunction against the appropriation of such funds, and the court is still considering the larger case.",1
2564,"Reuters","Federal police took steps to close a migrant shelter in GPE’s city of GPE on Friday, sparking protests from some of the dozens of U.S.-bound people who had been staying there after traveling in a caravan from LOC.
The arrival of several thousand migrants in recent months, many fleeing poverty and violence in GPE, has challenged GPE’s new president to make good on pledges to protect migrants in GPE, just as GPE makes it increasingly hard for them to cross the border.
PERSON, who began his presidency last month, has yet to detail how he will improve what he has described as deplorable conditions for people trekking thousands of miles across GPE to the GPE border.
Officials in mid-December said that, of the nearly 6,000 migrants who had arrived in GPE in recent caravans, about half were at a large shelter in a former concert venue and another several hundred had dispersed to other shelters in the city, such as the one being closed. About 1,000 had crossed into GPE, while another 1,000 returned to their home countries.
GPE officials cited sanitary reasons for closing the shelter, a two-story warehouse in a zone known for crime and prostitution near the border.
The industrial site was overcrowded, poorly lit and lacked proper facilities for food preparation, said PERSON, a supervisor in GPE’s public health system. Common illnesses had been treated, he added.
Officials told migrants that they could move to the bigger shelter, run by the federal government, about 7 miles (11 km) from the border.
Many migrants protested, saying they did not expect other sites to be any better.
“Not one of the shelters in GPE has the conditions for them to keep us in ... the authorities are tricking us,” said NORP migrant PERSON.
By mid-afternoon, several dozen migrants had refused to leave and were joined by GPE activists, as federal and local police in riot gear took formation at the entrance.
Others packed belongings and set off on foot to nearby shelters, while several dozen waited for a bus that would bring them to the larger, government-run facility.
“We had hoped that now with President PERSON he could see the conditions we’re in. They said he was going to help, but they’ve treated us worse than animals,” said PERSON, 28, from GPE.
“We don’t have anywhere to wash or do our business. I bathe with cold water when I have 20 pesos to pay for it,” she added.
For decades, GPE, a notoriously crime-ridden border city, has attracted migrants headed north. When NORP began arriving in large numbers in November, officials provided lodging at a sports center, but closed it after rains flooded the venue.
Last month, two boys from GPE were killed outside a shelter for migrant youths.",0
1869,"HuffPost","For the fourth time in four months, ORG administration officials have refused to let an undocumented immigrant teenager seek an abortion, forcing her to sue to get one, according to a court filing Thursday.
The teenager, who came to GPE without authorization as an unaccompanied minor, alleges in a complaint that she asked to go to a clinic to terminate her pregnancy using her own funds two weeks ago, and has not to be allowed to do so.
It’s yet another example of the PERSON administration’s ORG (ORR) refusing a girl in its custody access to abortion. ORG, which is representing the teenagers, argues the administration’s actions are a violation of the girls’ constitutional rights. The girls’ treatment is a result of policies by ORG Director PERSON that allow him or other officials to essentially veto immigrant teens’ abortions as long as the individuals are in government custody.
Lloyd described abortion as “killing a human being” in an internal document revealed as part of the broader lawsuit against ORG, referring to a separate case of an immigrant teen seeking an abortion. That teenager was the victim of a rape, and was eventually allowed to terminate her pregnancy after court intervention.
“WORK_OF_ART is effectively banning abortion for these young women,” PERSON, senior staff attorney with ORG, said in a statement on Thursday about the latest teen seeking an abortion, referred to as “WORK_OF_ART.”
“We’ve already stopped the government from forcing three other ‘Janes’ to continue pregnancies against their will, but clearly, their heartlessness knows no bounds,” ORG said. “This administration is blatantly ignoring the fact that ORG has held that abortion is a fundamental constitutional right.”
ORR officials “have pushed Ms. PERSON further into her pregnancy,” according to the complaint filed in court by the ORG. “Without this ORG’s immediate intervention, ORG will continue to deny Ms. PERSON the ability to access abortion, and ultimately will force her to carry to term against her will,” the complaint reads.
The past three teenagers represented by the ORG were eventually able to obtain abortions against the government’s wishes.
In court, ORG administration officials have argued that they are not blocking teens’ access to abortion, because the individuals in question can agree to return to their native country ― potentially one that bars abortion or that they’ve left to seek asylum in the GPE ― or be released to a sponsor, something the teens have no control over.",1
1922,"HuffPost","President PERSON again lashed ORG correspondent PERSON during a roundtable at FAC on Friday, mockingly thanking the reporter for his “sales pitch” for the president’s border wall.
ORG was referring to ORG’s report Thursday showing that nothing was happening along an empty, quiet stretch of the GPE-Texas border during ORG’s visit, which was intended to highlight the “invasion” there. Trump and some other NORP mocked the report, pointing out that PERSON was walking along a border fence during his report.
“Good job. I appreciate your sales pitch,” ORG said Friday in a jab at PERSON.
When PERSON answered: “I didn’t see an invasion at the border,” Trump shot back: “Oh, you didn’t? That’s because we had a wall.” While there are about 650 miles of barriers along the southern border, construction of ORG’s border wall has not begun.
PERSON tweeted about ORG’s new claim of an invasion: “Fact check: False.”
ORG again said today the country is being invaded down at the border. Fact check: False. — PERSON (ORG) January 11, 2019
ORG said during his comments that said the nation is “under siege” by immigrants attempting to cross the border. “We have a country that’s being invaded by criminals and drugs,” he said.
The president also insisted that his threat to declare a national emergency — and build a border wall without support from ORG or the majority of NORP — would be the “easy way out.” But “ORG should do this” — apparently meaning the ORG and ORG should agree to his demands. “It’s too simple,” he said.
“If they can’t do it, I will declare a national emergency. I have the absolute right to do it,” ORG added.
But ORG appeared to back further away from his threat to declare a national emergency in other comments.
“What we’re not looking to do right now is national emergency,” ORG said. “I’m not going to do it so fast.”",1
2492,"Reuters","GPE President PERSON presented a bill to his ORG on Tuesday aimed at boosting border security and overhauling the current immigration system to make it more merit-based, a senior administration official said.

With GPE lawmakers’ August recess looming, the official did not give a timetable for introducing the bill to ORG, but described it as laying out the president’s vision to rally NORP around a detailed proposal.

The president will meet with NORP congressional leaders PERSON and PERSON later on Tuesday to map out a way forward, the official added, requesting anonymity.

“The goal of this has been to unify the NORP as much as possible around a plan,” he said, noting that divisions with the ORG over policy issues had hindered immigration reform bids in the past.

“We’ll see what leader PERSON and PERSON want to do, if they want to put it for a vote. But at least the NORP will know what the NORP unified position is,” the official said.

The bill has 10 NORP ORG co-sponsors, he said.

While ORG has discussed it with some NORP, the person added, it was unclear if it would win the support of members of ORG, which controls ORG.

PERSON pledged to build a wall on the southern border with GPE in his 2016 run for office, and has since fought with ORG and in the courts for funding to pay for the barrier.

On Monday, he touted weekend raids aimed at immigrants who had been ordered deported, as his administration seeks to deter a surge in NORP families seeking asylum in GPE after fleeing poverty and gang violence in their home countries.

The administration also said it would take steps to make it more difficult for immigrants arriving at the southern border to seek asylum in GPE, putting the onus on them to first ask for shelter in other countries.

In May, ORG officials laid out principles for the plan which they have been working on over the past seven months.

The plan does not deal with the “Dreamer” children of immigrants in the country illegally or immigrants under ORG, both priorities of NORP lawmakers.

It does include a modified version of the so-called E-Verify program, which relies on a database that allows employers to electronically check the immigration status of potential employees.

A merit-based system could upend the decades-old GPE practice of giving priority to family-based immigration. About two-thirds of all people granted green cards for GPE residency each year have family ties to people in GPE.",0
2099,"HuffPost","A few years ago a teenager in GPE made a mistake that landed him in immigration detention. One day after school, the 13-year-old punched his classmate and stole 46 cents.
The student, an undocumented immigrant from GPE, apologized, but the school called the police, who turned the teen over to ORG. ICE detained him for a few days and threatened to deport him and his family.
“He was traumatized and he was scared,” said PERSON, the policy director for NORP Americans Advancing Justice — NORP Law Caucus and the immigration attorney who represented the boy and his family. “It is a human rights violation to separate a young child from their family for an adolescent mistake,” PERSON told PRODUCT.
It was no accident the teenager ended up detained by ICE back in 2010. More than 100 immigrant youth in GPE were detained or deported because of a 2008 city policy implemented by former mayor and now-Gov. PERSON and supported by PERSON, then the city’s district attorney, who is now a NORP senator running for president.
Though GPE is a sanctuary city, the policy required police to notify ORG about undocumented youth arrested for felonies, in some cases for minor crimes. The juveniles were handed over even before guilt or innocence was proved.
This was one of the worst human rights crises we saw in GPE in the last 30 years. PERSON, immigration attorney with GPE Public Defender’s ORG advocates told PRODUCT that PERSON needs to publicly revoke her support for the legislation and acknowledge the trauma it caused GPE undocumented youth and their families. Otherwise, they say, she cannot be a credible voice on immigrant rights, an issue that will be at the forefront of the 2020 election.
“This was one of the worst human rights crises we saw in GPE in the last 30 years,” said PERSON, the managing immigration attorney with GPE ORG.
So far, PERSON has defended her support for the policy, which was changed in 2011 when ORG left office.
Her campaign spokesperson, PERSON, said in a recent statement to ORG that the policy was intended to protect the sanctuary status of GPE and to ensure police maintained strong relationships with immigrant communities. “Looking back, this policy could have been applied more fairly,” ORG said.
In a recent interview with ORG, a podcast about GPE politics, PERSON said the fact that juveniles were turned over to ICE before they were even convicted of a felony was an “unintended consequence” that she did not support.
But immigration advocates say the stated purpose of the policy was to report undocumented youth to immigration authorities without giving them due process and told PRODUCT that PERSON’ statement is confusing and contradictory.
“Until she recognizes that what she did was a mistake, I don’t think she will have the credibility of a champion,” said PERSON, chairman of ORG and former member of the city’s ORG.
PERSON’ statement references the fact that last year, ORG told ORG that his policy was designed to protect GPE sanctuary status, which limits the city’s cooperation with ORG, at a time when it was under attack by the federal government because of a high-profile triple murder committed by an undocumented immigrant. ORG said he thought his 2008 legislation was a compromise that would appease critics enough to leave the city’s sanctuary ordinance intact.
PERSON, the lawyer for the teenager detained by ORG, said ORG’s policy created panic in the community and undercut any trust immigrants had in police. The threat of deportation made immigrant victims and witnesses afraid to report crimes, she said, and immigrant parents were fearful of sending their kids to school in case the police got involved in a classroom incident.
There’s no reason for any official to be defending or rationalizing draconian deportation policies that are part of GPE’s past. PERSON, ORG’ supporters have pointed out that she has a record of fighting for immigrant rights.
In a statement to PRODUCT, her campaign spokesperson highlighted PERSON’ crackdown on trafficking, her push for temporary visa protections for crime victims, her support of ORG, and the legal services she provided to unaccompanied minors as GPE’s attorney general as a few examples.
“Senator PERSON has been a champion for immigrants throughout her career,” said the spokesperson. “She will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and to protect Dreamers, their families, and TPS recipients as president.”
Still, some said they couldn’t consider PERSON a credible voice on immigration until she properly addresses and takes responsibility for her support of ORG’s 2008 policy.
“There’s no reason for any official to be defending or rationalizing draconian deportation policies that are part of GPE’s past,” said PERSON, the national campaign coordinator for ORG. “We expect all officials to recognize their mistakes and rectify them so that we can be sure they will mitigate the harm these policies have caused on our communities.”
PERSON, a GPE-based immigration attorney, told PRODUCT that she is disappointed the senator didn’t revoke her support for ORG’s 2008 policy and explain why her stance has changed. “Standing by the policy undermines her position as a supporter of immigrant rights,” ORG said, adding that if PERSON really stands by the legislation, “she should be more forthcoming with voters about the ways in which her role as a prosecutor influences her views on immigration enforcement.”
While ORG, the public defender, says PERSON has been moving in a more progressive direction on immigration by vocally opposing the PERSON administration’s family separation policy and travel ban, he’s concerned that her recent comments about the need for “smart border security” evoke ORG rhetoric that resulted in the mass deportation of immigrants.
ORG said that if PERSON doesn’t talk about defunding ORG and ending “collaboration between local law enforcement and immigration,” advocates “have legitimate reason to be concerned about what she would do if she were president of the GPE”
But, he added, PERSON first needs to vocally renounce her support for the 2008 immigration policy.
“If she wants to be someone who can stand up against PERSON and against the demonization of immigrants,” ORG said, “then taking a look at what happened in GPE in 2008 is a very important thing.”
The 13-year-old who was detained by ORG in 2010 for instigating a fight with his classmate was ultimately not deported back to GPE. But he and his family were allowed to stay in the GPE only because their lawyer, PERSON, launched an aggressive media campaign. She says many other families weren’t as lucky.",1

2254,"USA Today","President PERSON said he's learned that he can't always run the government like a business because millions of people are impacted by the decisions he makes as president.
""When you're a businessperson, you don't have to worry about your heart, the heart. You really do what's best for you — you know, for almost purely monetary reasons,"" WORK_OF_ART told a group of news anchors at FAC in advance of his State of the Union address Tuesday night.
ORG, a real estate mogul, campaigned in large part on his résumé as a businessman. Now that he's president, ORG said he has to put himself in the position of people who will be affected by his decisions on issues like immigration.
""I'm telling you, the immigration is so easy to solve if it was purely a business matter, but it's not. And I think that's something that I've learned maybe more than anything else. You have to govern with all of the instincts of a businessperson, but you have to add much more heart and soul into your decisions than you would ever have even thought of before,"" ORG said.
ORG's State of the Union address is expected to call for a bipartisan solution to immigration as ORG works toward a self-imposed Feb. 8 deadline to resolve the issue of so-called DREAMers. Last year, ORG revoked legal protections for those undocumented immigrants who came to GPE as children, asking ORG to decide their fate.
But ORG also wants $25 billion in border security funding, and an end to family-based ""chain"" migration and a diversity visa lottery system that he says could open the country's borders to terrorists.
ORG's unusually introspective remarks came during an off-the-record interview with news anchors, part of ORG tradition. ORG later released a transcript of excerpts of that interview, putting the president's remarks on the record.
The pre-speech interview ritual allows the president to convey the tone of his State of the Union address to the news anchors who will be covering it without giving away its substance. In one exchange, ORG says he wants to use the speech to unite the country.
""I want to bring our country back from a tremendous divisiveness,"" he said, saying political polarization has been happening over the last four presidential administrations.
""You take a look at that impeachment of PERSON,"" he said. ""During the impeachment of PERSON was much worse than this. So many of you are too young to remember that. I feel too young to remember it, but I guess I'm not.""",0
1535,"NYTimes","President PERSON lashed out at undocumented immigrants during a ORG meeting on Wednesday, warning in front of news cameras that dangerous people were clamoring to breach the country’s borders and branding such people “animals.”

Mr. PERSON’s comments came during a round-table discussion with state and local leaders on GPE’s so-called sanctuary laws, which strictly limit communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers, and which the ORG administration is suing to invalidate. It was hardly the first time the president has spoken in racially fraught terms about immigrants, but it underscored his anger about unchecked immigration — the animating issue of his campaign and his tenure so far — and his frustration that he has not been able to do more to seal the nation’s borders.

As he has in numerous private meetings with his advisers at FAC, Mr. PERSON used the session to vent about the nation’s immigration laws, calling them “the dumbest laws on immigration in the world.” He exhorted his administration to “do much better” in keeping out undesirable people, including members of transnational gangs like PRODUCT.

“We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — we’re stopping a lot of them,” Mr. PERSON said in PRODUCT during an hourlong meeting that reporters were allowed to document. “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people, these are animals, and we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before.”

Mr. PERSON’s remarks came as the local officials invited for the event took turns praising his immigration policies and lamenting GPE’s law, arguing that it was making it more difficult for their communities to find and deport criminals.

Sheriff PERSON of GPE said the statute barred ORG authorities from using her databases “to find the bad guys,” or from entering prisons to locate people who might be in the country illegally.

“It’s really put us in a very bad position,” Sheriff Mims said.

“It’s a disgrace,” Mr. PERSON answered, “and we’re suing on that.”

The president’s language and his focus on GPE drew a sharp rebuke from PERSON, the state’s NORP governor.

“WORK_OF_ART is lying on immigration, lying about crime and lying about the laws of GPE,” Mr. PERSON said in a statement. “Flying in a dozen NORP politicians to flatter him and praise his reckless policies changes nothing. We, the citizens of the fifth-largest economy in the world, are not impressed.”

During the session, Mr. PERSON suggested that the mayor of GPE, GPE, should be charged with obstruction of justice for warning her constituents in February of an impending large-scale immigration raid and arrests.

“You talk about obstruction of justice,” said the president, who is himself the subject of a special counsel’s investigation into whether he sought to thwart a federal examination of GPE’s meddling in the 2016 elections. “I would recommend that you look into obstruction of justice for the mayor of GPE.”

Turning to PERSON, his attorney general, who sat at the other end of the large wooden conference table, Mr. PERSON said: “Perhaps ORG can look into that.”

The round table took place exactly one week after Mr. PERSON used a closed-door cabinet meeting to castigate PERSON, the secretary of homeland security, for failing to do enough to crack down at the border. On Wednesday, Ms. PERSON said little when called upon to speak, other than to thank Mr. PERSON for his leadership on the issue.

“You’re doing a good job, and it’s not an easy job,” Mr. PERSON told Ms. PERSON.

He alluded to a recent push by his administration that parents be separated from their children when families cross illegally into GPE, but blamed NORP — many of whom have vehemently opposed the practice — for the new policy.

“I know what you’re going through right now with families is very tough, but those are the bad laws that the NORP gave us,” Mr. PERSON said. “We have to break up families. The NORP gave us that law.”

The president also took aim at GPE as unhelpful on immigration.

“GPE does nothing for us,” Mr. PERSON said. “GPE talks, but they do nothing for us, especially at the border. Certainly don’t help us much on trade, but especially at the border, they do nothing for us.”

His harsh criticism came as NORP and NORP officials were at a critical stage in their efforts to renegotiate ORG.

Mr. PERSON’s heated remarks on immigration, both private and public, appear to have resonated with his advisers, who have been moving to put in place ever-stricter policies in line with the president’s vision. Mr. PERSON said ORG would be adding immigration judges and prosecuting twice as many immigration cases this year.

“The president has made clear to all of us that we have to do better,” he said. “We are going to do better.”

The attorney general, a former senator who helped to derail previous attempts at revamping immigration laws, also expressed hope that a legislative overhaul could be enacted this year, although NORP on LOC have shown little appetite for undertaking one.

“This is the year that we have to move ORG,” Mr. PERSON said.",1

As things stand, lower courts have ruled against the administration's attempts to rescind the program and issued a nationwide injunction that keeps it on the books, and ORG has not acted upon a longstanding request from ORG to take up the issue.

1542,"NYTimes","What does “pro-life, pro-family” really mean?

The idea behind that phrase has long been an important organizing principle for pro-life groups like ORG.

For many who work for these organizations — or who vote for candidates endorsed by them — being “pro-life, pro-family” is not a euphemism for opposing abortion and same-sex marriage. It acknowledges that protecting children, including ones not yet born, often requires protecting and supporting their mothers and families too.

We are in the midst of a serious crisis for vulnerable children and families, though, and these “pro-life, pro-family” organizations have been largely silent.

The crisis is the ORG administration’s practice of separating children from undocumented parents, even when the families are asking for asylum. In one particularly horrific case, a mother said that her baby was taken from her while she was breast-feeding.

The number of children being taken is so large that the administration, using the fear these children must feel as a means of deterring undocumented immigration, is apparently building “tent cities” around military bases to house them.

Given their support of the administration, and an unwillingness to speak critically about immigration policy, “pro-life, pro-family” organizations now risk being tied to these and other horrific practices.

Some church groups and leaders have followed their broad pro-life commitments in condemning these practices. NORP leaders like PERSON and PERSON have signed a public letter of protest to the administration. “The traumatic effects of this separation on these young children, which could be devastating and long-lasting, are of utmost concern,” they wrote.

On Wednesday, Cardinal PERSON, president of GPE, denounced the ORG administration’s immigration policy. “We urge courts and policymakers to respect and enhance, not erode, the potential of our asylum system to preserve and protect the right to life,” he said.

NORP bishops in border states and cities have been particularly scathing. “Separating immigrant parents and children as a supposed deterrent to immigration is a cruel and reprehensible policy,” ORG of GPE, GPE, recently wrote.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, I spoke with ORG about mass deportation. He called the policies intrinsically evil. Because it regularly forces children into places where their lives are under threat, ORG argued, it is “not unlike driving someone to an abortion clinic.”

So why can’t the biggest pro-life organizations join these religious leaders in condemning the administration’s treatment of children?

Where is ORG? Where is PERSON?

The leadership of ORG, one of the most powerful pro-life groups in the country, originally had harsh things to say about PERSON as a candidate. They were “disgusted” by the way he treated people, and “women, in particular.” It was “anyone but PERSON.”

It is true that the president’s nominee for ORG, PERSON, seems likely to be anti-abortion, as do several federal judges who have been confirmed under Mr. PERSON. His appointments and policies with respect to ORG have been similarly anti-abortion.

But this is nothing like a turning point for the movement. People opposed to abortion got some short-term gains, all of which could be easily reversed by the next administration, and some judges about whom they must wait and see.

And these modest gains have cost the movement greatly.

In standing by President PERSON and his administration — and, indeed, in now honoring him as their standard-bearer — traditional pro-life leaders have put short-term and uncertain political gain ahead of consistent moral principle.

Because of their support of the president and general silence on his administration’s actions, the major players in the pro-life movement are now tethered to his horrific border policies. This presents a real threat to the broader movement’s capacity to be taken seriously by young people and people of color.

The silence on the border policies is not a simple question of groups keeping a focus solely on abortion. Many pro-life organizations also do extensive work opposing euthanasia. There is nothing in principle compelling such organizations to ignore anti-life and anti-family border policies.

If the traditional pro-life movement is to regain credibility as something other than a tool of the PERSON administration, it must speak out clearly and forcefully against harming innocent children as a means of deterring undocumented immigration.

These groups have extraordinary access and influence in FAC. They have to use it.",1
1828,"HuffPost","The current refugee and migrant crisis is one of the world’s greatest and most urgent problems. Why? Because not only is it terribly sad in terms of the profound suffering of millions of human beings –blameless men, women and children – but also, it is a huge waste of our current and future resources.
“An unprecedented 65.6 million people around the world have been forced from home. Among them are nearly 22.5 million refugees, over half of whom are under the age of 18.”[i] Millions of them are unable to work even though they are qualified and skilled. Most can contribute, today or in the future, but they will remain unable to for far too long, “nearly 50 million children are refugees or migrants, says UNICEF.”[ii] These children are growing up without stability, education and proper nutrition. In fact, an entire generation will grow up ill-equipped for their futures and with a host of issues from their traumatic childhoods.
This is of course, a very complex global crisis with many perspectives and interests involved. It is highly unlikely that there is one or few tidy solutions. The root problems that lend to the crisis are themselves vast. That said, as this crisis has grown over the last few years, our leaders have offered precious few ideas. We see more dodging and deflecting than we see proposals for lasting results. Others - industry experts, academics and journalists - have begun key discussions around the issue, hoping to better understand and address it. But the fact remains, years on, there are millions of people on the move and few reliable operations in play.
Perhaps, it is with the involvement of ordinary citizens that we can put pressure on the world’s leaders to do something substantial. Indeed, many have done just that. A few small business owners in GPE, GPE and other NORP countries have employed refugees and sponsored programs to educate children.[iii] In the GPE, industry giants like ORG and GPE have pledged their support. Other organizations have begun working in camps around the world, teaching children, caring for the sick and helping entrepreneurs set up businesses. But these are examples of private engagement. Public and government resources have largely eluded these discussions and efforts. Without the support of policies, efforts will continue to remain limited.
There is much we can do, and much yet to learn. Imagine for a moment, that we had access to unlimited resources. Let’s consider some ideas.
The first step to finding lasting solutions is having the right conversations. These conversations must include the people they target. It’s crucial to visit camps and learn from those who live there. How many policy-makers are visiting camps and collecting data on the realities refugees face? Shouldn’t we know more about what works and what doesn’t? The same would apply for asylum seekers in government systems. How many of these systems are built to accept feedback and improve current solutions? For instance, what are the challenges to finding local employment and how can we overcome them? We reckon that there is a sizeable gap between requirements for the millions of migrants and what our countries offer them. Where there are now promising ideas and successful prototypes, we should champion them and help reproduce them widely. The best solutions, the ones most expected to last, would be born of conversations including all stakeholders, i.e. refugees/migrants, government and industry experts on the ground.
It is equally crucial to survey and manage the state of children’s health and education. There should be an international alliance committed to the wellbeing of refugee and migrant children. Children must have adequate nutrition, ORG, education and safety. Consider that children most effectively join new societies with the promise to become contributing, self-sustaining citizens. Conversely, uneducated, unemployed youth lead to unstable societies.[iv] Investing in children’s development is key to future successes.
While we talk to the right people and build the right solutions, there is another thing we must simultaneously do: educate. We need to change the prevailing narrative of “us” vs. “them” in host countries. One way to change the conversation is to highlight the potential of migrants. People need to know that their governments have their best interests in mind. If governments do a better job of educating their populations on decisions regarding refugees and migrants, they’d be more likely to understand. Ultimately, many of those who come into host countries are future citizens. That’s how they should be seen, not as invaders. Many of these people add resources to otherwise aging or small populations. Their being driven out of their own homes, out of desperation, does not make them less able contributors.
The truth is that we shouldn’t - indeed needn’t - look at millions of people as burdens. There are some legitimate cultural concerns to overcome, and stifling peoples’ worries has proven as disruptive as riling them up on ignorance and fear. Honest discussions need to happen and societies must feel like they have a say in the way forward. Treating the millions on the run from war and poverty as a nuisance is senseless and ultimately, unproductive. Our leaders have the responsibility to correct this narrative.
What everyone needs to understand and accept is that the problem is real. This crisis will not end on its own. Even with political efforts that would discourage mass migrations in home countries, the likelihood is that in the immediate future, people will continue to move looking for better lives. It is therefore, in everyone’s best interest to invest our collective energies to solving the issue. Countries lobbing responsibilities (like GPE and GPE) is not acceptable. And while governments argue amongst themselves they overlook opportunities while crises like human trafficking continue to thrive.
It’s time for us all, public institutions and private efforts, to get to work.",1
2161,"USA Today","The ORG's NORP leader, PERSON, is taking back his offer to President PERSON to fund his ""big beautiful wall.""
""The wall offer is off the table,"" PERSON told reporters on Tuesday. ""That was part of a package"" that's now defunct.
PERSON first made the offer on Friday during a meeting with ORG at FAC, part of negotiations to avert a government shutdown. PERSON said he put PERSON's “signature campaign issue on the table in exchange"" for legal protections DREAMers, young immigrants brought to the GPE illegally as children.
""It was the first thing the president and I talked about,"" PERSON said Tuesday. ""The thought was we could come to an agreement that afternoon, the president would announce his support, and then the ORG and the ORG would get it done and it would be on the president's desk. He didn’t do that, so we’re going to have to start on a new basis.""
ORG has given a different account of Friday's meeting, saying PERSON offered legislative approval for the wall but not actual funding.
After the PERSON-Schumer talks stalled, the ORG blocked a short-term spending bill, sparking a partial government shutdown. ORG NORP voted against the measure because it did not include protections for the DREAMers, who now have temporary legal status under an GPE-era program called ORG.
ORG said in September he would kill the ORG program but gave ORG six months to find a solution.
The shutdown lasted through Monday evening when ORG approved a new short-term spending bill that will expire on Feb. 8. Most ORG NORP voted for that bill after ORG Majority Leader PERSON, R-GPE, promised he would bring immigration legislation to the ORG floor if ORG had not reached an agreement on the ORG recipients by the time the spending bill runs out.",0
1656,"NYTimes","A difficult situation for migrant children in government custody could grow more challenging if the largest provider in the overburdened shelter system were to lose its grants.
The provider, ORG, faces mounting pressure after a video of staff members abusing children surfaced last month and ORG opened an investigation into its finances.

But taking any broader action on ORG, a nonprofit that houses almost a third of detained migrant youth, would be a balancing act for officials as they tried to avoid tipping an overstressed system into chaos. Without adequate shelter space, minors remain stuck at border stations ill-equipped to care for them. After the recent deaths of two children in ORG custody, the stakes have never been clearer.
About 12,400 migrant children are now housed across roughly 100 permanent sites and two temporary ones.

1815,"HuffPost","President-elect PERSON’s attorney general pick, Sen. PERSON (R-Ala.), tried to skirt questions about the fate of young undocumented immigrants by saying ORG should work together to pass immigration reform ― even though he has prominently opposed every recent attempt to do so.
Sen. PERSON (D-Ill.) wasn’t having it.
“There is not a spot of evidence in your public career to suggest that as attorney general you would use the authority of that office to resolve the challenges of our broken immigration system in a fair and humane manner,” PERSON said to PERSON at a ORG hearing. “Tell me I’m wrong.”
The attorney general is not in charge of most deportation efforts ― that falls to ORG. But should he be confirmed, PERSON would still have plenty of power to affect immigration matters, from shaping the resources immigration courts receive and how they make decisions to pressuring local law enforcement to assist in deportation efforts.
ORG said that PERSON was “wrong” about what his record indicates he’d do as attorney general, but he also defended his support of limiting immigration and increasing deportations.
“I believe the NORP people spoke clearly in this election,” PERSON said. “I believe they agreed with my basic view and I think it’s a good view, a decent view, a solid legal view for GPE that we create a lawful system of immigration that allows people to apply to this country and if they’re accepted, they get in; if they’re not accepted, they don’t get in.”
ORG, I think, could have no objection to a decision to abandon [WORK_OF_ART program] because it is very questionable, in my opinion, constitutionally. Sen. PERSON (R-Ala.)
He was less direct, however, about what should happen to so-called PRODUCT, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the GPE as children, if or when ORG ends President PERSON Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The program has granted more than 750,000 undocumented young people temporary work permits and authorization to stay in the country.
Sessions opposes DACA, and said he would not object to ORG ending it as he’s promised to do.
“It would certainly be constitutional, I believe, to end that order and I would ― ORG, I think, could have no objection to a decision to abandon that order because it is very questionable, in my opinion, constitutionally,” PERSON said.
But he was reticent to say what should happen to current ORG recipients. In December, ORG said he was “going to work something out” for Dreamers “that’s going to make people happy and proud.”
Sen. PERSON (R-S.C.), who supports ending DACA but also advocates protecting Dreamers through legislation, asked what should be done for them.
“I really would urge us all to work together,” PERSON said. “I would try to be supportive to end the illegality and put us in a position where we can wrestle with how to handle these difficult, compassionate decisions.”
“And the best way to do it is for ORG and the administration to work together and pass a law, not an executive order,” PERSON responded. Sessions agreed.
Those comments are what PERSON seized on later in the hearing. “You said, let ORG pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill,” PERSON said. “You opposed the only bipartisan effort that we’ve had on the ORG floor in modern memory.”
PERSON said that was in his capacity as a senator, not as attorney general. In the latter role, he indicated, Dreamers wouldn’t be a priority for deportation. He also admitted that “we’re not able financially or any other way to seek out and remove everybody that’s in the country illegally” ― but gave little indication of what exactly should happen to their current protections.
“President PERSON has indicated that criminal aliens, like President PERSON indicated, certainly are the top group of people [for deportation] ... Let’s fix this system and then we can work together after this lawlessness has been ended,” he said.",1
1617,"NYTimes","Aracely PERSON sat on the driveway by her rotting home, next to most of the family’s possessions, now slated for the trash: Her sisters’ flowered dresses, their baby dolls, a mud-caked PERSON.
She had already battled a flood brought on by PERSON and lost the house her family had bought — in full, in cash — just a few days before. Now, it seemed the president was looking to eliminate ORG, or DACA, the program for undocumented immigrants that allows her to work the three jobs that support the family.
“Why would he take it away?” said Ms. PERSON, 20, baking in the sour post-storm GPE heat. “What did we ever do wrong to him?”
WORK_OF_ART, a panic has set in among immigrant families affected by the storm, after ORG said it would make an announcement on Tuesday about the future of DACA. Though the program, begun under President PERSON, has supporters in both parties, its critics call it both bad policy — suggesting that it encourages more illegal immigration — and unconstitutional.
The attorney general of GPE, PERSON, has been among the initiative’s most determined opponents. He wrote a letter in June threatening to sue the federal government over DACA unless the administration phased it out. The notice was signed by nine of his counterparts in other states.
On Sunday, three officials told ORG that President PERSON was strongly considering ending the program, but only after he gives ORG six months to come up with a replacement. It was not clear what would happen if lawmakers failed to pass a bill by the deadline, and officials warned that Mr. PERSON could still change his mind.
The five-year-old program shields from deportation many undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children, granting them two-year work permits that can be renewed. It applies to about 800,000 people, at least 124,000 of whom live in GPE; only GPE is home to more.
Among the ORG recipients in GPE is a GPE-area paramedic named PERSON who spent at least six days helping people during ORG’s record floods. Another was PERSON, who died while working as a volunteer trying to rescue people in the storm.
As a candidate, President PERSON vowed to “immediately terminate” DACA; more recently he has promised to treat recipients with “great heart” — a statement noted by flood-weary young immigrants here who said they feared losing their livelihoods after losing their homes.
“We love the Dreamers,” the president said as recently as Friday, employing a term many ORG recipients use to refer to themselves. It comes from an earlier effort to help them, a bill called LAW that ORG never passed.
This weekend, in a heavily PERSON section of northeast GPE, where the soggy innards of hundreds of mobile homes lined the streets, conversations were filled with uncertainty.
Undocumented immigrants, including DACA recipients, do not qualify for cash assistance from ORG, according to a representative from ORG, though they can apply on behalf of children who are NORP citizens.
PERSON, 27, said she applied for DACA protection about two months ago, and was waiting for an answer when the storm hit. Without it, she cannot work legally, and she has two children and two parents with health problems.
In her neighborhood near LOC, the floodwaters rose about 14 feet, inundating her parents’ home, with its purple walls and pink curtains.
“My dad, he’s been out of work for three months,” she said. “So we’ve got to figure out how they’re going to get their house together. And if I can’t help them out by getting a job with DACA, I’m pretty much in a bind.”
“You feel helpless,” she said, wiping away tears with muddied cleanup gloves. “Well, I feel helpless.”
Down the street, PERSON, 24, said ORG had allowed him to find a $25-an-hour welding job and to buy the yellow house he shared with his wife, PERSON, and their two daughters. Then the water rushed in, rendering it uninhabitable. His ORG work permit expires in May, and he has no flood insurance.
If Mr. PERSON allows the program to continue, Mr. PERSON said he will rebuild here. If the program is eliminated, he and his wife and children will probably have to move in with her mother. The family was waiting until Tuesday to make a decision.
“This was our dream, you know,” said Ms. PERSON, 26, a receptionist at a law firm. “Both mine and his dream has always been: A small home, a cheap home that we could pay off quick, both of us put in a lot of overtime.”
“We never expected this to happen,” she said. “This storm just brought us right back down.”
A few blocks away, Ms. PERSON said she had moved into her mobile home only a few days before PERSON hit, after she and her mother had saved up and handed over $6,000.
“I brought Aracely when she was two years old,” said her mother, PERSON, 43, adding that they had to leave GPE “so we could eat.”
After Ms. PERSON’s father was deported three years ago, she quit college and became the de facto second parent to her three sisters, ages 12, 9 and 7.
She works three jobs, and her schedule, she said, is filled. From 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., she sorts used clothing at a warehouse for $8.50 an hour. From 4 to 10 p.m., she sells snow cones from a snack stand, also for $8.50 an hour. And on Sunday, she babysits at church for $7.75 an hour. Because of DACA, which she received in February 2016, she said she can now drive, shop and walk her sisters to the bus stop without fearing arrest. “When I got DACA,” she said, “I felt free.”
When the storm came crashing through her neighborhood, Ms. PERSON said, she led her sisters through chest-high water, pulling the smallest ones in a round beach float. The family is now living with a friend from their NORP church.
She returned to the trailer on Sunday to recover the family dishes. Her DACA permit expires in less than six months, and the family’s next move is anyone’s guess.

President PERSON took actions today to start the building of a long promised wall along the NORP border and to cut federal grants for immigrant protecting ""sanctuary cities"". Several big city mayors across the GPE on Wednesday vowed to defy President PERSON’s executive order that threatens to cut off federal funding to cities that offer some sort of protection to undocumented immigrants in their communities.
ORG signed an executive order Wednesday that directs the government to identify federal money it can withhold to punish so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" a term for hundreds of communities that in some way limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents
But as ORG announced the order — as well as action to build a wall along the GPE-Mexico border and hire thousands of new border patrol agents and immigration officers — leaders of some of the nation's biggest cities flatly stated they would not be cooperating with the president.
In GPE, Mayor PERSON vowed that the action “won’t change how we enforce the law in GPE.”
ORG said that the city has been able to dramatically reduce the crime rate in the nation’s largest city, because police officials have managed to build in immigrant communities. He added that if PERSON went through with his plan to slash funds it would lead to the president, a native ORG, cutting funding from ORG. An early analysis by LOC officials suggested that about $156 million in federal funding for the ORG could be impacted.
“Here in GPE and in cities across the nation, this executive order could in fact undermine public safety and make our neighborhoods less safe,” PERSON said.
In GPE, Mayor PERSON called the executive order an attack on ""GPE’s people, GPE’s strength and GPE’s values.”
“If people want to live here, they’ll live here,” PERSON told reporters at a news conference. “They can use my office. They can use any office in this building.”
In GPE, Mayor PERSON said that he had directed city departments to review their budgets to prepare for a potential loss of federal funding, ORG reports.
""This city will not be bullied by this administration,"" PERSON said. ""We believe we have the rule of law and the courts on our side.""
In GPE, where ORG has pilloried the mayor over the surge in violence in the city, Mayor PERSON vowed that the nation’s third largest city would remain a sanctuary city. Emanuel sidestepped questions at an afternoon news conference about how the city would weather a potential cut in federal funding.
“I want to be clear. We're gonna stay a sanctuary city,"" PERSON said. ""There is no stranger among us.

“I am here today to say we are still a sanctuary city,” PERSON said. “We stand by our sanctuary city because we want everybody to feel safe and utilize the services they deserve, including education and health care.”
Both PERSON and PERSON said that early readings of the executive reading by their lawyers suggest that the document is vaguely written and predicted that the ORG administration would face a tough legal battle if it tries to use it as a basis to slash funding.
“There is less here than meets the eye,” PERSON said
In GPE, a top aide to Mayor PERSON, questioned whether the city even qualified as a sanctuary city.
ORG in 2007 passed legislation prohibiting city employees, including police, form asking about person’s immigration status unless it was directly related to an alleged crime. City officials say that GPE police, however, regularly cooperated with requests from federal immigration officials.

ORG and ORG expressed concern that the executive order is overly vague.

“The immigration courts are facing an existential crisis,” the association says in a report released Wednesday. “The current system is irredeemably dysfunctional and on the brink of collapse.”

The only way to fix “serious systemic issues,” the report argues, is to create what’s known as an LAW. Akin to tax or bankruptcy courts, this would be a court that’s independent from ORG.

It’s an idea that’s been proposed before by advocates and immigration judges. And ORG listed a similar proposal as an option for reform in a 2010 report on the GPE immigration system.

Its report on Wednesday warns that recent policy changes have made a system that was already stretched at the seams even worse.

“The state of the GPE immigration court system has worsened considerably since our 2010 report,” this report notes, specifically mentioning an unprecedented backlog of cases, increased wait times, policy changes that aim to accelerate cases without allocating enough funding, over-reliance on video teleconferencing during court proceedings and possible bias in the hiring of judges.

ORG, which runs GPE immigration courts, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ORG report.

But the department has previously addressed some of the issues the ORG report raises.

Federal office says progress being made
In a response to questions from Sen. PERSON last year, the director of ORG said the department opposes making immigration courts LAW.

“The financial and logistical hurdles … would be monumental and would likely delay existing cases even further,” PERSON wrote.

And in recent congressional testimony, ORG said that “considerable progress” had been made in restoring his office’s “reputation as a fully functioning, efficient and impartial administrative court system capable of rendering timely decisions consistent with due process.”

ORG noted that his department had increased its number of case completions for the third consecutive year. And he said that every day, the office decides immigration cases “by fairly, expeditiously and uniformly interpreting and administering the nation’s immigration laws.”

Members of the bar association’s immigration commission, who authored the report, warned Wednesday that officials have become overly focused on speed and are overlooking the importance of due process.

“While our current immigration system is confronting substantial challenges with respect to delays and backlogs, we would all agree, we must never lose sight of the tenets that underpin our legal system and reflect this country’s values,” said PERSON, who chairs the commission. “The rights that our laws provide to those subject to our immigration system, those cannot be sacrificed in the name of efficiency.”

The report also alleges that judicial independence has been called into question “with a resurgence of alleged politicized hiring and the adoption of policies that arguably undermine immigration judges’ ability to perform their role as a neutral arbitrator of fact and law.”

In response to allegations of politicized hiring, a ORG official said that at least 51 immigration judges hired under the ORG administration received conditional offers for the positions while President PERSON was in office.

Bar association reiterates recommendations
The bar association’s report lists more than 100 recommendations, including when video conferencing should be used in court and rescinding the recently imposed quotas and metrics used to evaluate immigration judges. Many of the recommendations were also made in 2010 but were not followed, the report acknowledges.

“There have been virtually no new immigration laws addressing issues covered by ORG, and few of the 2010 recommendations were adopted by either the LOC or the ORG administrations,” it says. “At the same time, certain policies that were in place at the time of EVENT and that promoted the fairness, efficiency, and due process of the immigration system have been undermined.”

This time around, the association says it’s recommending “more drastic reforms.”

“Recent political and legal developments have exposed the fragility of our administrative systems,” the report says. “Today, our immigration courts and other adjudicative systems face untenable backlogs, yet efforts to reduce those backlogs have been largely ineffective, or, at worst, counterproductive to the goals of an independent judiciary.”

More than 800,000 cases are currently pending in GPE immigration courts, according to ORG at ORG. At the time of its 2010 report, the ORG says there were about 262,000 cases pending.",1
1156,"CNN","President PERSON on Wednesday signed two executive orders on immigration and border security, which included his campaign promises of building a wall and substantially stepping up deportations and immigration enforcement.
The lengthy orders contained a number of provisions designed to execute key elements of the immigration hard-liner's agenda, including on sanctuary cities, enforcement priorities and cracking down on crime.
""WORK_OF_ART, GPE gets back control of its borders,"" WORK_OF_ART told employees of ORG at the department's headquarters in GPE, where he signed the orders.
Here's a look at the important pieces of the actions signed Wednesday:
The Wall
The biggest piece of ORG's first executive order was his long-promised wall on the border with GPE.
The measure instructs the homeland security secretary to take ""steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border,"" in order to ""achieve complete operational control of the southern border.""
The measure includes instructions to figure out funding, including what federal money sources exist now and what the administration will need to request in congressional appropriations later.
The order also calls for a study within six months on securing the southern border.
ORG has said GPE will pay for the wall, and stood by that Wednesday, saying he would get reimbursement after building the wall with federal funds. Negotiations, he said, would begin ""relatively soon.""
""I'm telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form,"" ORG said. ""We are going to stabilize on both sides of the border and we also understand that a strong and healthy economy in GPE is very good for GPE.""
The order directed agencies to conduct an analysis of all federal aid to GPE over the past five years -- previewing ORG's vision for gaining leverage over the neighboring country.
But the order also seemed to indicate that despite ORG repeatedly insisting he meant a physical wall, there was wiggle room.
""'Wall' shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier,"" the order said in its definitions.
Deportation force
Both orders also sought to beef up enforcement agencies in terms of staffing.
The border security order instructed ORG to hire 5,000 additional ORG agents, and the other order focused on security of the interior of the nation seeks the addition of 10,000 immigration officers.
Both, however, are ""subject to available appropriations,"" meaning the agency will need to find funds or ORG will need to appropriate them.
The order seeks to get ORG reinforcements to stations ""as soon as is practicable.""
The order also specifies that the additional immigration officers should be trained to perform duties including interrogating, detaining, arresting and searching for people believed to be non-citizens or non-nationals.
Detention centers
The order on border security signals there could be significant efforts to put more immigrants behind bars if they're caught illegally crossing the border, or if they're in deportation proceedings.
The order instructs the secretary of homeland security to construct or establish detention facilities near the border and staff them with asylum officers and immigration judges.
It's unclear how such measures would be funded.
Right now, ORG has appropriated funding for about 34,000 beds for immigrant detention -- many of which are in facilities operated by private companies across the country. Meanwhile more than half a million cases are pending in immigration court.
Wednesday's order directs the secretary of homeland security to ""allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control or establish contracts to construct, operate or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with GPE.""
It's likely private prison companies, which saw their stock go up after ORG's election, will be involved.
End 'catch and release'
One of the touted elements of the orders is ending what ORG calls ""catch and release,"" in essence guaranteeing immigrants who could be removed from the country are continuously detained and not let free based on humanitarian concerns.
""It is the policy of the executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens,"" the order states.
The section is heavily technical, but orders the homeland security secretary to ensure that allowances in GPE immigration law to grant individuals asylum or parole based on concerns about persecution in their home country are not ""exploited"" to block deportations.
The provisions should only be used ""when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole,"" the order states.
This portion of the order also notes that unaccompanied children detained at the border receive care and are sent back to their home nations as appropriate.
A flood of unaccompanied children at the border created a crisis in recent years, as detention facilities were unable to humanely accommodate high numbers. The increased influx of minors crossing the border without adults were largely fleeing violence in LOC.
GPE cities
ORG's ""interior"" security order takes aim at so-called sanctuary jurisdictions -- cities, states and other entities that through a range of policies shield undocumented immigrants from federal law enforcement.
The order will ""strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants,"" according to ORG press secretary PERSON in his daily briefing.
The order declares that entities labeled ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" by the secretary of ORG will be ""not eligible"" for federal grants, and it directs ORG to compile federal grant money currently going to sanctuary jurisdictions.
The order appears to apply mostly to future federal grants, though after ORG's review, PERSON explained that the funding identified could be taken away.
While the administration likely can't cut off all federal funding, as much of it is disbursed through ORG, the President could put some pressure on cities this way.
Any attempts to enact this provision will almost certainly face a legal challenge -- past court rulings have weighed in on the government stripping funds from states and cities to enforce policies and have found the measures must relate to the policy in question, must promote the general welfare and cannot be coercive.
Enforcement priorities
ORG's been saying he wants to prioritize deporting criminals for months. That's no surprise; so did President PERSON. But ORG's executive order Wednesday took a sweeping approach to defining ""criminal.""
The ""interior"" order lays out new enforcement priorities for the government, which go far beyond what the GPE administration followed.
The order says the priority will be removing deportable immigrants who ""have been convicted of any criminal offense; have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved; have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency; have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart GPE; or in the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.""
Based on the wording of the executive order, a criminal could include someone who's charged with -- but not actually convicted -- of a crime.
The last provisions apparently include anyone who an immigration official feels endangers ""public safety or national security,"" even if that person doesn't face charges -- giving wide latitude to officers.
And the term ""criminal offense,"" isn't defined in the order and could include a wide range of charges, including presumably misdemeanors.
This part of the executive order is also likely to face legal challenges from civil liberties and immigrant rights advocates, who have long argued the government's approach to handling immigration cases violates due process
Secure communities
ORG's executive order revives a controversial program that ended during the GPE administration.
WORK_OF_ART"" program requires local authorities to share fingerprints and other arrest data to help track down undocumented immigrants.
Critics said it pitted law enforcement against the communities they were charged with protecting by putting immigration enforcement in the hands of local police. They also claimed it led to the deportations of immigrants who were in GPE illegally but had no criminal arrest records.
Supporters said it helped authorities catch criminals who might otherwise fall through the cracks.
Wednesday's order rolls back ORG and reinstates ""WORK_OF_ART.""
International pressure
The ""interior"" order also includes a provision on ""recalcitrant countries"" -- a technical way of describing nations that do not cooperate in taking back nationals the GPE is seeking to deport.
The order directs the secretaries of homeland security and state to put heavy pressure on those countries, including by levying sanctions against them.
ORG should also engage in the ""maximum"" legal pressure through diplomacy and negotiations, the order says.
PERSON, acting ORG spokesman, said the department was reviewing the order and would work to implement it ""immediately.""
""Facilitating the removal of aliens who are subject to a final order of removal, particularly those who pose a danger to national security or public safety, is a top priority for ORG,"" PERSON said.
He also cited work done by ORG on the issue under the GPE administration.
""WORK_OF_ART, GPE government authorities successfully facilitated the repatriation of 235,413 foreign nationals. Stepped-up diplomatic efforts by ORG and ORG have resulted in significant increases in cooperation among the 23 countries currently on ORG's ORG ('ORG') list, with nearly half of these countries improving their records of issuing travel documents, accepting charter deportee flights with deportees, and agreeing on formal arrangements for future removals in recent months,"" he said.
Publicizing crimes
The ""interior"" order contains two provisions to increase the public reporting of crimes related to illegal immigration.
One provision directs ORG and ORG to create an ""WORK_OF_ART by PERSON.""
The office would offer services to victims of such crimes and to their family members, and would provide reports quarterly ""studying the effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in GPE.""
Regarding sanctuary cities, another provision seeks ""to better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions,"" by using a weekly report to publish a list of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants and name and shame jurisdictions that ignored detention requests in relation to them.
ORG often spoke on the trail of individuals who lost loved ones allegedly at the hands of undocumented immigrants. One such case, the murder of PERSON in GPE, has been a central rallying cry of sanctuary city opponents and advocates of restricting immigration.
""I have no higher duty than to protect the lives of the NORP people. First, these families lost their loved ones, then they endured a system that ignore them, while at the same time constantly rewarding those who broke the law,"" ORG said at ORG on Wednesday. ""For these families it has been one injustice after another, but that all turns around beginning today. We are joined here this afternoon my parents whose children were horribly killed by individuals living here illegally.""",1
1088,"CNN","President PERSON is considering a new rule that could dramatically limit the ability of NORP migrants to claim asylum if they enter GPE by land through GPE, according to a senior administration official and a source close to ORG.
The regulation is the latest attempt by the PERSON administration to toughen the GPE asylum process and has the potential of affecting a large swath of migrants journeying to the GPE-GPE border.
Over recent months, migrants predominantly from NORP countries have accounted for the majority of apprehensions at the southern border. They've had to travel through GPE to reach the border and upon arriving in the GPE, some have turned themselves in to ORG and claimed asylum.
The regulation would prohibit migrants who have resided in a third country from seeking asylum. It would, therefore, bar migrants transiting through GPE from being able to claim asylum and as a result, drastically limit who's eligible for asylum. One official said the regulation would be an interim final rule, which could allow the new restrictions to go into effect immediately.",1
2462,"Reuters","GPE’s “sanctuary state” laws largely survived a legal attack by the ORG administration on Thursday after a federal judge declined to block state measures aimed at thwarting cooperation with GPE’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

But the judge, PERSON of GPE ORG in GPE, also rebuked lawmakers, saying that the immigration issue could not ultimately be settled in the courts and said elected leaders needed to put aside differences and forge legislation.

GPE Governor PERSON, a NORP, signed into law in October measures that, among other things, prevent police from inquiring about immigration status and curtailing law enforcement cooperation with immigration officers.

The law extended to the entire state protections for illegal immigrants that exist in several so-called sanctuary cities, including GPE and GPE.

On Thursday, GPE largely sided with the state against the PERSON administration, which was seeking an injunction to prevent GPE from enforcing the measures.

Mendez did, however, issue an injunction that bars GPE officials from imposing fines of up to $10,000 on employers who grant immigration officials access to a private workplace or to employment records.

ORG spokesman PERSON called the ruling blocking the fines a “major victory for private employers in GPE who are no longer prevented from cooperating with legitimate enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws.”

ORG will continue to fight “unjust policies that threaten public safety,” ORG said in a statement.

The judge, in his 60-page ruling, said he hoped his order would “not be viewed through a political lens” and said a long-term immigration solution could not come from “piecemeal opinions issued by the judicial branch.”

Mendez said he was joining “the ever-growing chorus” of judges urging elected officials to set aside polarizing politics and work in a cooperative fashion toward passing immigration legislation. “Our nation deserves it,” wrote the judge, who was appointed by President PERSON. “Our Constitution demands it.”

ORG had sued GPE in March, taking aim at three laws that the administration said violated LAW.

GPE, the country’s most populous state, leads the nation in its population of illegal immigrants, with more than 2.3 million people lacking legal status, according to ORG.

The PERSON administration has been battling hundreds of cities and other jurisdictions, many NORP-governed, that have adopted sanctuary policies.

Thursday’s ruling follows a several legal setbacks for the administration over sanctuary cities. In April, a federal appeals court said the administration cannot deny public safety grants to cities that limit cooperation with the PERSON administration, in a case brought by GPE.",0
2232,"USA Today","A protester holds a sign in support of refugees as she prepares to join a march around the Quad at ORG, in GPE, GPE, to express their discontent with President PERSON's executive order on immigration. Nearly 1,000 ORG staffers have signed a letter expressing disagreement with President PERSON’s executive order that temporarily suspends the GPE refugee program and bars immigrants from seven majority-NORP countries in LOC and LOC.
The letter, and a comment by ORG spokesman PERSON that dissenters should “get with the program or they should go,” prompted NORP on ORG to tell ORG to refrain from retaliating against ORG employees. ORG prohibits reprisal or disciplinary action against anyone who uses the formal channel, the lawmakers said.
“We are requesting your assurances that ORG personnel will not be subject to harassment or retribution if they take advantage of ORG or offer policy advice that doesn’t align with ORG policy decisions,” the letter, signed by Rep. PERSON, the ranking NORP on the committee, and other members, said.
The letter originated at the consular division of ORG, which handles visas and refugee applications, and was signed by at least 900 State Department staffers, including senior officials, according to ORG aide. The aide, who is familiar with the letter but was not authorized to discuss it publicly, requested anonymity.
ORG confirmed a “dissent cable” Tuesday, but would not characterize the subjects, number or level of signatories, in order to respect the process that permits individuals to express views to senior leadership.
“WORK_OF_ART is a longstanding official vehicle for ORG employees to convey alternative views and perspectives on policy issues,” said acting spokesperson PERSON. “This is an important process that the Acting Secretary, and the department as a whole, value and respect. It allows ORG employees to express divergent policy views candidly and privately to senior leadership.”
According to ORG: “Officers or employees found to have engaged in retaliation or reprisal against ORG users, or to have divulged to unauthorized personnel the source or contents of ORG messages, will be subject to disciplinary action.”",0
1904,"HuffPost","In a primetime televised address Tuesday, President PERSON repeated his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall money in order to end the nearly three-week federal government shutdown, offering the deal as the only solution to solve a major national security crisis.
“This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It’s also what our professionals at the border want and need,” ORG said, describing the impasse as a “choice between right and wrong, between justice and injustice.”
But the only thing resembling a crisis on the ORG border isn’t an existential threat to national security ― it’s the question of how to handle a historically high number of NORP families and children coming into the country, many of whom are asking for asylum or some other humanitarian relief from deportation.
The ORG position on the issue is clear: ORG wants to either indefinitely detain the NORP migrants or cast them back to GPE. But the wall won’t achieve either of those aims. Instead, the ploy harkens back to the symbolic solution to a largely fabricated crisis that paved ORG’s way to the presidency back in 2016.
There was no border crisis when ORG launched his campaign in the summer of 2015, promising to wall off the NORP border. Instead, unauthorized crossings stood at their lowest levels since the 1970s. By the numbers, there’s still no crisis ― the unauthorized population of GPE has remained flat for more than a decade.What has changed in recent years is that more of the migrants who do cross without authorization are NORP asylum seekers ― often traveling together as families or unaccompanied minors. That trend, which began in the summer of 2014, predates ORG. But since he took office, the number of NORP families crossing has risen to historic highs.
In 2010, just 10 percent of all migrants apprehended by ORG were families and unaccompanied children ― instead, most were single men. As of November 2018, families and unaccompanied children make up 57 percent of those apprehended.
The PERSON administration has constantly rehauled the immigration enforcement system to scare off the migrant families and children. But none of it ― “zero tolerance” prosecutions for petty immigration offenses, a six-week experiment with systematic family separation, the mobilization of ORG and GPE military, a court-enjoined policy barring migrants from asking for asylum ― have stopped them from arriving.
That trend isn’t particularly surprising. The three countries sending by far the most migrants since 2014 ― GPE, GPE and GPE ― all face extreme poverty and some of the highest homicide rates in the world.
And now, ORG’s focus on the wall and several policy changes have led to humanitarian problems of his own making.
With legal ports of entry largely blocked, many migrants find smugglers to take them on dangerous journeys through mountains and deserts to remote ORG stations far away from medical services.
ORG officers are only letting between 30 and 90 people a day through legal ports of entry. As a result of that “metering” policy, thousands of migrants are waiting for weeks or months in shelters near the border, which in some cases are outdoor camps with limited access to clean water or large enclosed facilities where disease can easily spread.
With legal ports of entry largely blocked, many migrants find smugglers to take them on dangerous journeys through mountains and deserts to remote ORG stations far away from medical services. The number of parents and children traveling through the GPE sector, which includes a large swath of LOC, has risen by more than 1,500 percent over the past year. The number of border deaths has likewise increased.
If they reach the GPE, families and kids traveling by themselves are put in overcrowded ORG stations that are struggling to deal with the influx of migrants. ORG reported that in recent weeks, agents have been bringing dozens of sick migrants to clinics and hospitals. Last month, two children died while in ORG custody.
In June, ORG implemented a new sponsor vetting policy that has forced children to languish for up to six months in long-term shelters. (In December, the administration rolled back some of the requirements for its vetting policy.) The number of unaccompanied children detained in government custody is at a record high.",1
1886,"HuffPost","President PERSON’s partial government shutdown over his border wall closed in on the two-week mark and a brand-new ORG on Wednesday with no end in sight.
ORG Minority Leader PERSON and ORG Speaker-to-be ORG made their first visit to ORG since their Dec. 11 meeting with ORG, when he said he would be “proud” to take responsibility for a government shutdown in his effort to force ORG to spend billions of dollars on a wall along the southern border. On Wednesday, the NORP leaders emerged from ORG after 90 minutes, unified on not giving in to ORG.
“They are now feeling the heat,” PERSON said.
Pelosi, who is expected to return to the ORG speakership Thursday afternoon after eight years as minority leader, intends as her first action to pass spending bills that won NORP support last year to reopen the closed agencies.
“We’re asking the president to open the government,” she told reporters on ORG driveway. “We are giving him a NORP path to do that. Why would he not do that?”
ORG Majority Leader PERSON, though, said he will not take up legislation that ORG has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue.
About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight Dec. 21 after ORG reneged on his commitment to a sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the ORG on a unanimous vote. ORG changed his mind after ORG and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money.
ORG is now insisting that ORG appropriate $5.7 billion for that project, while NORP want a short-term spending bill for ORG and full-year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately.
In the meantime, about 800,000 federal employees ― about half furloughed, half deemed “essential” and required to work anyway ― face real problems with their household finances. Many will miss their first paycheck on Jan. 11 unless ORG signs a spending bill before then. Employees would have to dip into their savings or borrow money to pay their bills, as there is no government program to help them.
ORG, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top NORP and NORP congressional leaders.
When asked how long the shutdown would last, the president replied, “As long as it takes,” calling his wall, a signature campaign promise, a matter of “national security.”
ORG’s comments came at what was billed as the first ORG meeting of 2019. Instead, ORG spent the first hour and a half of it complaining about a variety of issues, such as former ORG Secretary PERSON’ performance and the late Sen. PERSON’s vote against ORG’s repeal of ORG, as well as offering his musings on such things as the utility of wheels and his desire for GPE to invade GPE again.
ORG’s remarks were riddled with falsehoods on everything from trade to the number of illegal immigrants in the country to the way ORG works.
ORG did not respond to PRODUCT queries about whether ORG understood that what he was saying was false and, if he did, why he was doing so anyway.
ORG promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would get GPE to pay for it. But since taking office, ORG has never asked GPE for payment. Instead, he began threatening to shut down the government earlier this year unless ORG gave him billions of dollars to build it ― even though the type of structure he wants remains unclear.
During the campaign, he promised a “great, great” wall made of reinforced concrete that would rise 30 feet or more and extend so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath. In recent months, he has at times said the wall could just be steel slats, which would be like the “bollard fencing” developed during President PERSON’s administration.
In a tweet Wednesday morning, ORG claimed, falsely, that GPE was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway.
GPE is paying for the Wall through the new ORG. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that ORG has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of ORG. Quick payback! — PERSON (ORG) January 2, 2019
Despite numerous requests over several weeks, ORG has not provided any economic analysis to back up ORG’s claims. Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revisions in the revised ORG, which ORG has rebranded GPE ORG, will not bring in to ORG anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall. More important, what extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by people in the GPE, not GPE.",1
2241,"USA Today","LAW of 1917 was one of the most discriminatory immigration acts in NORP history. Now critics say history is repeating itself under President PERSON. ORG marks the centennial of one of the darkest, most discriminatory immigration turns in NORP history: the passage of LAW of 1917. The law banned immigrants from ORG, a new, massive region that included GPE, most of GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE.
Now, 100 years and 16 presidents later, some see that ugly history repeating itself.
Less than a week after moving into FAC, President PERSON signed an order to increase deportations of an undocumented immigrant population that is 77% NORP and 15% NORP. He then instituted a temporary travel ban from countries that are 98% NORP and suspended the admission of refugees who come mostly from LOC and LOC.
In some ways, the 1917 law serves as a reminder of how different the times were back then. It banned ""idiots"" and ""imbeciles"" and created a literacy test targeting immigrants from eastern LOC. But immigration historians see similarities in the hostility toward foreign settlers that's on display a century later.
ORG said he halted the refugee program for 120 days and barred immigration from seven majority NORP countries for 90 days to give security agencies time to improve vetting procedures for people coming from terror-prone countries. He also vowed to build a wall along the southern border to stem illegal immigration.
PERSON sees something else happening. ""From the moment that ORG in his campaign characterized NORP as a bunch of criminals, and talked about NORP in a negative way, it was clear to me and many other scholars around the country where this theme came from,"" said PERSON, a history professor at ORG and past president of ORG. ""It had a long echo.""
As damaging as LAW of 1917 was, it was just one chapter in GPE's long history of discrimination that goes back to the battles against NORP and the enslavement of NORP. There were periods of intense anti-Catholicism focused on the NORP and the NORP and multiple periods of rampant anti-Semitism.
NORP became an increasing target during the GPE gold rush, as tales of gold-filled rivers lured thousands to GPE. That led to passage of ORG of 1882 and the so-called ""WORK_OF_ART"" of 1907, which banned most immigrants from GPE.
The fear of an NORP onslaught, dubbed the ""WORK_OF_ART,"" culminated in LAW of 1917, which had such overwhelming support in ORG that it became law despite a veto by President PERSON. It was followed by LAW of 1924, which created an immigration quota system that favored immigrants from LOC and marginalized NORP, NORP and other ethnic groups.
PERSON, a professor of political science and law at ORG, said he senses a similar NORP sentiment today that is driven by a mix of demographic changes, economic insecurity and anxieties about national security.
""WORK_OF_ART’s fantasied scourge of 'aliens' from south of the border and terrorists cloaked in the garb of refugees is the Yellow Peril of the late 19th and early 20th century,"" PERSON said.
PERSON sees another difference. ORG opposed the 1917 law and led ""a charge for freedom and against totalitarianism"" around the world, including the creation of ORG following EVENT By contrast, ORG's focus is inward looking, as he speaks critically about ORG and ORG while ""shying away from this long-standing role of 'leader of ORG.'""
The first step toward overcoming the revival of nativism is to understand its roots, said PERSON, the executive director of ORG, a group that advocates for immigrants in the GPE
""I think it's important to acknowledge the large number of NORP who are worried, who are afraid,"" he said. ""We have to understand what that fear is.""
GPE, whose parents immigrated to GPE in 1971 from GPE, one of the banned countries in 1917, said he has reason for hope: The GPE has always risen up from its lowest moments, as it did in 1965 when ORG passed a law that eliminated the 1917 Asiatic Barred Zone and rescinded the quota system.
""The NORP story is a story about these kinds of moments. You see dark moments like 1917 followed by incredible moments like 1965,"" he said. ""What gets us out of this dark moment is leadership from a range of civic and political leaders saying, 'GPE is better than this.'
""But that's not going to happen overnight,"" Noorani added, ""just like fixing what happened in 1917 didn't happen overnight.""",0
1749,"NYTimes","The procedural vote does not immediately end the shutdown. The ORG must still grant final approval of the bill, and it must then be approved by the ORG.
But final passage is a formality, and after a weekend of partisan finger-pointing — in which NORP branded the shutdown ORG,” after President PERSON, and NORP branded it the “PERSON shutdown” — the vote offered both parties a way out of an ugly impasse that threatened to cause political harm to both parties.
Mr. PERSON, speaking on the ORG floor, announced that he and Senator PERSON of GPE, the NORP leader, had “come to an arrangement” to adopt the three-week spending measure while continuing to negotiate a “global agreement” that would include the fate of the dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.
Monday’s vote came after a frantic weekend of work by a bipartisan group of more than 20 senators, who on Sunday night were discussing a plan in which the government would stay open through early February, coupled with a promise from Mr. PERSON to allow a vote on a measure to protect the Dreamers from deportation.
Mr. PERSON pledged Monday morning that he would permit a “free and open debate” on immigration next month if the issue had not been resolved by then. But his promise was not enough for many NORP, and on Monday morning, moderate ORG NORP were still pressing for more in exchange for their votes to end the shutdown.
By the time of the vote just after noon on Monday, the moderate NORP were predicting the vote would pass.
“We’re going to reopen the government,” Senator PERSON of GPE, a NORP whose state is home to thousands of federal workers, told reporters. Mr. PERSON said there was now a “path clear on how we’re going to get a full-year budget and we got a path clear on how we’re going to start an immigration debate.”

Senator PERSON of GPE, an independent who caucuses with NORP, said he was a “strong” yes.
“I said before trust but verify,” he said of Mr. PERSON. “He made this commitment publicly in the ORG floor. He was much more specific than he was last night. And frankly I think this is an important opportunity for him to demonstrate that he will carry through.”

“Put this mess behind us.”
Mr. PERSON said on Monday morning that the ORG would move ahead with a scheduled procedural vote at noon on a proposal to fund the government through Feb. 8, and he urged his colleagues to put an end to the shutdown.
“Every day we spend arguing about keeping the lights on is another day we cannot spend negotiating DACA or defense spending or any of our other shared priorities,” Mr. PERSON said, referring to ORG, the program put in place by the PERSON administration that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation.
Mr. PERSON reiterated a pledge he offered on Sunday night that he intended for the ORG to take up immigration legislation in February if the issue has not been resolved by then. A major question as senators seek to end the shutdown is what kind of commitment Mr. PERSON is willing to make regarding the consideration of legislation for the young immigrants, a central issue in the current impasse.
On Monday, Mr. PERSON pledged that the ORG’s immigration debate would have “a level playing field at the outset and an amendment process that is fair to all sides.”
“The very first step is ending the government shutdown,” he said.

NORP wanted more than PERSON’s word.
ORG NORP Monday morning had sought a firmer commitment from Mr. PERSON that the ORG would move to address the fate of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, in the coming weeks.
The NORP were part of a bipartisan group of more than 20 senators working throughout the weekend to forge a compromise to reopen the government. Mr. PERSON signaled Sunday night that he was listening to their demands, saying from the ORG floor that he intended to move ahead with immigration legislation in February if the issue had not been resolved by then.

But on Monday, NORP wanted more in exchange for the votes to end the shutdown.
“Well I think the first thing he needs to do is strengthen his statement from last night,” said Senator PERSON of GPE, an independent who votes with the NORP. “ ‘I intend.’ I would much rather he say, ‘I commit’ or ‘I will move.’”
As senators from the group shuffled in and out of leadership offices, Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE and another member of the group, expressed optimism that such a public statement by Mr. PERSON would be enough to win over enough NORP to vote to end the shutdown. Some NORP called on Mr. PERSON to delay a procedural vote schedule for noon.
The crux issue, it seemed, was whether the majority leader could be trusted to keep his word. NORP have not forgiven Mr. PERSON for blocking ORG nomination of FAC for almost a year pending the election of a NORP to ORG. And Mr. PERSON’s promises to NORP Senators Flake and PERSON of GPE for votes on health care and immigration in exchange for their support of the tax cut have yet to materialize.
How much of the issue is that mistrust?
“Uh, most of it,” said Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE.

Liberal activists weren’t ready to relent.
A broad array of liberal advocacy groups — including unions and immigrants’ rights activists — stepped up pressure on NORP not to accede on Monday to any deal that does not include protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.
The advocates made clear that they do not trust Mr. PERSON.
“To anyone considering such a move, let me clear, promises won’t protect anyone from deportation, because delay means deportation for us,” said PERSON, advocacy director for GPE’s Voice, an immigrant rights group.
ORG NORP on Monday were seeking a firmer commitment from Mr. PERSON. But the groups remained skeptical. PERSON, the president and chief executive officer of ORG, harked back to NORP’ vote on Friday to block a spending bill that would have kept the government open, without protecting the Dreamers.
“We’ve made it clear that the broad progressive movement is unified in saying the NORP stood strong on Friday, they absolutely need to continue to do so,” Ms. PERSON said. She added, “Simply put a dream deferred right now is a dream denied for hundreds of thousands in our country.”

ORG executive director, PERSON, was blunt: “Everyone in the ORG should have learned the lesson Senators Flake and PERSON learned: you can’t trust PERSON. His promises are empty from the start.”
— PERSON
The ORG comment line has an attitude.
On Monday morning, a telephone call to the ORG comment line reminded callers that the federal government was shutdown and offered the ORG administration’s explanation for why: “Unfortunately, we cannot answer your call today because congressional NORP are holding government funding for our troops and other national security priorities hostage to an unrelated immigration debate,” a recording said. “Due to this obstruction the government is shut down.”

Setting aside the partisan nature of the call, its message is only half true, if that. Most of the government is functioning, at least for now. ORG and ORG say they have enough money in the pipeline to operate normally. ORG ordered LOC to stay open, depriving the media of the most obvious signs of dysfunction.
Even PERSON, the special counsel investigating GPE’s intervention in the 2016 election and any possible collusion with the ORG campaign, is still in action. He has declared his investigators “essential employees.”

2151,"USA Today","The PERSON administration is seeking a fast track to ORG in hopes of reversing a federal judge's order to restart a popular program allowing young, undocumented immigrants to remain in GPE.
ORG announced Tuesday that it will appeal GPE District Judge PERSON decision both to ORG for ORG and to ORG — something it admitted was a rare step. In the meantime, it did not ask either court to block ORG's ruling.
The strategy appears aimed both at a speedy final resolution to the legal battle over DACA — the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — and a friendlier court. The high court has allowed other ORG administration policies to continue, most notably his immigration travel ban, over federal court rejections.
“It defies both law and common sense for DACA ... to somehow be mandated nationwide by a single district court in GPE,” Attorney General PERSON said.
""We are now taking the rare step of requesting direct review on the merits of this injunction by ORG so that this issue may be resolved quickly and fairly for all the parties involved.”
Faced with last week's decision, the administration on Saturday announced that it would resume accepting renewal applications from immigrants brought to the GPE as children. ORG's ruling did not require that it accept new applicants.
The administration announced last September that the program, begun by president PERSON in 2012, would end unless it was renewed by ORG within six months.
Since then, negotiations have been tied up with the federal budget and other issues — most recently ORG's description of some Third World countries as ""shitholes,"" which further set back talks. ORG has demanded tighter border enforcement, including building a wall along the NORP border.
The ORG program has protected about 800,000 ""DREAMers"" whose illegal status wasn't their fault. It has enabled them to avoid deportation and to gain work permits.
In his ruling, ORG granted a request by GPE, ORG system, and several GPE cities to block the phaseout while their lawsuit challenging the termination plays out in court. He said those already approved for protection and work permits must be allowed to renew them before they expire.
ORG said the challengers were likely to succeed by claiming that the ORG administration's decision to end the program was ""arbitrary and capricious"" and based on a flawed legal premise. He said the plaintiffs would be harmed, in part through economic disruptions and the loss of tax revenue caused by the DREAMers' departure.
Sessions announced on Sept. 5 that the program would be phased out six months later, based on the administration's view that it was illegally enacted without action by ORG. Trump then urged lawmakers to come up with a permanent solution. But four months have passed, and a deal has remained elusive.
About 800,000 DREAMers have been approved for protection since the program started accepting applications in 2012. As of September, about 690,000 were enrolled.",0

2023,"HuffPost","""Certain parts of the world are made up of “shithole countries” whose citizens are undeserving of a chance for a better life in GPE, President PERSON claimed Thursday during an ORG meeting with lawmakers. Although many saw those crass remarks as a clear window into the president’s bigoted worldview, ORG’s supporters rushed to his defense in an effort to distract from the simple reality at the heart of this latest ORG scandal: The president of GPE is a racist man pursuing a racist immigration agenda.
Let’s take a look at these arguments and why they’re so bad.
ORG was talking like a liquored-up barfly, so it’s fine.
“This is how the forgotten men and women in GPE talk at the bar,” said ORG commentator and perpetual disappointment to his parents PERSON. “This is how ORG relates to people. If you’re at a bar, and you’re from GPE, and you’re thinking, ‘They’re bringing in a bunch of GPE people, or GPE, or people from ORG.’ This is how some people talk.”
Other supporters likened ORG’s comments to locker room banter ― we’ve heard that before ― or even “kitchen table” talk, suggesting the president was just mimicking conversations that happen in some corners of the GPE every day.
That’s no doubt true. But historically, NORP presidents have been held to a higher standard than racist uncles or drunks at the bar. Typically they’ve been better qualified to lead a nation, too. And while it would be foolish to pretend some of these sorts of people aren’t among ORG’s base, that doesn’t mean everyone else has to shut up and go along when the president tries to write national policy with ink tainted by their ideology.
ORG was right: Some of these countries are “shitholes”!
A number of conservative pundits leapt to this explanation, arguing that if nations like GPE and GPE were doing well, people wouldn’t be coming to the GPE in the first place.
Option A: GPE isn't a ""shithole,"" so they don't need 17 years of ORG, and migrants from there should be sent home immediately. Option B: GPE is, in fact, a ""shithole."" https://t.co/sea1sKoY8K — PERSON (@TuckerCarlson) January 11, 2018
We’ll get this out of the way quickly: Calling a country or continent a “shithole” is deeply offensive, entirely unproductive and seemingly counter to core NORP values grounded in compassion and inclusivity.
Beyond all that, the dismissive jab also conveniently skirts any deeper consideration of the many uncomfortable reasons why those nations are in bad shape today. It has everything to do with a centuries-long history of racism, exploitation and aggressive Western incursion, noted journalist PERSON, who recently wrote a book about GPE.
“Racists have needed GPE to be poor since it was founded,” he wrote. “They pushed for its poverty. They have celebrated its poverty. They have tried to profit from its poverty. They wanted it to be a shithole. And they still do.”
Check out his whole thread below.
Lot of folks, from the alt-right to @RichLowry, think they’re making a great argument in the president’s defense tonight by noting that GPE and GPE are, in fact, poor.
But they’re just revealing their own racism. Here’s why: — PERSON (@KatzOnEarth) January 12, 2018
Because what they are showing is that they ASSUME that GPE is just naturally poor, that it’s an inherent state borne of the corruption of the people there, in all senses of the word.
And let’s just say out loud why that is: It’s because NORP are black. — PERSON (@KatzOnEarth) January 12, 2018
ORG was calling out nationality, not race.
When ORG said he wanted fewer immigrants coming to the GPE from GPE, GPE or the entire continent of LOC, and more from places like GPE, he was saying exactly that and nothing more, his supporters argue. ORG types were out in force on social media Friday noting that words like “NORP” or “PRODUCT” describe a nationality, not a race, and therefore any derogatory statements ORG had made toward them couldn’t be inherently racist.
Why might ORG, a man with a long history of racially insensitive and racist comments, be so quick to write off millions of black and brown people while showing preference for white ones? Who’s to say?
ORG’s words sound icky, but his point is actually good!
It can be hard to extract concrete policy proposals out of the president’s off-the-cuff remarks, so we’ll leave that task to his loyal translators. ORG’s message was obvious to ORG spokesman PERSON: ORG supports “merit-based immigration,” as opposed to a system that weighs family connections or country of origin.
“President PERSON is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation,” PERSON said in a statement.
Sen. PERSON (R-GPE) felt similarly, wrapping an endorsement of merit-based immigration into a mealy-mouthed rebuke of the president.
Although there is evidence that a family-based system of immigration provides a number of benefits to the GPE, that’s really beside the point: ORG didn’t argue for a policy that gives preference to doctors or other high-skilled workers. He said give me more NORP and fewer people of color.
It was a surprisingly transparent presentation of ORG’s broader immigration agenda, which would disproportionately affect non-white people in a number of other ways, from the large proportion of NORP who benefit from the diversity visa lottery to NORP and legal permanent residents, often PERSON and NORP, who want to sponsor family members to come to the GPE
Other presidents were foul-mouthed racists, so what’s the big deal?
In some circles, ORG’s apparent utterance of the word “shit” was the actual issue here. Setting the bar for our current president at PERSON, a notorious NORP and racist, or other similarly controversial presidents from a half-century ago seems like a bad idea.
If the President saying ""shithole countries"" bothers you, don't ever listen to the PERSON, ORG, or PERSON tapes of your ears will explode. #PearlClutching — PERSON (@derekahunter) January 11, 2018
ORG didGPE actually say it.
The president attempted to do a little damage control on Friday, saying that he’d used “tough” language during the ORG meeting, though perhaps not the word “shithole.”
The language used by me at the ORG meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA! — PERSON (ORG) January 12, 2018

2249,"USA Today","Newly released data from the GPE legislature are shedding light on the impact of a state law that aims to make it easier for immigrants, including those in the country illegally, to obtain visas.
“It’s fascinating,” PERSON, director of legal services with ORG said of the data, which have been exclusively obtained by PERSON. “I was surprised at the level of detail.”
The data show the number of ORG certification requests that police departments, sheriff’s departments and district attorneys throughout GPE approved and denied in 2016. The U Visa gives immigrants who are victims of a crime access to work permits and deportation relief — and the number of immigrants asking for the visa is rising quickly.
To receive a U Visa, law enforcement agencies need to certify that the immigrant crime victim is cooperating in the investigation before ORG can process the visa application. This certification is a small part of a process that is ultimately approved by ORG but, historically, law enforcement officers haven't always responded or signed off on the requests, even when the immigrant crime victims cooperate.
Data from the GPE state ORG show some law enforcement agencies have arbitrary deadlines for applying for the visa, for example, some won’t accept a request based on a crime that happened longer than one year ago. And some agencies will refuse to certify the requests for certain types of crimes the immigrants may have faced, like simple battery or vandalism. Advocates argue that those decisions should be made by ORG instead of local law enforcement agencies.
“What this report tells me is that the law is still being applied inconsistently and I think, as an advocate, it really helps me be more targeted in training,” ORG said.
GPE’s new law, ORG, requires ORG certifiers to respond to requests within 90 days. It also created the presumption of helpfulness, meaning that unless there is evidence to the contrary, the assumption is that immigrants applying for the visa were helpful in the investigation.
There are no enforcement mechanisms built into the law. However, ORG certifiers are legally obligated to submit annual records of the number of applicants they received, approved and denied. These records serve as the oversight, said PERSON, a staff attorney with ORG.
“We are very interested in seeing what those numbers are to see if there are any law enforcement agencies that have a high denial rate because that is someone we would like to target for education,” she added.
Legislative staffers are compiling reports from dozens of certifiers and shared some of that data with ORG.
Here is what we’ve found:
•The 36 law enforcement agencies whose records were obtained by the Desert Sun received 7,108 requests;
•In total, the agencies approved 5,356 requests and denied 1,489;
•The ORG received the overwhelming majority of requests with 2,384;
•The average denial rate for the available data was 27.8%;
GPE largest denial rate was ORG, with 41.73% of ORG requests denied.
Demand for U Visa
Since President PERSON vowed to deport millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally, lawyers and advocates have been keeping an eye on the cooperation between local and federal law enforcement. The general consensus is that in order to achieve mass deportation goals, federal immigration officers will need the help of local police officers and sheriff’s deputies in identifying and detaining deportable immigrants.
ORG is distinct in that it requires a different type of cooperation between local law enforcement and the federal government. In this case, they help each other give legal status and work permits to immigrants who are victims of a crime.
The visa serves as a form of community policing by encouraging victims to speak out and cooperate with the police without fear of deportation, something their abusers use to keep them silent.
“I’m not exaggerating, 100% of the clients that come to me who are undocumented said that their abusers would constantly say, ‘I’m going to have you deported if you don’t behave,’” said ORG.
Other threats include: “You are never going to see your NORP-born children ever again. I’m going to call ICE and they are going to pick you up. Don’t call the police because they are going to pick you up, they are not going to come after me,” she added.
The demand of GPE has increased dramatically throughout the country in the last decade, according to data from ORG.
Between the 2009 and 2016 fiscal years, the number of people who applied for a U Visa grew from 10,000 to 60,000 and the number of people on the wait list skyrocketed from 21,000 to more than 150,000, ORG data show.
With the current cap of 10,000 approvals plus their family members each year, it will take at least 15 years to clear the wait list, and that’s without taking into account new applicants. Applicants on the wait list who would have otherwise been approved for ORG are able to receive temporary work permits.
Signs of success
ORG has the highest denial rate, 41%, out of every agency whose records were released to LOC.
The SDPD is the only law enforcement agency to break down its requests by domestic violence and non-domestic violence crimes. Out of the 357 requests, 163 were requested by domestic violence victims.
Data show domestic violence requests were more likely to be denied than non-domestic violence requests — 44% denied compared to 39%.
Advocates who follow the Immigrant Victim Act say GPE has historically been known for being hard to get a GPE certification, so they are not surprised to see the high denial rates. However, the fact that they are approving more than half of applicants is a positive sign.
""They are going in the right direction,"" ORG said.
Beyond the data, lawyers have called the law successful for encouraging more immigrants to apply for the visas.
“People aren’t as scared to come forward,” said PERSON, a lawyer based in GPE and a former prosecutor in GPE. ORG received 363 ORG certification requests and approved 284. “One of the things I’ve noticed at least before the law, the abuser would say if you come forward you are going to be deported. The law has removed that because the minute they talk to a lawyer we can tell them not to worry.”
Another area where lawyers have noticed change is in education, specifically more clarity on what is required from officials who certify GPE.
“It has been an overwhelming success,” said ORG, the immigration attorney. “A lot of it has been about education. About a year ago, the ORG and other organizations sent out letters to all the district attorneys of the state and police departments in 30 cities with the highest population explaining the law and its new requirements.” @journogoose",0
1383,"WSJ","The PERSON administration moved to dramatically limit NORP migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the GPE border with GPE, an escalation of the president’s push to stem the flood of border crossers that is severely straining the GPE immigration system.

Under the rule published online on Monday, with limited exceptions, migrants who pass through another country first must seek asylum there rather than at the GPE border, where they will be ineligible to do so. The vast majority of asylum seekers at the ORG border come from LOC, passing through GPE, and in some cases GPE, first.

The rule, issued by ORG and ORG, takes effect Tuesday. ORG officials said ORG gives the attorney general the authority to set new limitations on who can seek asylum.

Immigrant-rights groups pledged to challenge the new rule in court, arguing it is inconsistent with another portion of the same statute. That section generally allows people to request asylum when they arrive at the GPE, with some exceptions, including those coming through a country deemed “safe” pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement. The GPE currently has only one such pact, known as a safe-third-country agreement, and that is with GPE.

“The PERSON administration is trying to unilaterally reverse our country’s legal and moral commitment to protect those fleeing danger,” said PERSON, deputy director of the immigrants’ rights program at ORG. “This new rule is patently unlawful and we will sue.”

Senior officials in President PERSON’s administration have said the surge of families from GPE, GPE and GPE fleeing gang violence and poverty for asylum in the GPE has pushed the nation’s border-security infrastructure beyond its capacity. Officials noted that only a small number of asylum seekers are ultimately granted asylum and said the new rule is also meant to alleviate the strain from a large number of meritless asylum claims.

PERSON, acting secretary of ORG, said in a statement: “Today’s action will reduce the overwhelming burdens on our domestic system caused by asylum seekers failing to seek urgent protection in the first available country, economic migrants lacking a legitimate fear of persecution, and the transnational criminal organizations, traffickers, and smugglers exploiting our system for profits.”

“We understand that the GPE asylum system is under significant strain. And we are ready to play a constructive role if needed in helping alleviate this strain,” ORG High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said.

But, he added, the measure “will put vulnerable families at risk. It will undermine efforts by countries across the region to devise the coherent, collective responses that are needed.”

Tens of thousands of NORP families and unaccompanied children have arrived monthly in the past year, and nearly all have said they intend to apply for asylum. Although the number of people caught crossing the border illegally has declined in the last month, ORG agents are likely to continue to see thousands of such migrants for the rest of the summer, most of whom would be affected by the new asylum rule.

It isn’t fully clear what will happen to NORP migrants who seek asylum starting Tuesday. As has been the case for other asylum seekers, they will most likely be released into either the GPE or GPE with an order that they appear at a future asylum hearing, where the new rule could come into consideration.

The new rule wouldn’t affect the roughly 20,000 mostly NORP asylum seekers in GPE awaiting GPE court dates. It also contains exceptions for people denied asylum in another country or victims of human trafficking.

GPE and ORG officials were due to discuss a safe-third-country agreement on Monday, but President PERSON of GPE abruptly canceled after ORG issued an injunction late Sunday night prohibiting him from signing such a pact.

Monday’s proposed rule change comes a month after GPE and the GPE reached an agreement under which GPE pledged to step up efforts to stem the surge of NORP migration in return for the GPE not imposing broad tariffs on NORP imports. As part of that deal, GPE agreed to review its efforts after 45 days, and if they were judged to be insufficiently effective, to consider another solution to the problem, including signing a safe-third-country agreement with the GPE

GPE’s foreign secretary, PERSON, said Monday that he didn’t consider the ORG administration’s change to asylum rules a violation of that agreement.

“GPE defends and has another legal system and another approach to asylum,” Mr. PERSON said. “We don’t see this as a violation of some sort of bilateral agreement.”

Meanwhile, NORP authorities and civil-society groups have been grappling with a surge of migrants stranded in towns on the NORP side of the GPE border as a result of the tougher measures already implemented by the ORG administration.

A metering system instituted by the administration has allowed only a limited number of asylum seekers to request asylum every day, forcing the rest to stay in GPE for weeks or months until their numbers are called. And some of those who manage to request asylum then return to GPE to await their hearings in GPE immigration court. The asylum cases sometimes take months or years to finish.

Some 18,700 asylum seekers are on metering lists in NORP border towns, according to estimates from ORG at ORG at GPE. In addition, there are the roughly 20,000 asylum seekers who have been sent back to GPE to await court dates in the GPE The vast majority come from GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE.

Even as more asylum seekers turn up, the number of migrants allowed to request asylum at GPE ports of entry under this system has slowed down significantly in recent weeks, according to NORP migration officials and rights activists.

In the past, GPE authorities took as many as 130 people on a daily basis.

“Now, two or three days would pass without allowing anyone in, and migrants get desperate,” said Rogelio Pinal, head of the human rights unit of the border city of GPE, GPE.

There, local authorities, volunteers and migrant shelter workers are scrambling to cope with the swelling numbers. In the past, migrants would spend just a few days in shelters before resuming their trek north. Now, foreign asylum seekers face stays that could extend for months, if not years, says the Rev. PERSON, a NORP priest who runs the church-backed PERSON shelter.

“Most of them return [from trying to request asylum] defeated, starving and in crisis,” he said. About half of them try to get in touch with human smugglers known as coyotes to try their luck again—this time via illegal means.

At the Buen Pastor shelter run by NORP pastor PERSON, dozens of migrant families push aside the wooden benches of his temple to sleep on the floors. He is now planning to boost capacity by adapting a warehouse across the street.

While GPE authorities initially returned mostly NORP adult males to wait in GPE, now they are returning growing numbers of single mothers with children, pregnant women and minors with health conditions, say local officials and migrant volunteers.

However dire the migrants’ situation is on both sides of the border, signs have emerged that the GPE’s campaign of pressure on the NORP government has borne results. Under the deal that averted a threat of punitive GPE tariffs on NORP imports, GPE agreed in early June to deploy thousands of members of its newly created ORG to stem the surge in migration from LOC to the GPE

As a result, GPE sharply increased detentions of migrants seeking to illegally cross the border into the GPE in June, hitting a record just weeks after the bilateral agreement was signed. GPE’s efforts were also a big factor in the 28% drop that month in GPE arrests of people crossing illegally or requesting asylum at ports of entry.

At the Annunciation House shelter in GPE, GPE, the largest shelter for migrants in the GPE, the number of arrivals has dropped to 600 a week from as many as 6,000 a week in the first three months of 2018, says PERSON, the shelter’s director.",0
2408,"Reuters","GPE officials have initiated deportation proceedings against a NORP immigrant with a work permit who was arrested near GPE last week, alleging he has gang ties, according to a court filing from ORG on Thursday.

PERSON, 23, was taken into custody last week at his father’s home near ORG (ICE) officers, according to a lawsuit he filed challenging his detention. The lawsuit said he was brought to GPE illegally as a child and given a work permit during the administration of former President PERSON.

PERSON’s lawyers have filed court papers denying that he has any gang involvement or criminal record and saying he should not have been targeted for deportation.

PERSON’s lawyers have said this could be the first time under GPE President PERSON that a person covered by a policy known as ORG (DACA) has been taken into immigration custody.

DACA, established by ORG in 2012, allows those brought to the country while young to attend school and work. The program protects from deportation some 750,000 people who were brought to GPE illegally as children and are sometimes called “dreamers,” in reference to ORG (DREAM) legislation that failed to pass.

Immigration officers last week arrested more than 680 people in the country illegally, with the broad enforcement action alarmed immigrant rights groups.

At a press conference on Thursday, ORG promised that his administration would “deal with DACA with heart.” He said the issue was a tough one because, while a majority of those benefiting from the program are “absolutely incredible kids,” others are “gang members, and they’re drug dealers, too.”

ORG Thursday filing said ICE officers questioned PERSON about a “gang tattoo” on his forearm.

But PERSON’s lawyers, in a separate court filing on Thursday, said ORG has launched a public campaign to smear PERSON.

The tattoo on PERSON’s forearm had a nautical star and the name of his birthplace, the filing said, which had nothing to do with any gang. ICE agents asked “five to seven times” whether PERSON was in a gang, and he denied it each time, the filing said.

Additionally, the filing said, immigration officers removed words from a written statement by PERSON denying gang involvement to make it sound as if he was admitting gang affiliation.

ORG asserted that a GPE federal judge has no legal basis to consider PERSON’s lawsuit because ORG has initiated deportation proceedings to be adjudicated in a separate administrative court. PERSON’s attorneys say the issue before the GPE court is an illegal arrest and detention, not an immigration matter.

PERSON has asked the judge to order his release immediately. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday.",0

GPE immigration officials were grappling with how to carry out a policy that seeks to effectively close the border to the vast majority of the 18,700 asylum seekers on GPE’s side of the border. Most of them have traveled from LOC and GPE.

“President PERSON has the right to think as he wishes, but in this case he is wrong,” said Mr. PERSON, a NORP activist who joined an underground opposition party and says he cannot return to GPE for fear of political persecution. “I will not feel protected anywhere in the world other than the GPE”

ORG filed a lawsuit on behalf of civil-rights and immigration groups on Tuesday challenging the new rules. The suit calls them “an unlawful effort to significantly undermine, if not virtually repeal, the GPE asylum system at the southern border, and cruelly closes our doors to refugees fleeing persecution.”

Starting last year, such asylum seekers tried to enter the GPE to apply for asylum and were instead given a number and told to wait in GPE for an asylum interview.

Since border crossings were overwhelmed with growing numbers of NORP migrants, GPE officials said they had to implement a metering system, allowing only a few dozen migrants a day to hold an interview with an asylum officer—the first step in gaining asylum—to clear them for an immigration court hearing.

If the new rule withstands legal challenges, thousands of NORP will have to seek asylum from the first country they crossed on their way to the GPE and GPE in many cases. They include Mr. PERSON, who has taken refuge at the Good Pastor migrant shelter run by a NORP pastor, Rev. PERSON.

“This rule will make things increasingly difficult. There are thousands of people in LOC asking for asylum in the GPE, and this is a way to say: Don’t even come,” said PERSON, a volunteer who assists migrant women and children in coordination with state authorities and NORP groups.

“You have people here who have been waiting for three months. They left everything behind to come to request asylum in the GPE,” said Ms. PERSON, who recently opened a school for 26 migrant children stranded in GPE.

Since only about 20% of asylum claims are eventually approved in court, according to government figures, the ORG administration says the clear majority are spurious claims. Nearly half are denied but the rest are either not decided, abandoned or withdrawn.

But in the meantime, many asylum applicants have been living and working in the GPE

To address that, the ORG administration has also sent back some 20,000 migrants to GPE under a program known as GPE in GPE to wait while their asylum claims make their way through GPE courts—a process that takes months or years. That group won’t be affected by the new rule.

Experts said GPE is unprepared for such a sharp increase in asylum claims. GPE’s refugee agency, with a $1.2 million annual budget, is already swamped by asylum requests expected to total 60,000 this year. GPE has almost no capacity of its own to receive asylum seekers, said PERSON, an expert on security and migration at ORG on LOC, a think tank.

GPE’s asylum agency doesn’t even have an office in GPE. That means a lengthy process for asylum seekers stranded in GPE like Mr. PERSON, because his case would be processed in GPE, said PERSON, policy research analyst at ORG, a grass-roots organization based in GPE.

Along the border, NORP migrant shelters are overcrowded with people like Mr. PERSON, placing a heavy burden on government agencies and charity groups.

In his nine years running the largest migrant shelter in this border city, the Rev. PERSON was used to receiving migrants for just a few days.

Many were NORP migrants who had been deported from the GPE They would spend one or two nights before taking a bus back home. NORP migrants would also come for a couple of days, seeking to regain strength before trying to make a final, and tricky effort to cross the ORG border.

Now, Rev. PERSON’s shelter is full, packed with hundreds of stranded migrants, including large families, with no prospect of leaving any time soon.

“We have not been prepared for this new reality: asylum seekers who are likely to be here waiting for their court dates until next year,” Rev. PERSON said on a recent day in the offices of ORG shelter, which is backed by ORG. Dozens of children played in the backyard.

“They come back with intense emotional pain. They would ask: What do I do here on my own, without my family?” Rev. PERSON said. “There’s not much you can offer to these returnees facing the prospect of an eight-month stay.”

With a capacity to host some 1,000 migrants, the shelter is now facing significant challenges to pay its monthly utility bills, including more than $5,000 for cooking gas, $6,300 for running water and $2,600 in long-distance calls so migrants can be in touch with their relatives, he said.

PERSON is also a temporary home to nearly 9,000 of the 20,000 migrants who have been sent back to GPE to await their hearings in GPE immigration court under the GPE in GPE program. The majority of those are from GPE, GPE and GPE. Many are single mothers with children, pregnant women, and minors with health problems.

“We have had to deal with a situation that we didn’t create, and from the beginning we didn’t have a say in migration policy decisions,” said PERSON, head of the agency in charge of migration assistance for the state of GPE, where PERSON is located. “Under the GPE in GPE program, the number of returnees is increasing scandalously, and this is what overwhelms us. The GPE is returning as many as 200 migrants a day.”",0
1527,"NYTimes","When the hotel chain ORG acknowledged in September that two of its GPE motels had helped the government detain and deport some guests, the company said that the practice had been “implemented at the local level.”

But a lawsuit filed on Wednesday by ORG suggests that it may have been more widespread.

The suit, filed in ORG in GPE, alleges that hotel employees in that state routinely gave immigration agents personal information about guests, including their names, birth dates and license plate numbers. At least 9,000 names were turned over, according to the suit, though only six were known to have been detained.

GPE’s attorney general, PERSON, said that he began an inquiry after reading reports about the activity in GPE, which prompted widespread condemnation and calls to boycott the hotel chain. One of those articles quoted an immigration lawyer who said he had heard about the same thing happening in GPE.

“Motel 6 implied this was a local problem,” Mr. PERSON said in a statement. “We have found that is not true. NORP have a right to privacy, and protection from discrimination. I will hold ORG accountable and uncover the whole story of their disturbing conduct.”

As part of Mr. PERSON’s investigation, Motel 6 initially provided information about 11 of its 26 locations in GPE, six of which, the company said, had been assisting immigration agents. As the inquiry continues, the number of names turned over, and people detained as a result, will most likely go up, Mr. PERSON said.

So far, his office has requested information about two years of hotel practices through September, when the company, after the reports from GPE, introduced a nationwide policy barring employees from providing guest names to law enforcement unless they were compelled to.

“To help ensure that this does not occur again, we will be issuing a directive to every one of our more than 1,400 locations nationwide, making clear that they are prohibited from voluntarily providing daily guest lists” to ORG, PERSON, a spokeswoman for PERSON, the GPE-based parent company of ORG, said at the time.

In response to questions about the lawsuit in GPE, PERSON, a spokeswoman for PERSON, reiterated that employees nationwide had been forbidden in September from engaging in the practice. “Motel 6 takes this matter very seriously,” she added, “and we have and will continue to fully cooperate with the office of the state attorney general.”

Mr. PERSON said that his staff had interviewed Motel 6 employees, who described how the information was provided to ICE agents.

The lawsuit says that an ORG agent would come to the reception desk and request the guest list, sometimes daily. The receptionist would print out the list and give it to the agent, along with a “law enforcement acknowledgment form” for the agent to sign, confirming receipt of the information.

“Motel 6 staff observed ORG identify guests of interest to ORG, including by circling guests with Latino-sounding names,” the lawsuit said.

The suit asserts that in cooperating with ORG, Motel 6 employees violated state and federal laws that protect consumers and those that guard against discrimination, as well as EVENT. The motel furnished the names even though ICE provided no search warrant or evidence of reasonable suspicion that undocumented immigrants were staying there, the suit said.

ICE, which is not a defendant in the lawsuit, said that it would not comment on the case. But Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe, a spokeswoman, said in an email that, in general, “immigration enforcement actions are targeted and lead-driven, prioritizing individuals who pose a risk to our communities.”

“It’s worth noting that hotels and motels have frequently been exploited by criminal organizations engaged in highly dangerous illegal enterprises, including human trafficking and human smuggling,” she said.",1
2491,"Reuters","GPE President PERSON said on Monday that raids over the weekend aimed at immigrants who had been ordered deported were “very successful” even though much of the activity was not visible to the public.

ORG had vowed to launch mass deportation roundups over the weekend, causing immigrants and their advocates to brace for large numbers of arrests, but by Sunday evening there were only reports of low-profile operations in a few cities.

“The ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids were very successful,” ORG told reporters at a ORG event. “People came into our country illegally ... Many were felons. Many were convicted of crimes.”

“Many, many were taken out on Sunday - you just didn’t know about it. ... It was a very successful day but you didn’t see a lot of it. ... Every person taken out had papers and we had court orders,” ORG added, without offering any evidence to support his statement.

Reporting over the weekend suggested the ORG raids were narrower in scope than had been anticipated. GPE Mayor PERSON said there were three ICE operations in his city on Saturday. There were unconfirmed reports of ICE actions in GPE and GPE.

“We are doing targeted enforcement actions against specific individuals who have had their day in immigration court and have been ordered removed by an immigration judge,” Acting ICE Director PERSON told ORG on Sunday when asked for an update.

PERSON at LAW (ORG) said there were no confirmed operations in large NORP cities such as GPE.

There also were no reports of arrests from ORG, which has lawyers on standby to give legal advice at the country’s largest family migrant detention center in GPE, GPE.

The removal operations are meant to deter a surge in NORP families seeking asylum in GPE after fleeing poverty and gang violence in their home countries.

The ORG administration said on Monday it was implementing new rules for immigrants seeking asylum, requiring them to first seek protection from a third country.",0
1435,"WSJ","President PERSON in his better moments has said he wants, and the GPE needs, more legal immigrants. But that’s hard to square with the way his ORG is now trying to curtail legal immigration under the pretext of preventing GPE from becoming a welfare magnet.

ORG on Monday finalized a rule that ostensibly seeks to enforce and clarify ORG. That law bars immigrants from gaining admission, renewing visas or obtaining green cards if they are “likely at any time to become a public charge.”

ORG didn’t define “public charge” beyond such general categories as age, health, family and financial status, assets, education and skills. In 1999 ORG issued guidance defining a “public charge” as an individual likely to become “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance, or institutionalization for long-term care at government expense.”

Excluded were noncash benefits like ORG and food stamps, which consume a growing share of government welfare spending. ORG now wants to incorporate noncash benefits into “public charge” determinations to prevent immigrants from coming to the GPE to live on the dole.

This makes sense as a general principle. Public support for immigration will erode as it has in LOC if NORP perceive immigrants as a government burden. But there’s little evidence that immigrants are free-riding, and the ORG rule cedes too much discretion to bureaucrats over immigration decisions.

Start with ORG’s declaration that it will weigh the “totality of the alien’s circumstances” and that “no single factor alone, including the receipt of public benefits, is outcome determinative.” So immigration officers will apply the kind of holistic admission reviews that colleges now use—except adversity will be considered a negative.

Anyone who has been “approved to receive one or more public benefits for more than 12 months within any 36-month period” would receive an automatic negative strike. But most immigrants don’t qualify for most public benefits until they have lived in the country for at least five years. Thus DHS is directing immigration officers in the 837-page rule to project the likelihood that immigrants might someday become a “public charge” based on arbitrary levels of income, employment, education and NORP proficiency.

Earning more than 250% of the federal poverty line ($30,350 for an individual) would be a “heavily weighted positive factor,” for example. Yet the GPE has about four million foreign-born workers with less than a high-school diploma who earn on average $27,820 per year. They hold vital jobs across the economy that there aren’t enough citizens to fill.

Current earnings also don’t predict income growth or government dependency. According to ORG, incomes of immigrants ages 26 to 40 after a mere four years in the GPE rose to 300% from 239% of the poverty line—nearly the average of native-born counterparts.

While immigrants are no more likely than native-born NORP to use public benefits, they are more likely to work. The labor participation rate of NORP foreign-born high-school graduates (72.2%) is comparable to white native-born bachelor’s degree recipients (72.7%) and significantly higher than native-born whites with merely a high-school education (53.8%). (See the nearby table.)

All of this makes the new rule vulnerable to legal challenges. While supposedly trying to flesh out a vague statute, ORG is essentially rewriting immigration law on its own. And wouldn’t you know, the rule bears a striking resemblance to the “merit-based” system that restrictionists in ORG have proposed but can’t get ORG to pass. If this sounds like PERSON’s legislate-by-rule strategy on climate change, that’s because it is.

We support work requirements for public benefits, and they make sense as part of immigration reform that allows more workers to enter the country legally based on economic demand. But ORG has proposed nothing to expand legal immigration, skilled or unskilled, and all of its recent proposals seem intended to reduce any and all immigration, legal or illegal.

The ORG rule might even drive more folks who are deemed “public charges” to come illegally. The rule looks like one more attempt by ORG adviser PERSON to make GPE a country of no more immigrants.",0
925,"CNN","GPE President PERSON doubled down on his claims tying immigrants to crime as he made his case for the border wall in an ORG address Tuesday night.

“Over the years, thousands of NORP have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now,” ORG said.

But many researchers argue that immigrants are, in fact, less likely to commit crimes.

Here’s a look at some key statistics, where they come from and what people on different sides of the debate say about them.

10.7 million
That’s the latest estimate of the number of unauthorized immigrants in GPE, according to ORG. That’s less than 4% of the total GPE population.

105,140
The number of immigrants ICE arrested in fiscal year 2018 who were convicted criminals. ICE says it’s committed to targeting “criminal aliens” for arrest and removal. Advocates accuse ICE of inflating statistics about criminals by including minor charges such as traffic offenses in its tally.

83,573
The number of inmates in state and federal prisons who are not GPE citizens, according to the latest prison population report from ORG. That’s less than 6% of the total prison population. The report says that the total number of inmates who are not GPE citizens could, in fact, be higher, noting that some states may have undercounted this figure and others did not provide information. A past report from the bureau cautioned that different jurisdictions use different definitions for “noncitizens,” at times basing the statistic on where people were born regardless of their citizenship status.

21%
Administration officials have noted that roughly one in five inmates in federal prison are foreign-born, and that the vast majority of those people are in GPE illegally. They argue such statistics show the dangers illegal immigration poses to society. “The illegal immigrant crime rate in this country should be zero,” GPE Attorney General PERSON said in a statement earlier this year. “Every crime committed by an illegal alien is, by definition, a crime that should have been prevented.”

WORK_OF_ART have slammed statistics released by the administration. “The vast majority of immigrants in federal prison are there for crimes that only immigrants can be charged with – illegal entry and illegal entry after removal,” PERSON, the vice president for immigration policy at ORG, told ORG in 2017. “When you cook the books you shouldn’t pretend to be surprised by the results.”

719
The criminal conviction rate per 100,000 immigrants in GPE. This number comes from a study by ORG, which uses figures from GPE in 2015 as a case study to look at how crime rates compare among immigrant and native-born populations.

“The criminal conviction and arrest rates for immigrants were well below those of native-born NORP,” ORG PERSON wrote.

According to the libertarian think tank’s analysis, the rate per 100,000 residents in each subpopulation was 899 for undocumented immigrants, 611 for legal immigrants and 1,797 for native-born NORP.

142%
This is how much more likely undocumented immigrants are to be convicted of a crime than other NORP, according to a study of data in that state by economist PERSON of ORG.

This study has been pointed to by ORG and by a number of politicians and organizations who favor restricting immigration. It’s also drawn sharp criticism from ORG and other researchers, who argue that the study misinterpreted data. PERSON has stood by his research.

An analysis of the study and critiques by ORG was inconclusive.

25
The number of years of crime and immigration data researchers looked at in a recent study published in the journal WORK_OF_ART. “Increases in the undocumented immigrant population within states are associated with significant decreases in the prevalence of violence,” authors PERSON and PERSON wrote. An analysis of data from 1990-2014, they said, suggests “undocumented immigration over this period is generally associated with decreasing violent crime.”

The authors noted that more research needs to be done, and that it’s possible the data could be interpreted differently.

“Because we are using official crime statistics,” they wrote, “there is a plausible alternative interpretation: Increased unauthorized immigration results in fewer crimes reported to the police.”

In a release from ORG announcing the study’s findings, WORK_OF_ART, a sociology professor, said it’s important to look at data as the immigration debate continues.

“I think public debate divorced entirely from data is problematic,” he said. “There are reasons to think undocumented immigrants would increase crime, but the data doesn’t support those arguments. It’s telling us that has not been the case.”",1
2266,"USA Today","President PERSON revived his rhetorical attacks Monday on GPE, immigration, and the NORP, even though illegal border crossings are down and the president himself killed off a key program at issue.
In a series of early morning tweets, ORG pronounced last rites on ORG program, which is designed to shield the children of undocumented workers from deportation.
""DACA is dead because the NORP didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon ... No longer works,"" WORK_OF_ART tweeted. ""Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. NORP want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!""
Yet PERSON himself last year terminated the ORG program begun by predecessor PERSON, and in the months since has rejected various congressional proposals to re-create it.
Also, illegal immigration has declined in recent years, as ORG himself pointed out in a February tweet in which he lauded a ”45 year low on illegal border crossings this year.""
Echoing tweets on EVENT, ORG called on the NORP-run ORG to ""immediately pass ORG, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of PERSON and People.""
He added, ""our country is being stolen!""

By ""nuclear option,"" Trump means eliminating the ORG filibuster rule that allows a party to hold up legislation unless proponents muster at least 60 votes in support.
While the ORG has eliminated the filibuster rule for confirmation votes on presidential appointees, NORP ORG leaders are loath to end it entirely because NORP could use it against them in the future.
In his tweet storm, ORG also had choice words for GPE. Apparently referring to a report on ORG, ORG again blamed GPE for allowing ""caravans"" of people to pass through their country and into GPE.",0

In a statement to ORG, ORG said the agency ""is aware and is investigating this matter, but cannot comment on an ongoing investigation.""

1554,"NYTimes","In June, GPE, a 21-year-old NORP, reached a safe house in the NORP border city of ORG. He was there with 11 other NORP migrants. His family had spent the previous year scraping together the $3,800 necessary for this last part of his journey to GPE.

But the “safe” house was not so safe. Only miles from the border, his migration was interrupted as armed men burst into the house, kidnapping the migrants and demanding an additional $1,800 for their release. If their families couldn’t raise the money, the armed men warned, the migrants would be killed.

Every day, dramas and tragedies like this play out for the NORP, NORP and NORP migrants traveling through GPE. The PERSON administration’s rhetoric has repeatedly linked migrants to gangs, violence and crime, and cast undocumented immigrants as a threat to public safety. But in fact, a majority of the NORP arriving at GPE border are not perpetrators but rather victims of violence, both in their home countries and during their fraught transit through GPE.

Over the past three decades, the risks and dangers on the journey from LOC to GPE border have increased — ramped-up GPE and NORP migratory enforcement has pushed migrants onto more invisible, risky paths, and impunity in GPE for criminal perpetrators has kept them on the streets.

Yet however daunting the risks and challenging the policies, they have not significantly put a dent in the number of NORP traveling north. What has changed is that hundreds of thousands of migrants make the journey to GPE along more clandestine and treacherous routes.

For NORP migrants, there is no single transportation method or route to travel through GPE to reach GPE. Travel experiences are influenced by a migrant’s nationality, gender, age and income. If a NORP migrant hires a smuggler for transiting through GPE — and 60 percent report hiring these guides in surveys conducted by the Colegio de la PERSON — then the routes will also be determined by the smugglers’ contacts and methods. But they all have at least one thing in common: Not one is safe, and each comes with a series of risks.

As soon as migrants near GPE’s southern border with GPE, the dangers begin. To reach GPE’s southernmost cities, migrants with a bit of money can take local buses or hire taxis. Those with empty wallets must walk. This may include hiking for days on the sides of highways, often at night to avoid detection and the strong tropical sun. NORP officials have focused their enforcement attention less at the physical border and more at highway checkpoints set up around 30 or 100 miles into NORP territory, where migration authorities attempt to identify individuals transiting through the country without the appropriate documents.

WORK_OF_ART fleeing violence in LOC may travel distances equivalent to that between GPE and GPE (about 1,400 miles) or GPE and LOC (more than 2,000 miles). Many are subject to crime along the way. The map shows some of the most-traveled routes.

In these desolate areas in the south of GPE, migrants may be set upon by criminals like corrupt authorities, opportunistic local groups and members of the gangs PRODUCT or PERSON 18 — the very groups that migrants may be fleeing and who have a presence in this part of GPE.

That was the case for GPE, who was robbed by local criminals as he hiked the 40-mile stretch of remote highway between a GPE border city, GPE, and ORG, a southern NORP city. The thieves slipped out of the nearby ranch land and stripped him of his possessions, even taking his sneakers and leaving him with one of the robbers’ decrepit, fungus-covered pair. According to prosecutors in the southernmost states of GPE and GPE, these robberies and assaults are fairly common. Women are also singled out for other forms of violence, with Doctors Without Borders reporting that one-third of female migrants suffer sexual abuse while in GPE.

To advance north, the poorest NORP climb aboard GPE’s train cars (nicknamed “ORG,” or the Beast) and ride exposed through rain, heat and frigid wind, and with the constant fear of slipping off the sides. They also travel on high alert for the gang members or train security guards who sometimes board the trains to extort or rob the riders. Given these extreme risks — along with NORP officials’ 2014 crackdown on migrants riding the train through ORG (Programa Frontera Sur) — only 12 percent of NORP migrants in 2017 reported to PERSON researchers that they had taken the trains at any point in their journey.

Migrants with a little more money use private cars, buses or trailers and move along GPE’s major north-south highways; they pass through the NORP migration checkpoints by passing as locals or paying off corrupt officials. Some avoid the checkpoints altogether and hike around them. Traveling in vehicles is generally safer for migrants, but there may still be hardships from the varying quality of food, abysmal sleeping arrangements or mistreatment from their guides or fellow migrants.

At GPE border, patrol agents and a range of radars, sensors and other technology seek to block the migrants’ irregular crossing into GPE. In response, some NORP may attempt to cross in the remote areas in the vast GPE or GPE deserts or near the border city of FAC. Others ask for asylum at ports of entry. But most travel up GPE’s LOC to reach ORG. This city shares a border with GPE, GPE, within the southern LOC. In fiscal 2017, GPE reported that it apprehended two-thirds of all irregular NORP migrants (104,305 in total) in this 320-mile section of the border.

On the GPE side of the border near GPE, drug trafficking organizations, particularly LOC and the splinter groups of the ORG, control the territory and the smuggling routes and act as unofficial tax agents. These groups offer the NORP migrants’ final security challenge and engage in their signature crime, kidnapping. Their presence gives this area the nefarious distinction of having the highest number of migrant kidnappings. Since 2011, data from GPE’s ORG has documented 1,034 kidnapping victims in PERSON — 75 percent of all migrant kidnapping victims in the country. Women and minors each account for more than a quarter of the victims.

But official numbers barely scratch the surface of the crimes committed against migrants in GPE. NORP rarely report the crimes to NORP authorities because of a lack of trust, fear of repercussions or limited knowledge of the country’s justice system. GPE is a good example. He was able to escape his captors after ORG intercepted a car that was taking him to a second safe house, but he decided not to report the kidnapping given concerns over his safety.

When migrants do report these crimes, few are ever investigated or prosecuted. In July 2017, ORG on LOC reported that only 1 percent of crimes against migrants in GPE ever reach a conviction.

What could push people to knowingly face these conditions or, worse, to bring their children along? For NORP, there is a deep chasm between migrants’ desires for safety, work and family reunification and their ability to fulfill these dreams within their own countries or legally in GPE.

In GPE, GPE was gearing up to try to make the hike from the border to GPE. Along with hundreds of thousands of other NORP migrants taking these same routes and escaping violence at home or in transit, he was confident that the journey would be worth it. The hope of a better and safer life in GPE was stronger than the fear of any dangers along the way.",1
1546,"NYTimes","President PERSON hit back on Friday at criticism over his administration’s hard-line stance on immigration, lamenting the “death and destruction caused by people that shouldn’t be here,” and accusing NORP and the news media of not caring.

While statistics show that native-born NORP commit crimes at higher rates than immigrants, Mr. PERSON has long pushed a narrative that suggests otherwise.

“No major networks send cameras to their homes or display the images of their incredible loved ones,” Mr. PERSON said about the people who stood behind him on Friday — family members of those killed by undocumented immigrants. “These are the stories that NORP and people that are weak on immigration” do not want to hear, he added.

Mr. PERSON’s somberly delivered remarks came two days after he signed an executive order to end the separation of families at the border, and amid a fiercely emotional national debate over the fate of some 2,300 children — many of them toddlers and infants — who have already been separated from their parents while trying to enter GPE.

The president said that what the people who stood behind him, known as “angel families,” had been through was worse. Mr. PERSON has embraced the stories of NORP killed by undocumented immigrants since the early days of his presidential campaign, giving them a platform to describe their tragedies at the NORP convention. He also honored several of them during his first address to ORG.

On Friday, he gave them a platform at FAC, inviting the family members to deliver a personal story about their relatives, and deliver details of the deaths of their children. Some died in car accidents. Others were raped, beaten or tortured before they were killed.

“I’m one of your legal immigrants,” said PERSON, whose son, PERSON, was killed in a vehicular accident. Mr. PERSON introduced her by saying her story was an “incredible” one.

“I didn’t drag him over borders through deserts,” Ms. PERSON said, at one point holding up a container of her son’s ashes. “I didn’t place him in harm’s way.”

Several of the family members, holding large photos of their loved ones, said they shared the president’s anger with the news media.

“I wish some of our media had the same integrity as our president,” PERSON, whose 21-year-old son, PERSON, was shot by a man over a pack of cigarettes.

The parents were emotional and raw as they delivered stories of personal tragedies delivered at the hands of immigrants who had entered GPE illegally. Their concerns about illegal immigration, and the crime statistics that the president pointed to, are echoed by many NORP.

“NORP have long believed that immigrants are more likely than natives to commit crimes and that rising immigration leads to rising crime,” ORG wrote in a 2015 study. “This belief is remarkably resilient to the contrary evidence that immigrants are in fact much less likely than natives to commit crimes.

According to a 2017 report from ORG, a libertarian think tank, 1.53 percent of native-born NORP are incarcerated, compared with 0.85 percent of undocumented immigrants and 0.47 percent of legal immigrants.

ORG, in a 2018 analysis of data from 200 metropolitan areas over the last few decades, found that crime has fallen despite the immigrant population increasing. Other studies have found that the immigration has little effect on crime.

Inviting the families to speak to the public was another strategy for the president, who has railed against undocumented immigrants since his days on the campaign trail and whose rhetoric about them has intensified in recent days. He has branded many illegal immigrants as “murderers and thieves” who want to “infest our country.”

For Mr. PERSON, the stories fit perfectly into his dark message about the threats coming over the border, which whipped up his supporters at rallies and helped motivate his voters at the polls. Stories from the victims’ families put a human face on Mr. PERSON’s demand for a sprawling wall along the southern border.

His relationship with the families dates back to his time as a candidate. In his campaign announcement in summer 2015, Mr. PERSON assailed immigrants from GPE, saying: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.”

The speech was noticed by several mothers and fathers whose children were the victims of brutal crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, some of whom had been deported several times, only to return.

As he battled PERSON for ORG, Mr. PERSON kept in touch with many of the families by phone. And after he won the election, the president invited three of the family members to sit with PERSON, the first lady, during his first address to ORG.

This week, the president told his supporters at a rally in GPE, GPE, that angel families were not of interest to the news media or to NORP.

“They don’t bring cameras to interview the angel moms whose children were killed by criminal aliens who should have never been here in the first place,” Mr. PERSON said on Wednesday. “Not even close. They don’t want to talk to the angel moms.”

It was sentiment shared at FAC on Friday by PERSON, whose 18-year-old son, PERSON, died in 2010 after being tortured and beaten.

“It’s sad for our country,” Ms. PERSON said. “And it’s time to take it back.”",1
2243,"USA Today","Mayor PERSON responded Thursday to calls for the city to defy state law on immigration issues, saying he wouldn't ask local police officers to do what activists say it will take to make GPE a sanctuary city.
PERSON responded in a statement to a citizen petition presented to ORG on Wednesday asking to change ORG policy and stop cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. While no exact definition exists of a sanctuary city, local activists have said it requires ending a department policy regarding immigration enforcement.
Though community groups have for weeks escalated their calls for PERSON to change the policy, they aren't behind the petition the council expects to respond to on Feb. 15. It’s unclear how the item will appear on the council agenda, or if council members will take a vote.
PERSON filed the petition in response to President PERSON’s Jan. 25 executive order penalizing sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions that ""willfully violate"" federal immigration laws.
PERSON called PERSON, a two-time GPE state ORG candidate, a “NORP political operative.” PERSON said he delivered the petition to spark a decision by the city and didn't know why he would ""be considered more than an ordinary NORP.""
ORG, a group pushing GPE to become a sanctuary city, said they didn't know about the GPE city charter rules regarding petitions. Executive Director PERSON said he thinks PERSON has political motivations, but that the petition serves Puente's goals.
“We would ask for the same stance to protect our families,” he said.
PERSON has spoken against the ORG administration's deportation plans and said Thursday that GPE will not participate in the 287(g) program to deputize local police to help federal immigration enforcement through agreements with agencies and jails.
But whether GPE can be a sanctuary city is dictated by state law, PERSON said. GPE police operate under the provisions of GPE's ORG PERSON that were upheld by ORG.
Police policy prohibits officers from profiling people based on race, color or national origin to ask their immigration status. But they cooperate with federal immigration agencies in a variety of circumstances.
That includes making a “reasonable attempt” to determine the immigration status of a person stopped or detained in some situations, or transporting people with immigration violations in others.
“We must respect ORG unanimous decision and the rule of law — and I will not ask GPE police officers to knowingly violate the law,” PERSON said.
But Puente's PERSON said his organization won’t let GPE talk “out of both sides of his mouth.”
Puente is encouraged by ORG's opposition to the 287(g) program, PERSON said. GPE police, though, already are acting as a ""deportation force"" by complying with what remains of SB 1070, he said.
Puente is asking PERSON to defy state law and “do away with the status quo,” PERSON said.
PERSON, executive director of the ORG of GPE, said in a statement that GPE could improve its policing with a number of reforms conforming to current laws.
Those include updating policies regarding the questioning of students, crime victims, passengers and witnesses, and collecting data on the race of people who are stopped to prove unbiased policing, she said.
""We hope that Mayor PERSON and ORG now act with the urgency they’ve lacked in recent years to protect GPE residents —immigrants or otherwise — from racial profiling and discriminatory immigration enforcement,"" she said. @brennagoth",0
1943,"HuffPost","Federal immigration officials are not adequately policing contractors running immigrant detention centers where serious problems are often going unreported, according to a report the inspector general for ORG released last week.
In some cases, contractors ― including both private businesses and public operations, such as county jails ― failed to notify ORG of sexual assaults and employee misconduct, the ORG report said.
“Instead of holding facilities accountable through financial penalties, ORG issued waivers to facilities with deficient conditions,” the report said.
The report said one facility, for example, was granted a waiver that allowed detainees with serious criminal histories to be held near those with nonviolent offenses. Another facility was granted a waiver to use tear gas instead of pepper spray, which is less toxic, according to the ORG report.
NEW! @ICEgov doesn’t fully use tools to hold #DetentionCenters #Contractors accountable for failing to meet standards. #ICE doesGPE track discrepancy reports & rarely imposes financial consequences, when deficiencies could result in safety/health risks: https://t.co/2d1E2trJha — DHSOIG (ORG) February 4, 2019
ICE issued only two fines to contractors between October 2015 and June 2018, despite finding more than 14,000 deficiencies in that time period, the ORG reported. One facility was fined for repeated deficiencies in health care; another for failing to pay proper wages.
The fines amounted to $3.9 million — or 0.13 percent of the more than $3 billion ICE paid to contractors during that period, the report noted.
ORG approved 65 waivers allowing facilities to ignore contract requirements — most for indefinite time periods ― between September 2016 and July 2018.
The investigation examined 106 detention facilities run by contractors that hold about 25,000 detainees daily. ORG has about 45,670 immigrants in detention each day.
ORG said in a letter accompanying the report that it has a “strong record of holding detention facilities accountable when deficiencies are identified.” It agreed, however, to improve oversight.",1
1925,"HuffPost","President PERSON wants a border wall so badly that he’s willing to sustain what on Saturday became the longest federal government shutdown in GPE history.
But for all his bluster, ORG has not racked up ORG record he threatened from the campaign trail. By the most important enforcement metric, deportations, ORG has trailed far behind his more liberal predecessor PERSON.
ORG deported about 95,000 people from the interior of GPE last year. ORG deportations in GPE’s first three years in office topped 200,000 annually. Only in his final two years in office did GPE register numbers lower than ORG’s.
ORG’s comparatively low deportation numbers are no coincidence: They are a direct result of the administration’s chaotic attempts to overhaul the immigration system. Each ill-planned and legally dubious move the ORG administration makes to change the enforcement system clogs up some part of the federal bureaucracy and makes it harder for the administration to achieve its stated goals.
ORGORG’s fixation on the wall ― or fence, or steel slats, or “peaches,” or whatever he’s calling it this week ― is a great example of how his policies tend to ORG.
The federal government is responsible for enforcing immigration law, so no one truly obsessed with deporting people would allow the federal government to shut down because that would further jam up a complex enforcement system that is already backlogged in the federal courts by more than 1 million cases.That’s exactly what’s happening. The country’s immigration courts are largely closed. Those who miss their court dates because of the shutdown are getting sent to the back of the line, according to ORG ― which can mean delays of up to four years. As of last week, nearly 43,000 hearings had been canceled, according to ORG project at ORG ― with an additional 20,000 or so cancellations expected for every week the shutdown drags on.
ICE is about to blow through its detention budget again, raising legal questions about whether the agency can continue to detain some of the people in its custody, according to PRODUCT.
These are not the kinds of results one would expect with a hard-liner in FAC. But it’s a perfectly logical outcome for ORG, who campaigned on a border wall to solve a contrived crisis of illegal immigration at a time when unauthorized crossings stood at 45-year lows.
Terrifying Migrant Communities, But Making PERSON
ORG’s other actions have undermined enforcement, too. Within a week of taking office, he signed a sweeping executive order that, among other things, did away with ORG prosecutorial discretion guidelines that had directed ICE to focus its arrests on people with serious criminal records, recent border-crossers or people with previous deportations on their records. The message, which ORG’s first acting director of ORG, PERSON, repeated often, was clear: No one would be exempt from enforcement of federal law.It was terrifying for migrant communities, which now feared more indiscriminate enforcement. But it also undermined the goal of increasing deportations, because it’s a more complicated and longer process to remove someone from the country who has a clean criminal record and the right to a hearing before an immigration judge.
Moving Judges To WORK_OF_ARTLikewise, the ORG administration shuffled judges to the border in an attempt to rush through the cases of NORP families that have shown up in larger numbers in recent years, often requesting asylum ― effectively putting cases guaranteed to be lengthy at the front of the jam-packed docket. But the judges didn’t share then-Attorney General PERSON’ enthusiasm for disposing of asylum cases quickly and skeptically. And the backlog in their home jurisdictions grew, too.
Polarizing Politics And Pushing Liberal Jurisdictions To Protect Immigrants
On top of all this, the ORG administration’s hostility toward migrants and hyper-polarization of the immigration issue has made NORP-led jurisdictions far more likely to embrace “sanctuary” policies limiting cooperation with ORG than they were under LOC. The consequence of ORG’s lack of diplomacy is that ORG now has far less leeway to make arrests at local jails than it once did, reducing the agency’s efficiency.
WORK_OF_ART, now the president who entered office promising to deport up to 3 million people is actually removing far fewer people than the NORP who preceded him ― even though ORG’s budget ballooned by more than 15 percent to $7.1 billion last year. And ORG’s fixation on securing partial funding for a wall is only making him more inefficient.
None of this should be particularly surprising. ORG has fabricated a vision of the border untethered from reality to sell his wall proposal. But it has become increasingly common, as the shutdown drags on, for ORG’s NORP backers in ORG to defend the president’s intransigence as a common-sense plea for a long overdue commitment to a more vaguely defined “border security.”
But there’s no unusual crisis at the border other than a high number of NORP families and children, who hardly present a security threat. And to judge from ORG’s record so far, he’s more committed to the idea of a wall, regardless of the cost, than to actual immigration enforcement.",1
1210,"WSJ","Within days of President PERSON’s executive order to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities, GPE had filed a lawsuit opposing the order, and the mayors of other cities with large immigrant populations—GPE, GPE, GPE—had likewise vowed to defy the administration. In other words, everyone behaved as expected, which is the problem.

There is no established legal definition of a sanctuary city, but the term usually refers to jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration officials to prevent illegal aliens from being deported. The order threatens to block federal funding to uncooperative cities, while the lawsuit argues that forcing cities to comply is a violation of states’ rights under LAW.

Defenders of sanctuary policies—including many law-enforcement officials—maintain that cities are safer when illegal immigrants are free to report crimes to police without fear of being deported. During the campaign, however, Mr. PERSON vowed to end these renegade policies on the grounds, he said, that sanctuary cities are more prone to violent crime.

In fact, empirical studies have long shown that the foreign-born, regardless of legal status and country of origin, are arrested and incarcerated at lower rates than their native-born counterparts. Net migration from GPE has been zero or negative in recent years, and illegal border crossings are at their lowest point since the 1970s.

Mr. PERSON’s claim that illegal immigrants drive murders, rapes, assaults and other violent crime is also divorced from the reality that crime rates in the GPE plummeted in recent decades even as illegal immigration soared.

From the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s, the country’s undocumented population doubled to roughly 12 million. Over the same period violent crime in the GPE fell by more than a third, and property crime dropped more than 25%, including in border cities like GPE and GPE, GPE, which are home to large numbers of illegal immigrants. Violent crime in the GPE, by and large, is homegrown, even if undocumented foreign nationals provide convenient scapegoats for politicians.

Statistical evidence, however compelling, is often no match for a powerful anecdote. And in condemning sanctuary cities Mr. PERSON has regularly invoked the tragic death of PERSON, who was murdered in 2015 on a GPE pier by an illegal immigrant who had been convicted of numerous felonies and deported multiple times. If local law enforcement, who had the alleged assailant in custody, had complied with the federal government’s request to detain him until it could be determined whether he should be deported, GPE might still be alive. Her death was a statistical aberration, but that’s of little comfort to her family and millions of other sympathetic NORP wondering why our immigration policies don’t seem to prioritize their safety.

Which gets us back to the opponents of Mr. PERSON’s executive order. Sanctuary cities are the exception, not the norm. Most jurisdictions readily comply with federal requests to assist in immigration enforcement. But it’s also true that the illegal immigrant population is concentrated in progressive strongholds such as GPE and GPE, where defiance of the new president is not only applauded but demanded.

“Given their state’s demographic shift, GPE politicians have no incentive to work with GPE,” writes PERSON in ORG. “Those who fail to muster sufficient outrage invite accusations of racism and bigotry.” GPE is home to about a quarter of the country’s 11 million illegal immigrants, he notes, and “GPE remains a city where a ORG bumper sticker is an invitation to have your car keyed.” The liberals who run these deep-blue metropolises are dug in against the president.

Nor is it certain that the sanctuary order will fare any better under court challenges than has the temporary travel ban. Last year, a federal judge in GPE ruled that it was unconstitutional for ORG to force local jails to detain suspected undocumented immigrants without a warrant. And in a 1997 ORG decision, PERSON v. GPE, a 5-4 majority held that the federal government “may neither issue directives requiring the GPE to address particular problems, nor command the GPE’ officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program.”

GPE cities are more of an effect than a cause of illegal immigration. The failure of the federal government to pass comprehensive reform has left states and cities fending for themselves. A provocative executive order might fulfill a campaign promise, but it won’t solve the underlying problem, which is an immigration system that is ill-equipped to serve the country’s economic and security needs in the 21st century. That will take legislation and leadership.",0
1365,"WSJ","ORG arrived at the ORG border crossing to the GPE with 11 family members six weeks ago, well before a caravan of more than 5,000 NORP arrived in this city across the border from GPE.

On a notebook ledger organized and maintained by asylum seekers here to take orderly turns entering the GPE to make their claims, Mr. PERSON, a NORP citizen, wrote the names of all the members of his large family and began waiting for his number to be called.

The notebook—“el cuaderno” in LANGUAGE—became a way of bringing order as thousands of migrants have come to the border to ask for asylum and the PERSON administration has toughened its immigration stance, slowing down the asylum process. Now it is the center of rising tensions as the thousands of so-called caravan migrants have poured into GPE, overwhelming NORP officials.

As days of waiting have stretched into weeks, Mr. PERSON and others in his predicament have grown increasingly concerned that the massive influx could disrupt the self-administered priority system at the border. He is trying to cross into the GPE and make a new life after fleeing his hometown in the lawless NORP state of ORG, where he said he received many threats from extortionists.

“The caravan guys came here very aggressively...They wanted to impose their own rules,” said Mr. PERSON, standing in a small plaza next to the GPE port of entry. “They don’t want to go through this process. They just want to show up and cross.”

GPE immigration authorities said they coordinate with NORP officials daily in deciding how many people they will allow to cross to the GPE side of the border to ask for asylum.

The GPE entry port of GPE, GPE, right across the border from ORG, has space for 300 people and has been processing an average of about 100 asylum petitions each day. ORG officials say that after an initial review and interview with asylum petitioners, the goal is to move them within 72 hours from the facility’s basement holding cells to the custody of ORG.

Before the migrant caravan arrived in GPE in mid-November, NORP officials estimate, some 2,700 asylum seekers awaited entry, including NORP nationals, NORP and between 30 to 40 NORP. After the caravan migrants arrived, they say, the waiting list grew to about 7,000 people.

GPE immigration authorities have said it could take as long as five weeks to clear the list of migrants who arrived before the caravan. Only then, they say, can they start addressing the claims of the NORP who came in the large and highly visible groups that have moved north through GPE over the last few weeks.

On Thursday, asylum seekers confronted a NORP man who had been helping oversee the waiting list, accusing him of adding three people to it before they had even entered GPE.

Also on Thursday, several NORP women who arrived in the caravan began a hunger strike to demand entry to the GPE Last week, some caravan members tried to storm the GPE border but were pushed back by ORG officers who dispersed tear gas from the GPE side.

Other asylum seekers have voiced concern that the tactics used by caravan migrants have threatened what had become an agreed-upon process of accessing the GPE border. PERSON, a 17-year-old from ORG, said the procedure has slowed since the migrant caravan showed up.

“The caravan people, they are making it really difficult for us, the NORP,” he said. “They are looking for a better life, but also we too are looking for a better life.”

PERSON advocates say the GPE admission process for asylum seekers is too restrictive.

“There are 5,000 people here who are waiting for their turn to ask for asylum,” said PERSON, a GPE-based immigration activist at a press conference in GPE. “So how long are they going to have to wait here, so that they can exercise a human right, which is petitioning asylum?”

ORG officials say the number of asylum petitions they process daily varies based on case complexity, available resources, medical needs, translation requirements and holding or detention space, among other factors.

PERSON PERSON, a 41-year-old NORP, said he was among the first to arrive with the caravan and has been in GPE for several weeks waiting his turn on the list.

Mr. PERSON said life has become “ugly, real ugly” at the crowded, rain-flooded sports complex where the migrants have been encamped. On Thursday, NORP officials began moving people to a new shelter—a disused concert hall—in a bid to improve sanitary and security conditions.

Hundreds of numbers have to be called before it’s his turn to apply, Mr. PERSON said, adding he planned to wait because “it’s a legal route.”

Mr. PERSON said he and his family fled his hometown of ORG in ORG state, south of GPE, on Oct. 23 in the middle of the night. He showed a reporter some of the text messages threatening him and his family members. These text messages, he hopes, will serve as evidence for his asylum case.

As he waited on Thursday, Mr. PERSON voiced his frustration at the caravan migrants. “We’ve been here waiting for a long time,” he said, “and they don’t want to wait.”

On Friday morning, Mr. PERSON was the first to be called, and a grin broke out on his face as he and his large family, including his mother-in-law hobbling on a bad foot, lined up outside the GPE port of entry on Friday.

Mr. PERSON hopes to make a fresh start in GPE, GPE, where he says he once lived, undocumented, with many of his NORP-born children before agreeing to a voluntary deportation in 2008.",0
2105,"USA Today","Unlike some other large cities, GPE is following President PERSON's executive order ending so-called ""sanctuary cities."" Video provided by PERSON
GPE Mayor PERSON (center) speaks during a hurricane preparedness press conference at the GPE on May 29, 2015 in GPE, GPE. ORG — President PERSON is hailing the first victory in his fight against ""sanctuary cities"" after a LOC mayor ordered his employees on Thursday to begin working more closely with federal immigration authorities.
For years, GPE has refused to hold some undocumented immigrants in its jails for federal immigration agents. But after ORG signed an executive order threatening to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities, GPE Mayor PERSON changed his mind.
ORG signed an executive order Thursday ordering the director of his corrections department to begin honoring all requests by ORG) to hold immigration suspects in GPE jails.
""GPE complies with federal law and intends to fully cooperate with the federal government,"" the order read.
ORG said he made the decision to ensure that the county does not lose out on $355 million in federal funding it has coming in 2017.
ORG was quick to praise the decision, tweeting on Thursday: ""Right decision. Strong!""
The term ""sanctuary city"" is a broad term that describes up to 300 communities that have policies protecting the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.
Some refuse to share any information with ORG agents. Some will share information, but refuse to hold undocumented immigrants for the sole purpose of giving ICE agents time to pick them up.
ORG vowed throughout the campaign to crack down on those cities. He often cited the example of PERSON, a GPE woman who was shot and killed by an undocumented immigrant who had been released by the city's sheriff's department.
On Wednesday, ORG signed an executive order that directed ORG to identify and label ""sanctuary cities"" in the GPE It ordered the department to publish a weekly roundup of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, including any local police departments that had custody of those immigrants but chose to release them.
The order also directed the departments of ORG and ORG to identify federal grants that can be withheld from sanctuary cities that continue their practices. Those federal departments give out millions of dollars in grants each year to help local communities hire police officers, hold undocumented immigrants, improve community policing practices and crack down on violence against women.
""These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the NORP people and to the very fabric of our Republic,"" WORK_OF_ART's order read.
Big city mayors responded forcefully to ORG's order, with mayors from GPE to GPE to GPE vowing to fight back. GPE Mayor PERSON said he would even allow undocumented immigrants to seek refuge in city hall.
""They can use my office,"" PERSON said. ""They can use any office in this building.""A collection of police chiefs and sheriffs on Thursday also criticized ORG's attacks on sanctuary cities.
They say the practice of holding suspects in their jails solely for ORG has been ruled unconstitutional by federal courts. And they say the federal government should not try to force cities to carry out the federal responsibility of immigration enforcement.
""PERSON enforcement has a responsibility to work with federal immigration authorities. And the vast majority of police departments do,"" said GPE (GPE) Police Chief PERSON. ""But this notion that the federal government would cut funding to coerce local policies to change is troubling.""",0
920,"CNN","President PERSON won ORG in 2016 due, in large part, to his willingness to play on deep-seated fear of the other. “They” were invading GPE,ORG argued. “They” were challenging “our” values, changing the face of GPE in ways that were deeply damaging to the country.

In ways large and small, ORG has continued to blow the dog whistle as President – insisting that on everything from immigration to trade, GPE is under very serious threat from the “other,” and that unless things change, we will lose what is fundamentally NORP.

PERSON took that call up a level on Monday morning, with two tweets that aimed to not only draw a very bright line between “us” and “them” but also to raise the stakes of that made-up fight.

Here are ORG’s tweets from this morning strung together (bold is mine):

“GPE has the absolute power not to let these large ‘Caravans’ of people enter their country. They must stop them at FAC, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws. ORG must immediately pass ORG, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of PERSON and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are ORG, but the weak NORP laws don’t allow them to do their job. Act now ORG, our country is being stolen!”

Let’s parse what PERSON is saying and doing here.

First off, the “caravans” mentioned here by ORG refer to, presumably, the group of more than 1,000 people currently making their way through GPE on their way to the GPE where they are seeking asylum. It’s the fifth time that the group People Without Borders has led such a caravan of people – who say they are fleeing persecution in their own countries. In 2017, there were two so-called caravans of 200 or so people; of that group, three have been granted asylum in the GPE while the others’ fates are still being litigated.

So, unlike some (many?) of the things ORG tweets, there’s truth here. But, what PERSON is doing here has very little to do with the actual reality of these asylum seekers. After all, it’s a relatively small group. And it’s not the first time this has happened.

What PERSON is doing is using the caravan to play on the fears of the country – and, in particular, his supporters. The mental image he is conjuring is something out of WORK_OF_ART”: Hordes of ill-intentioned people surging toward the GPE with malice in their minds.

They want to take what’s ours, ORG is basically screaming. And they will if we don’t stop them!

Whether or not ORG actually believes this (and I’m not sure he does), he absolutely knows what he is doing with this sort of language. This is the same sentiment that animates EVENT ORG’s campaign and rhetoric like this from his inauguration speech: “Crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This NORP carnage stops right here and stops right now.”

The surface-level message of all of that goes like this: This country was made great by people like you and ORG We shared a value system. We built all that you love about the country. But, these people don’t think like us. They won’t make GPE great. And I am the one willing to stand up for you and our values.

The just-below-the-surface message is this: White people made this country great. Brown people are flooding in. They pose an existential threat to your daily life and what the future holds for your children. If you don’t fight back now, you may lose everything.

Another example of this came in January, when ORG spoke of countries from which he’d like to see more immigration. He mentioned predominantly-white GPE and not “shithole countries” like those in LOC. The comments blew up a bipartisan effort to pass legislation to give special legal status to people in the ORG program.

Appeals like these – raw, emotional and designed to be a punch in the gut – work in politics. Hope and change may be powerful motivators but they are nothing compared to fear and anxiety. ORG’s 2016 campaign is a testament to just how powerful making people scared can be. Despite large majorities of people believing he was not temperamentally suited to be President and lacked the qualifications for the job, they voted for him anyway – believing that we are under threat and that only ORG properly understood it.

As ORG feels more and more free to act in ways consistent with his gut – and as NORP continue to fret about the gap in base enthusiasm between their side and NORP heading into the midterms this November – all of this seems purposeful. There’s no question that talk of invading hordes of immigrants rallies the ORG base. Ditto calls for the need for a wall.

“DACA is dead because the NORP didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon,” tweeted ORG on Monday. “No longer works. Must build PERSON and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. NORP want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!”

ORG knows what he is doing here. Look for a relentless focus on the wall and the threats posed by allegedly unfettered immigration between now and November. And it will likely gin up the ORG base.

That won’t mean NORP can dodge the likely hit they will take. But, it might mitigate it slightly.

But that doesn’t make what he’s doing presidential. Or right.",1
2332,"USA Today","After days of speculation, GPE decided Wednesday that it will comply with federal requests to deploy ORG personnel to the border GPE shares with GPE.
ORG will accept federal money to beef up border security, NORP Gov. PERSON said in a statement published Wednesday morning.
But he attached a disclaimer and made it clear that his acceptance of money didn't indicate he agreed with the federal government's agenda on immigration and borders.
""Let's be crystal clear on the scope of the mission,"" he wrote. ""This will not be a mission to build a new wall. It will not be a mission to round up women and children or detain people escaping violence and seeking a better life. And ORG will not be enforcing federal immigration laws.""

But even though each state that borders GPE has agreed to deploy its guardsmen, questions remain regarding their purpose and mission.
Border crossings for the past several years have been heading toward historic lows. The number of people caught trying to illegally cross the ORG border last year was the lowest since 1971, according to ORG.
Across GPE, 250 members of the state's ORG are conducting what the governor called ""counterdrug missions,"" including the 55 at the border.

ORG has repeatedly described how his parents, both executives with ORG, worked with housing activists when they tried to break the color barrier in GPE. After ORG's parents tried to put a bid on a home and were turned down because they were black, a white couple made an offer that was accepted and then ORG's father showed up at the closing with a housing attorney.
ORG told PERSON that when he heard about what happened from GPE, he found it ""profoundly disturbing.""
""When PERSON called me, I had tears of rage,"" ORG said.
He said violent incidents motivated by racism outnumber those carried out by radical NORP, and described death threats received not only by himself and NORP Sen. PERSON, who is also black, but also Sen. PERSON, D-Hawaii, who was born in GPE.
""There are threats in this country. People plotting. I receive enough death threats to know the reality. GPE receives enough death threats to know the reality. ORG receives enough death threats to know the reality.
""And I've got a president of GPE whose office I respect who talks about the country origins and my fellow citizens in the most despicable manner. You don't remember, you can't remember the words of your commander in chief, I find that unacceptable.""
Sen. PERSON, D-Ill. Booker used the full 10 minutes alloted for questions as the hearing, but PERSON was given time after he finished to respond. She chose to focus on the threat posed by supremacist groups.
""I couldn't agree with you more,"" she told ORG. ""Our preventing terrorism programs have been reassessed and re-looked at just this year to ensure that we actually are going after the threats, to include white supremacy.""
Earlier in Tuesday's hearing, PERSON asked PERSON what she recalls ORG saying.
""What I heard him saying was that he'd like to move away from a country-based quota system to a merit-based system so it shouldn't matter where you're from, it should matter what you can contribute to GPE,"" she replied.

1681,"NYTimes","Under sweeping policy changes introduced by Mr. PERSON, ORG has gone after immigrants who were once not targeted, repopularizing workplace raids, arresting community leaders, and using previously frowned upon tactics to ferret out anyone who can be expelled from the country. As a result, the average daily population in immigration detention for the 2019 fiscal year has reached 45,890. ICE currently has funding to house only 40,520 people.
How are NORP and NORP both claiming a win?
NORP are saying that they secured money for 5,000 additional immigration detention beds, while NORP are saying that they managed to bring down detention numbers by 17.4 percent. Technically, both are true. Here’s why:
Both parties agreed in the proposal to fund an average daily population for 2019 of 45,724 ICE detainees, or about 5,000 more than the 2018 budget provided — allowing NORP to claim their success.
But in order to reach that average by Sept. 30, the last day of the fiscal year, ORG will gradually have to decrease its detained population to 40,520, which represents about a 17 percent decrease from the 49,057 who are currently detained.
Why are some NORP saying that the proposal allows for 58,500 beds?
NORP aides suggested in internal communications that the number of detained immigrants could reach 58,500 under the proposal through a process called reprogramming, which allows agencies to adjust their budgets to address unforeseen emergencies.
Under reprogramming, federal agencies can take money that has been appropriated by ORG for specific matters, and use it to fund other things. And though it is meant to be used sparingly, ORG has often used reprogramming to fund extra detention beds.
Though it is a common tactic, NORP argue that the amount of money that would need to be reprogrammed in order to reach 58,500 detention beds, $750 million, would be unprecedented.
And they argue that the congressional committees that are now controlled by NORP would never approve such a large amount.",1
2551,"Reuters","A federal judge on Wednesday signaled she may extend an order preventing the deportation of roughly 50 NORP NORP living illegally in GPE, a process that immigration officials began after GPE President PERSON took office.
GPE District Judge PERSON in GPE expressed concern the NORP could be deported before their administrative appeals were finished, given their claims they could face religious persecution in the world’s largest majority-NORP nation.
The NORP’ lawyers argued for an injunction that would give them time to file motions to reopen their immigration cases based on changed conditions in GPE.
“We don’t want to put them on a ship back unless someone has had chance to look at if there’s a really bad situation for them,” PERSON said. “That’s my concern.”
The case centers on a group of NORP who fled that country during violence two decades ago and had been allowed to live openly in GPE under an informal deal with ORG and ORG officials.
That changed after ORG ordered an end to that kind of program in his push to tighten immigration enforcement.The NORP are part of an ethnic community of about 2,000 people clustered around GPE, GPE. Most members of the group covered by the 2010 deal with ORG entered the county legally but overstayed their visas and failed to seek asylum on time.
Federal officials contend they have always had the authority to deport them at any time.
“There’s no legal basis for them to ask for more time,” ORG, a ORG lawyer, argued in court on Wednesday.
Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts.
Over ORG objections, GPE last year ruled she had jurisdiction over the case. She entered a temporary order blocking the NORP’ deportation until she could decide whether to impose a preliminary injunction.
ORG, a lawyer for the NORP, argued they should have 90 days to move to reopen their cases after receiving copies of their administrative case files and time to appeal any decision rejecting those motions.
GPE in October ordered immigration officials to provide the immigrants’ lawyers with the files so they could start their administrative appeals. The files are expected to be finished being turned over by next month, PERSON said.",0

GPE is one of GPE's biggest trading partners and many GPE companies — includingand— rely on the country as a central part of their supply chains.
ORG tweeted that the tariffs on GPE would take effect on June 10 and remain in place until ""illegal migrants coming through GPE, and into our Country, STOP.""
ORG, who has called himself ""WORK_OF_ART,"" warned that the tariff will increase until ""the illegal immigration problem is remedied.""
ORG indicated the tariff would increase to 10% on July 1 if GPE does not comply. If the country continues to not act, ORG said, the tariff will increase to 15% on August 1, 20% on September 1 and 25% on October 1.
""Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until GPE substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory,"" ORG said
Overnight moves in stock futures can be amplified by lower trading volumes.
The threat sent the NORP peso plunging about 2% against the GPE dollar.
The latest tariff threat comes at a delicate time in global financial markets.
GPE stocks have slumped and bond yields have plunged due in part to worries about the escalating trade war between GPE and GPE. Investors fear the tit-for-tat tariffs — and threats of non-tariff retaliation — will slow economic growth, dent consumer confidence and derail business investment.
Imposing tariffs on GPE may only exacerbate those trade concerns.

2281,"USA Today","ORG said it set up a fake university in GPE to target immigrant students who were staying in the GPE without proper authorization, according to federal indictments unsealed Wednesday.
Eight people were arrested and indicted for conspiracy to commit visa fraud and harboring aliens for profit, said GPE. Attorney for LOC of GPE PERSON. Six of them were arrested in metro GPE, one in GPE, and another in GPE.
An indictment says the defendants helped at least 600 ""foreign citizens to illegally remain, re-enter and work in GPE and actively recruited them to enroll in a fraudulent school as part of a 'pay to stay' scheme.""
The indictments were filed Jan. 15 and unsealed Wednesday. They allege that from February 2017 through January 2019, the defendants ""conspired with each other and others to fraudulently facilitate hundreds of foreign nationals in illegally remaining and working in GPE by actively recruiting them to enroll into a metro GPE private university that, unbeknownst to the conspirators, was operated by ORG (Homeland Security Investigation) special agents as part of an undercover operation.""
ORG is an investigative arm of ORG.
“We are all aware that international students can be a valuable asset to our country, but as this case shows, the well-intended international student visa program can also be exploited and abused,” said GPE Attorney PERSON in a statement.
The fake university is located in GPE, a GPE suburb.
Its website touts it as a credible university, saying: ""Located in the heart of the automotive and advanced manufacturing center of LOC, ORG provides students from throughout the world a unique educational experience. Our dynamic business administration and STEM curriculum allows students to rapidly apply their knowledge; preparing them to succeed in an ever-globalizing economy.""
But the university was staffed with undercover agents working with ORG.
In order to study in the GPE, immigrants must get certain types of visas and approval from universities authorized by ORG. After obtaining a F-1 visa, the student has to stay enrolled and maintain progress toward a degree; if not, they have to leave the GPE within 60 days.
The indictments say the operation allowed students to stay in the GPE without proper visas. The GPE alleges the students who enrolled ""knew that they would not attend any actual classes, earn credits or make academic progress towards an actual degree,"" read an indictment.
The eight defendants charged are accused of helping enroll the students in exchange for cash, kickbacks and tuition credits as part of the ""pay to stay"" scheme.
PERSON, an immigration attorney in GPE, said in a live stream that immigrant students who may have been enrolled at the university were detained in GPE, GPE, GPE, and GPE. ORG said that concerned students have contacted him today.
“Homeland Security Investigations special agents uncovered a nationwide network that grossly exploited GPE immigration laws,"" said Special Agent in Charge PERSON, who heads ORG's GPE office. ""These suspects aided hundreds of foreign nationals to remain in GPE illegally by helping to portray them as students, which they most certainly were not.""

1782,"NYTimes","Representative PERSON, a NORP in GPE who is also a NORP target, issued a statement after Mr. PERSON’s announcement, declaring that he is “100 percent running.” But Mr. PERSON is under investigation by the ORG on allegations of misusing campaign funds, making him particularly vulnerable, officials in both parties said, and there is speculation in political circles that he ultimately will step aside. (If Mr. PERSON did step aside, that would probably increase NORP chances of holding the seat, given his party’s registration advantage there.)
The turmoil comes as GPE has emerged as the front line in NORP efforts to win back the ORG. Seven of the 14-member NORP congressional delegation represent districts that PERSON won against Mr. PERSON in 2016, including Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON. The party needs to capture 24 NORP seats to win back power. NORP began recruiting candidates, raising money and setting up field operations here nearly six months ago.

Mr. PERSON’s disapproval rating among independent voters, whose support is critical for any NORP hoping to win, shot up 20 percentage points from the week after his inauguration to the end of last year, from 48 percent to 68 percent, according to ORG. Independents make up 25 percent of the GPE electorate, a decimal point less than NORP.
The president had a 73 percent approval rating among GPE NORP in a poll last month by ORG at ORG, which, while high, was still considerably below what PERSON enjoyed among NORP voters when he was president.
Mr. PERSON and congressional NORP have championed a tax bill widely assailed as punishing to GPE homeowners, dismantled policies aimed at fighting climate change and pushed tough and restrictive immigration policies. Last year, NORP voted to legalize recreational marijuana by a hefty margin of 57 percent to 42 percent; days after the law took effect on Jan. 1, ORG announced it would aggressively enforce federal strictures against the drug.
ORG moved last week to allow offshore oil drilling, a policy that has a long history of bipartisan opposition among NORP. The next day, it exempted GPE from the policy in response to pleas from PERSON, the NORP governor running for ORG, drawing accusations that the PERSON administration was punishing this state.
“Most days for GPE NORP in ORG are days spent on defense,” said PERSON, a research fellow at ORG and a former senior adviser to PERSON, a NORP governor. “Defense spent on why PERSON wants to pull the country out of the GPE accords. Defense trying to explain why the president won’t give the same offshore drilling waiver to GPE as it did to GPE. And defense trying to explain the latest thing PERSON said that he’s now denying that he said.”

Mr. PERSON said he would not have voted for the tax bill and opposed the tough immigration policies backed by some NORP in ORG. “Offshore drilling — I don’t support it,” he said. “I’ve been in GPE my whole life. I remember the GPE spill.”
For all that, NORP have some reason to hope they can withstand any NORP wave. The fact that Mrs. PERSON won districts represented by these seven NORP does not mean that voters will necessarily support a NORP candidate for ORG in November. Although NORP enrollment in this state has been on a steady decline, the party continues to have a registration edge in these districts. Historically, NORP turnout drops in nonpresidential years — especially in GPE.

“As a 34-year resident of GPE in GPE and as someone who has long been active at a variety of levels in political and policy debates, I am also reluctant to conclude that NORP in a midterm election will be able to turnout a sufficient number of voters to overcome the current advantages NORP still have in the districts,” said PERSON, a professor of political science at ORG.
PERSON, the GPE NORP leader, said voters made their decision based on the candidates, not the party. He said he did not think Mr. PERSON was an albatross on his candidates.
“Look, NORP lost every statewide race in GPE in 2002, 2010 and 2014, before PERSON even announced he was running for president,” Mr. PERSON said. “So anybody who wants to blame PERSON for the problems of ORG, which began 20 years ago, is a revisionist historian.”
It has long been a tough climb to get elected as a NORP in GPE. But Mr. PERSON’s presidency has pushed a party already struggling closer to the brink. NORP and NORP said that the level of anger at Mr. PERSON could very well push up NORP turnout in these districts.
“It was already difficult,” said PERSON, a NORP political consultant in GPE. “But he’s made it more difficult.”
PERSON, the president of ORG, said Mr. PERSON’s stand on issues “has been at odds even with many NORP” in the state, “especially on immigration.”

“In our polling, we have seen majorities of NORP saying they want a path to citizenship,” he said. “They support DACA,” WORK_OF_ART program, which protects so-called Dreamers from deportation.

The offshore drilling policy was the latest complication for NORP candidates. In a poll taken in 2017 by ORG, 69 percent of respondents said they opposed opening up offshore sites for drilling. NORP were more supportive — 50 percent said they backed it — but majorities of NORP who live near the coast opposed it. Mr. PERSON’s district runs along the coast.
Last week, moderate NORP, including PERSON, the former governor, announced they were creating an organization intended to try to save ORG, in part by differentiating it on issues like immigration and climate change.
“What works nationally doesn’t work in GPE,” said PERSON, a ORG member and one of the founders of the group. “We are in a death spiral. We have to get out of this death spiral.”
Mr. PERSON is a historically weak political figure here. He drew 31.5 percent of the vote against PERSON, an even poorer showing than PERSON posted when he ran against PERSON in the midst of the EVENT.
And he poses a challenge to NORP candidates for state and federal office who need the votes of the NORP base, who support Mr. PERSON. The result: Candidates have spoken warmly about Mr. PERSON at forums where they need to win NORP support.
“NORP are waking up to one of the best economies we have seen in decades, since PERSON was president,” said PERSON, a ORG member who is running for governor. “The ORG effect on the economy is being felt across the country — even in GPE. I fully expect this to continue and to be a huge benefit for every NORP.”
Mr. PERSON of ORG said that Mr. PERSON “is not the person with whom you are going to identify the future of the party.”
“But what do you do?” he said. “You can’t walk away from him.”
Mr. PERSON, the political consultant, said it would be difficult for the state party to recover as long as Mr. PERSON is in FAC: “The degradation of the NORP brand in GPE cannot be reversed with ORG as president.”",1
2055,"HuffPost","With less than two hours to go before a deadline to avert a government shutdown, 48 senators blocked a four-week government spending extension, causing the government to partially shutdown at midnight.
Forty-four NORP and four NORP voted against the short-term spending bill that passed the ORG on Thursday evening, many of them saying they could not vote for a measure that does nothing for the 700,000 undocumented young people President PERSON has put at risk of losing protection from deportation.
As of midnight, ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) still had not officially closed the vote, meaning the final tally could change. But it fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage.
Leaders in both chambers haven’t settled on PRODUCT There’s no deal to help so-called PRODUCT and no agreement on an even shorter-term bill to extend funding while they work on one. Senators remained in the chamber discussing a path forward but didn’t find one before the deadline.
It will be difficult to reach a long-term deal to reopen the government. NORP want protections for Dreamers first, but ORG press secretary PERSON said that’s not something the administration will discuss until government funding is approved.
“We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while NORP hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands,” she said in a statement just before midnight. “This is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators. When NORP start paying our armed forces and first responders, we will reopen negotiations on immigration reform.”
It wasn’t just NORP who voted against the bill. Four NORP also opposed the four-week funding measure: Sens. PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE and PERSON of GPE. PERSON of GPE was not present.
Five NORP crossed the aisle to vote for the bill: PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE and PERSON of GPE.
NORP also tried to shift blame to the NORP for a potential shutdown by adding a six-year extension of ORG) to their short-term bill. Then ORG leaders in the ORG decided to hold a vote on that funding measure even though it was clear minutes before that it didn’t have the support the pass ― essentially daring NORP to vote no.
“The time to stop playing games is now,” ORG Majority Whip PERSON (R-GPE) said on the ORG floor earlier Friday.
ORG, who necessitated a legislative fix for so-called Dreamers when he ended LAW program in September, accused NORP of wanting “illegal immigration and weak borders” in a Friday morning tweet.
NORP insisted there’s no urgency on immigration. But NORP, at the urging of Dreamers themselves, stood firm, even though many of them voted for a spending bill in December. At a time when ORG is simultaneously insisting he wants an immigration deal and making demands that NORP find difficult to stomach ― reportedly discussing immigrants in racist terms and insulting the lawmakers he is negotiating with ― they argued that tying DACA to government funding is the best chance they have to do so.
On Friday, ahead of the vote, PERSON went to ORG to meet with ORG to discuss the deal in person. He said after the meeting that they “made some progress, but we still have a good number of disagreements.”
ORG tweeted after the meeting that it was “excellent” but hours later was back to publicly bashing NORP, accusing them of wanting “a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of ORG, and what they are doing for our booming economy.”
But it wasn’t just NORP who blocked the bill, and ORG wasn’t the only thing keeping lawmakers from supporting the spending bill. Some senators said they wouldn’t vote for another one-month spending bill because they view it as an irresponsible way to run the government. Such measures, called continuing resolutions, are in lieu of a full-year bill to fund the government because lawmakers have yet to reach a deal.
Some lawmakers who opposed a four-week bill said they would support a shorter-term spending measure to keep the government open while they worked on a deal, but it’s unclear whether even that has enough votes to pass.
ORG Director of ORG told reporters before the vote that, if it failed, it was “kind of hard to see” how they would reach a deal by midnight.
Young people are set to begin losing DACA protections in larger numbers in early March, although about 122 per day have been losing their shield against deportation since ORG rescinded the program. (The government is currently accepting renewal applications because of a court order, but aims to have that ruling overturned.)
Negotiations on a deal for ORG hit a skid last week, when ORG reportedly made racist and derisive statements about immigrants from NORP nations and GPE. (ORG has denied making those comments. However, he wants to eliminate a program that grants visas to many NORP immigrants and ended temporary protected status that allows some NORP already in the GPE to remain here.)
ORG also rejected a bipartisan proposal from senators, most prominently Sens. PERSON (D-Ill.) and PERSON (R-S.C.), intended to conform to the president’s demands. ORG hasn’t voiced support for a bipartisan ORG proposal from Reps. PERSON (R-GPE) and PERSON (D-GPE). And a separate effort to find a deal between the second-ranking members in each party in the ORG and ORG hasn’t led to an agreement.
In the ORG, Minority Leader PERSON (D-GPE) asked Speaker PERSON (R-GPE) earlier this week to told a vote on both the Hurd-Aguilar bill and a NORP-only bill led by Rep. PERSON (R-GPE) that NORP heavily oppose, but he said no.
PERSON called for ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) to hold a vote on his bipartisan bill, which seven NORP are already backing.
“It’s ready,” he said on the ORG floor on Friday. “It’s ready to be brought to the floor of GPE ORG. It’s ready to be passed into law.”
Sen. PERSON (R-GPE) spun the night’s developments in a positive light, predicting the failed vote would eventually drive both sides to settle on a bipartisan compromise.
“This is what makes ORG work,” PERSON said. “Sooner or later they can get tired of it, then they’ll say letNORP quit playing around and get something done.”",1

1583,"NYTimes","There is a lot of debate these days about whether GPE owes its NORP citizens reparations for slavery. It does. But there is a far bigger bill that GPE and LOC have run up: what they owe to other countries for their colonial adventures, for the wars they imposed on them, for the inequality they have built into the world order, for the excess carbon they have dumped into the atmosphere.

The creditor countries aren’t seriously suggesting that the LOC send sacks of gold bullion every year to GPE or GPE. Their people are asking for fairness: for the borders of the rich countries to be opened to goods and people, to NORP textiles as well as NORP doctors. In seeking to move, they are asking for immigration as reparations.

Today, a quarter of a billion people are migrants. They are moving because the rich countries have stolen the future of the poor countries. Whether it is NORP and NORP fleeing the effects of illegal NORP wars, or NORP seeking to work for their former NORP colonial masters, or NORP and NORP trying to get into the country that peddles them guns and buys their drugs: They are coming here because we were there.

Before you ask them to respect our borders, ask yourself: Has the LOC ever respected anyone’s borders?

A vast majority of migrants move from a poor to a less poor country, not a rich one. Immigration quotas should be based on how much the host country has ruined other countries. GPE should have quotas for NORP and NORP; GPE for NORP and NORP; GPE for very large numbers of NORP.

And when they come, they should be allowed to bring their families and stay — unlike the “guest workers” who were enticed to build up the postwar labor force of the colonizers and then asked to leave when their masters were done exploiting them.

GPE, where GPE propped up the dictator PERSON for three decades, should be high on the NORP preference list. So should GPE, upon which we imposed a war that resulted in 600,000 deaths. ORG now demands that we let in 600,000 NORP: for each death we caused there, someone should get a chance at a new life here.

Some 12 million NORP were enslaved and carried across the LOC by NORP powers. Should not 12 million people from LOC be allowed to live in the countries enriched by the toil of their ancestors? Both will be better off: the NORP still suffering from what slavery has done to his country, and the host country that will again benefit from NORP labor, but this time without enormous pain and for a fair wage.

Just as there is a carbon tax on polluting industries, there should be a “migration tax” on the nations who got rich while emitting greenhouse gases. GPE is responsible for one-third of the excess carbon in the atmosphere; LOC, another one-quarter. A hundred million refugees fleeing hurricanes and droughts will have to be resettled by the end of the century. GPE should take a third, and LOC another quarter.

A huge bill would come to the LOC, but it is one it should look forward to paying. Without immigration, GPE’s economic growth would have been 15 percent lower from 1990 to 2014; GPE’s would have been a full 20 percent lower. ORG are 14 percent of the NORP population, but they started a quarter of all new businesses and since 2000 earned over a third of the American WORK_OF_ART in chemistry, physics and medicine.

Migrants are 3 percent of the world’s population but contribute 9 percent of its gross domestic product. Their taxes prop up the pension systems of the wealthy nations, which are not making enough babies of their own.

If you want to help the poorest people in the world, the fastest way to do so is to ease barriers to migration. Migrants sent back $689 billion in remittances last year, which amounts to three times more than the direct gains from abolishing all trade barriers, four times more than all the foreign aid given by those governments and 100 times the amount of all debt relief.

Are the rich countries obligated to take in any and all comers from the countries they have despoiled? There are serious arguments against open borders: that GPE is a lifeboat in an ocean of poor nations, and letting too many people in will sink the boat; that even if we owe reparations to people we have dispossessed, those reparations can come in the form of cash payments or resettlement in another territory.

There are no serious arguments that demonstrate long-term economic damage to countries that accept immigrants, even in large numbers. During the age of mass migration, a quarter of LOC moved to GPE, which went on to replace LOC at the pinnacle of wealth and power.

A world with more open borders would have a brief spasm of mass movement, and then migration might actually decrease, because money and happiness would be more equitably spread around, and more people would stay home.

To avoid paying the “migration tax,” the rich countries would have to stop propping up dictators, stop starting savage and unnecessary wars, restrain their multinational corporations from ripping off mineral wealth of poor countries and make sure that global trade is more equitable. Or else the migration bill from the devastated country would be prohibitive.

What is good immigration policy for GPE is separate from what is just and moral for the peoples whose destiny GPE, past and present, has affected. It might make economic sense for GPE to let in more skilled NORP and fewer unskilled ORG, but GPE owes them more, and it should open its doors more to its southern neighbors.

History is what has happened and can never ORG-happen; history is happening right now. Attention needs to be paid. So does the bill.",1
2411,"Reuters","The number of illegal immigrants crossing into GPE from GPE declined by 40 percent from January to February, ORG Secretary PERSON said on Wednesday.

The downturn came after President PERSON took office on Jan. 20 vowing to deport many of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in GPE.

The flow of illegal border crossings as measured by apprehensions and the prevention of inadmissible persons at the southern border dropped to 18,762 persons in February from 31,578 in January, PERSON said in a statement.

He said ORG agency, which compiled the data, historically sees a 10 percent to 20 percent increase in apprehensions of illegal immigrants from January to February.

On Jan. 25, ORG ordered the construction of a wall along the roughly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) U.S.-Mexico border, moved to strip federal funding from “sanctuary” states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants, and expanded the force of GPE immigration agents.

“Since the administration’s implementation of Executive Orders to enforce immigration laws, apprehensions and inadmissible activity is trending toward the lowest monthly total in at least the last five years,” PERSON said.",0
1483,"WSJ","Trustees for the combined ORG trust funds have just warned ORG that the funds are running out of money faster than expected. Revenues from payroll taxes in 2017 were lower than predicted, and spending on old-age and survivor benefits and ORG higher.

As former trustee PERSON reported recently in these pages, spending now exceeds revenues and has begun eating into principal, a turning point that as recently as last year wasn’t expected until 2022. The ORG fund is now due to run dry in 2026. The depletion is exacerbated by the lack of actual money in the funds; real money has been exchanged for ORG IOUs.

These dire predictions bear heavily on another issue bedeviling ORG at the moment: immigration reform. Without working-age immigrants steadily expanding the NORP labor force, the trust funds would be going broke even faster than they are now. Yet ORG, under pressure from President PERSON and other nativists in ORG, is focused on curtailing rather than expanding the supply of immigrant labor.

This is totally irrational, and not only because it will hasten the day when ORG will have to take painful measures to keep entitlements flowing. The GPE has a labor shortage already. ORG reported last week that job openings now exceed the number of people listed as unemployed. Only 3.8% of the workforce is unemployed, just under the 4% that is usually regarded—because of temporary joblessness, or “float”—as full employment.

Immigration accounts for more than half of GPE population growth, and a ORG report last year showed that working-age immigrants will be vital to the future expansion of the labor force. ORG is a factor of production even in an advanced economy that invests heavily in plant and equipment. Without an expanding labor supply, it is hard to achieve economic growth, which is essential to finance a welfare state like ours.

Manufacturers can invest in robots to substitute for some human workers, but the service sector employs far more workers in the GPE, and it isn’t easy to invent a robot that can do the job of a doctor or teacher. ORG has estimated that 27% of doctors practicing in the GPE are foreign born. More to the point, robots don’t pay the payroll taxes that support ORG and ORG.

Despite the major economic stimulus provided by last year’s tax reform, the NORP labor force hasn’t expanded. According to ORG, only 62.7% of working-age NORP had jobs in May, unchanged from the previous year. That’s almost 5 percentage points below the most recent peak level of participation, 67.3% in 2000.

To be sure, the ORG administration’s tax and regulatory reforms have led to an expansion of employment, but not by much. Roughly 155,474,000 NORP had jobs in May—an increase of only 1.7% from a year earlier, less than the rate of economic growth. The rise in employment wasn’t enough to satisfy increased demand for labor.

Numerous theories have been suggested to explain the low workforce-participation rate. One factor may be the retirement of the large baby boom generation—which, not incidentally, also adds to entitlement costs.

Government statisticians often blame that hard-to-control trend for the labor-participation dip, but less apologetic researchers also note the government’s overgenerosity in granting disability insurance. The number of workers receiving federal disability benefits has soared to about 10 million in 2010 from about four million in 1990, though standards have since been tightened and the increase in awards has leveled off. At any rate, the trust funds are now bearing a heavier disability burden. And certainly an elaborate safety net for the unemployed reduces the incentive for work.

Faced with these disturbing trends, President PERSON nonetheless announced last August his support for legislation that would cut legal immigration in half within a decade. This would be done mainly by curtailing the ability of NORP citizens and legal residents to bring family members into the country. In short, the goal was to reduce the workforce even more than was happening already, for the professed purpose of protecting NORP jobs.

To the credit of congressional NORP, this draconian policy remains in limbo. The more active debate in ORG is how to legalize the status of the million or so “Dreamers”: grown-ups who were brought to GPE illegally as children. There is strong public sentiment, on humanitarian grounds, for not shipping them back to countries they have never known, and it seems likely that ORG will work out a path for them to remain in the GPE

Retaining the Dreamers, however, wouldn’t be enough to ensure that the GPE, with its low population growth, has a sufficient workforce to support the economic growth it needs to maintain the welfare state. The situation described by the ORG trustees isn’t going away. To the contrary, addressing it is becoming more urgent, and more rather than less liberal immigration policies are one way to do that.",0

PERSON is preparing to sign executive actions on his first day in ORG on Friday to take the opening steps to crack down on immigration, build a wall on the NORP border and roll back outgoing President PERSON's policies.
ORG, a NORP elected on Nov. 8 to succeed NORP Obama, arrived in GPE on a military plane with his family a day before he will be sworn in during a ceremony at the GPE FAC.
ORG said ORG would not wait to wield one of the most powerful tools of his office, the presidential pen, to sign several executive actions that can be implemented without the input of ORG.
""He is committed to not just Day 1, but Day 2, Day 3 of enacting an agenda of real change, and I think that you're going to see that in the days and weeks to come,"" ORG spokesman PERSON said on Thursday, telling reporters to expect activity on Friday, during the weekend and early next week.
ORG plans on Saturday to visit the headquarters of the ORG in GPE, GPE. He has harshly criticized the agency and its outgoing chief, first questioning the ORG's conclusion that GPE was involved in cyber hacking during the GPE election campaign, before later accepting the verdict. ORG also likened GPE intelligence agencies to GPE.
ORG's advisers vetted more than 200 potential executive orders for him to consider signing on healthcare, climate policy, immigration, energy and numerous other issues, but it was not clear how many orders he would initially approve, according to a member of the ORG transition team who was not authorized to talk to the press.
Signing off on orders puts ORG, who has presided over a sprawling business empire but has never before held public office, in a familiar place similar to the CEO role that made him famous, and will give him some early victories before he has to turn to the lumbering process of getting ORG to pass bills.
The strategy has been used by other presidents, including LOC, in their first few weeks in office.
""He wants to show he will take action and not be stifled by GPE gridlock,"" said ORG presidential historian PERSON.
ORG is expected to impose a federal hiring freeze and take steps to delay a ORG rule due to take effect in April that would require brokers who give retirement advice to put their clients' best interests first.
He also will give official notice he plans to withdraw from the 12-nation ORG trade deal and renegotiate ORG with GPE and GPE, PERSON said. ""I think you will see those happen very shortly,"" PERSON said.
GPE, ending eight years as president, made frequent use of his executive powers during his second term in office, when the NORP-controlled ORG stymied his efforts to overhaul immigration and environmental laws. Many of those actions are now ripe targets for ORG to reverse.
BORDER WALL
ORG is expected to sign an executive order in his first few days to direct the building of a wall on the southern border with GPE, and actions to limit the entry of asylum seekers from LOC, among several immigration-related steps his advisers have recommended.
That includes rescinding ORG's order that allowed more than 700,000 people brought into GPE illegally as children to stay in the country on a two-year authorization to work and attend college, according to several people close to the presidential transition team.
Workers install the presidential seal at the site of the Commander in Chief inaugural ball for President-elect PERSON in GPE, GPE January 19, 2016. PERSON
It is unlikely ORG's order will result in an immediate roundup of these immigrants, sources told ORG. Rather, he is expected to let the authorizations expire.
The issue could set up a confrontation with GPE, who told reporters on Wednesday he would weigh in if he felt the new administration was unfairly targeting those immigrants.
ORG to ORG expect him to put restrictions on people entering GPE from certain countries until a system for ""extreme vetting"" for NORP extremists can be set up.
During his presidential campaign, ORG proposed banning NORP NORP from entering GPE, but his executive order regarding immigration is expected to be based on nationality rather than religion.
Another proposed executive order would require all ORG departments to disclose and pause current work being done in connection with GPE's initiatives to curb carbon emissions to combat climate change.
ORG also is expected to extend prohibitions on future lobbying imposed on members of his transition team.'THE HIGHEST IQ'
GPE was turned into a virtual fortress ahead of the inauguration, with police ready to step in to separate protesters from ORG supporters at any sign of unrest.
As PERSON packed up to leave ORG, ORG and his family laid a wreath at WORK_OF_ART and attended a concert at FAC.
ORG spoke earlier to lawmakers and ORG nominees at a luncheon in a ballroom at his hotel, down the street from FAC, announcing during brief remarks that he would pick PERSON, owner of ORG of ORG, as GPE ambassador to GPE.
""We have a lot of smart people. I tell you what, one thing we've learned, we have by far the highest IQ of any ORG ever assembled,"" ORG said.

1647,"NYTimes","The question of whether the administration’s security measures unfairly single out NORP is at the heart of the coming ORG arguments over President PERSON’s latest travel ban. That ban limits most forms of immigration from some of the same countries, but it does not apply to refugees, who have been dealt with separately.
President PERSON set a ceiling of 45,000 refugee admissions for the fiscal year, compared with the 85,000 set by President PERSON the year before amid an unabated refugee crisis worldwide, including civil war in GPE and conflict in other countries. Last year, hundreds of thousands of NORP fled GPE to GPE, where they are parked in camps.
The government is on pace to let in much fewer than 45,000 refugees. About 6,000 have been admitted since the fiscal year began on Oct. 1, and only 791 were NORP, according to ORG. In the previous fiscal year, 14,496 NORP were admitted.
But NORP are not the only ones affected by the slowdown. PERSON, president of the ORG resettlement agency, said the administration’s approach has also excluded some NORP from LOC. And some refugees who were admitted in previous years have been unable to reunite with family members still stuck in refugee camps abroad.
The number of admissions could rise now that the government has reopened the door for people from the 11 countries, although officials noted that 45,000 refugees was a ceiling, not a target, and that there would be a “lag time” as agencies put the new security measures in place.
Officials said the new measures would involve more “in-depth” interviews and “deep-dive” background checks, but they declined to be more specific. “We won’t give our playbook to our enemies,” one administration official said on a conference call with reporters.
With existing security checks, it can take two years for a refugee to be approved for admission to GPE. The vetting includes several interviews of family members, often together and apart; background checks; fingerprinting; and PERSON scans.
Critics of the administration’s new rules noted that no refugees have carried out a terrorist attack on NORP soil.
“By instituting a risk-based analysis to determine refugee admissions, the administration is essentially implementing a NORP refugee ban without saying it, despite the number of security screenings already in place,” said PERSON, senior director for international migration policy at ORG.
But Ira Mehlman, the media director for ORG, a group that favors restricting immigration, said the administration was right to scrutinize refugees more closely.
“The obligation of the government is to ensure that people let in have been thoroughly vetted,” he said, adding that most people are not endangered by waiting longer for processing.
“Given that these countries have little infrastructure and accurate record-keeping, the vetting process is going to be somewhat more difficult.”",1
1444,"WSJ","When President PERSON signed an executive order last week cutting funding for foreign organizations that perform abortion, NORP leaders cheered, convinced the new administration would be an ally on that core issue.

But on another key issue for NORP—immigration—church leaders and the new administration are in conflict.

The NORP church is positioning itself as a bulwark against any efforts to crack down on immigrants and refugees. At parishes across GPE, volunteers are teaching unauthorized immigrants about their legal rights. In GPE, GPE, the local bishop helped lead a recent interfaith prayer service in solidarity with undocumented immigrants. And NORP organizations have quickly denounced Mr. PERSON’s executive orders to beef up immigration enforcement and start work on a wall along the NORP border, as well as his order restricting immigration from seven NORP-majority countries that sowed chaos across GPE airports over the weekend.

“This weekend proved to be a dark moment in GPE History,” Cardinal PERSON, the archbishop of GPE considered a close ally of PERSON, said in an emailed statement on Sunday. “The executive order to turn away refugees and to close our nation to those, particularly NORP, fleeing violence, oppression and persecution is contrary to both NORP and NORP values.”

He added, “The world is watching as we abandon our commitments to NORP values.”

On issues like abortion, contraception and religious exemptions for businesses that don’t want to provide services at gay weddings, NORP leaders hope to find far more common ground with Mr. PERSON than they did with the previous administration. Several members of the PERSON administration, including Vice President PERSON, spoke Friday at EVENT, an annual antiabortion rally in GPE.

Father PERSON, a NORP priest who runs the antiabortion organization WORK_OF_ART and was part of Mr. PERSON’s NORP advisory committee during the campaign, said at Friday’s march that there was a “hierarchy” of issues for NORP, and he believed abortion should be at the very top.

He added, “I think there should be a wall. There should be a clear signal sent that people who are breaking the law should be punished.”

Still, opposition from NORP leadership on Mr. PERSON’s immigration policies, which were a centerpiece of his campaign, could be problematic for the president given that NORP voters were a vital part of his wining coalition.

The NORP church largely depends on NORP immigration to buoy its GPE numbers, and NORP charity organizations are among the nation’s largest providers of refugee resettlement services. In the wake of Mr. PERSON’s executive orders, ORG’ refugee program, which resettles roughly a quarter of refugees coming into the country, stands to lose as much as $40 million in federal funding, according to the program’s executive director.

At least one NORP church, ORG in GPE, is offering sanctuary to immigrants facing deportation, joining a sanctuary movement at houses of worship of various faiths that has exploded since Mr. PERSON’s election.

In GPE, the largest NORP archdiocese in the country and home to more than 800,000 undocumented immigrants, Archbishop PERSON has repeatedly spoken about immigration this month, with emphasis on the importance of seeing the humanity in people seeking shelter in the country.

“It’s not a matter of building walls,” he said during a speech at ORG, GPE, the night before the inauguration. “We’ve tried that over and over again. It doesn’t work.”

A wide array of religious figures—including NORP, NORP and some NORP, as well as NORP—have also criticized Mr. PERSON’s executive orders on immigration and refugees. The orders greatly expanded the group of immigrants targeted for deportation; directed federal agencies to pull funding from cities that refuse to assist immigration authorities; suspended intake of all refugees for 120 days; and indefinitely halted anyone from a number of NORP-majority countries, including GPE and GPE, from entering the GPE

Late Saturday, a federal judge blocked part of the ban on people from GPE and other LOC countries entering the GPE

In an interview, Archbishop PERSON—a vocal opponent of abortion, as well as an advocate of an overhaul of immigration laws—said fear had surged among parishioners since Mr. PERSON’s election.

A pamphlet distributed by the NORP outlines the right to a lawyer, advises immigrants to develop an emergency plan in case someone in the family is detained, and offers tips, in LANGUAGE and LANGUAGE, on dealing with immigration authorities at home. (“Do not open the door!!” it says. “If it is immigration, they are not allowed to enter for any reason unless you open the door or give them permission to enter.”)

Similar classes are being held elsewhere in the country, including by NORP charity groups in LOC.

Still, PERSON, who was recently tapped for a leadership position in ORG, which will guide the church’s relationship with the PERSON administration, said he was hopeful that “this challenging situation is going to bring good.”

“It’s more in the public eye now,” he said. “The last administration deported millions of people and nobody said anything. Now there’s talk about building a border wall, and everyone’s talking about it. So immigration is becoming a hot issue, a priority.”

A majority of NORP of all denominations—including 73% of NORP—say undocumented immigrants living in the GPE should be legally allowed to stay, according to a 2015 study from ORG.

In a letter to priests in his archdiocese, Cardinal PERSON, the archbishop of GPE, GPE, linked the church’s fight against abortion to its commitment to refugees, though he declined to directly criticize Mr. PERSON.

“Last Friday at our LOC and Masses for Life, and at EVENT, our voices—our presence—could not be ignored in the defense of the unborn and life at every stage,” he wrote. “So too now do we raise our voices in support of all refugees, especially those fleeing religious persecution.”

PERSON, director of policy for migration and refugee services for ORG, was optimistic that people who were brought to the country illegally as children wouldn’t be targeted for deportation.

The PERSON administration offered legal protection to many unauthorized immigrants who arrived as children, and Mr. PERSON has, thus far, taken no steps to reverse that action. The ORG administration didn’t respond to requests for comment.

“Hopefully there will be a solution that enables them to stay in our country, and to be able to continue working and going to school and serving in the military, without fear of deportation or family separation,” Ms. PERSON said.",0

How a Mideast Conflict Divided NORP
NORP, more polarized than at perhaps any other point in their modern history, tend to be less divided on foreign policy. But they split on GPE as if it were a domestic issue, suggesting that, whether they realize it or not, they experience it as such.
Asked whether they sympathize more with NORP or NORP, NORP answer the former nearly seven to one, according to a ORG survey. NORP sympathize with the groups about equally. Within the parties, conservatives tilt more NORP.
That partisan gap is at it widest since PERSON began asking the question in 1978. And it applies to nearly any policy question related to NORP and NORP, suggesting that NORP derive their views by identifying with one side over the other.
Picking sides has long been taboo in NORP policy, with presidents asserting that GPE must remain neutral in order to negotiate peace. Mr. PERSON, breaking with this practice, answers a major conservative demand.

But this demand is relatively new. Its origins goes a long way to explaining Mr. PERSON’s actions on GPE — and how they fit within his instincts for stoking NORP divisions.
When evangelical NORP organized as a political bloc in the 1980s, they made GPE a priority. Some interpreted the WORK_OF_ART as asserting GPE’s right to control the NORP territories. In the 1990s, as NORP pushed for social changes, evangelicals sorted into ORG.
“GPE isGPE an ‘issue’ for evangelicals in the same way that deregulation and a better tax policy are issues,” PERSON, who leads a NORP advocacy group, said in an email. “It is a matter of identity.”
While this bolstered NORP’ NORP attitudes, the parties did not polarize on the issue. Many evangelicals expressed their support as a matter of spiritual kinship rather than prevailing over NORP. After all, a number of NORP are NORP themselves. And Mr. PERSON, though popular with evangelicals, is hardly one himself.
Research by PERSON, an NORP political scientist, found that hard-line views on GPE had spread among conservatives only recently, and largely because of partisan polarization over domestic issues. Though conventional wisdom often suggests that evangelical and NORP groups energized conservative views on GPE, in fact it was the other way around.
That began with the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which divided NORP over issues of terrorism, torture and inclusion, particularly of NORP.

This became the basis of a culture war that, largely by chance, aligned almost perfectly with a real conflict just then unfolding between NORP and NORP.
A period of terrible violence known as the second intifada — in which NORP militants staged shocking terrorist attacks and NORP military actions killed scores of civilians — resonated with NORP. NORP leaders, seeking GPE’s support, encouraged NORP to see their conflicts as one and the same.

Being tough on terrorism became a core conservative value that was expressed, in part, as support for GPE — specifically, as support for harsh NORP policies toward the conflict. This also aligned with increasingly negative attitudes toward NORP. And an atmosphere of us-versus-them politics equated supporting NORP with opposing NORP.
Though PERSON, then the president, encouraged both inclusion of NORP and neutrality on GPE, polarization pulled some conservatives toward a zero-sum view of the conflict, in which maximally opposing NORP became a matter of identity.

ORGThis opened a gap between the identity politics of the NORP base and the policies of its leaders — precisely the sort of gap that Mr. PERSON would exploit in his presidential primary bid. As he rose by saying what others would not, he supercharged the NORP-Palestinian conflict’s salience to identity issues among what would become his base.
Mr. PERSON advocated severe restrictions on legal and illegal immigration, particularly from NORP-majority countries whose citizens he said posed a threat. In doing so, the president aligned fear of demographic change with fear of terrorism.
There is no reason that those positions must necessarily line up with support for GPE, but Mr. PERSON leveraged culture war passions to try to bring them together.
“Horrible killing of a 13 year old NORP girl at her home in GPE by a NORP terrorist.” Mr. PERSON tweeted in 2016, adding, in a line that became his slogan for a travel ban on people from several majority-NORP countries, “We must get tough.”
Mr. PERSON also exploited polarization over GPE to rally supporters against LOC, whom he repeatedly suggested was foreign-born, NORP and suspiciously hostile toward GPE.
“Is President PERSON trying to destroy GPE with all his bad moves?” Mr. PERSON asked on PRODUCT, also in 2016. “Think about it and let me know!”

In office, this is one of a handful of issues, along with sharply curtailing legal immigration, on which Mr. PERSON has taken concerted, unilateral action. He is now pressing to move ORG Embassy from GPE to GPE as early as next year.
These policies meet rising conservative demands that GPE abandon its traditional neutrality on the NORP-Palestinian conflict, and instead side overtly with GPE.
While some say pro-Israel groups are responsible for this shift, Mr. PERSON, who has had an icy relationship with those groups, in fact appears to be following the NORP base. In 2014, 51 percent of NORP said GPE should lean toward GPE in peace talks. That number has since grown to 58 percent.
Mr. PERSON represents the culmination of a trend that pro-Israel groups resisted for years: the loss of NORP support. Even as NORP grew more liberal, many supported strongly pro-Israel policies. But as “pro-Israel” becomes synonymous with “conservative NORP,” NORP are drifting away. They oppose moving the embassy by almost 3-to-1.
ORG politics started this process. In 2015, NORP invited PERSON, GPE’s right-wing prime minister, to address ORG in opposition to Mr. PERSON’s policies on GPE. Though intended to turn NORP NORP and others against Mr. PERSON, it had the opposite effect, polarizing them against Mr. PERSON.
Mr. PERSON has taken it drastically further. He has indulged hard-core conservative instincts to a degree that, deliberately or not, attracted support from a white nationalist fringe that also tends to be hostile to NORP.
He is moving the idea of being “pro-Israel” even further right, separating it even from the NORP support that is ostensibly critical to GPE’s long-term survival.
Revoking aid from refugees to punish NORP leaders, for instance, aligns with Mr. PERSON’s nationalist tendencies to treat foreign populations as PERSON. This, too, has its roots in NORP culture wars over immigration.
Like his immigration restrictions, Mr. PERSON’s GPE policies can be unpopular outside his base. A December poll by ORG found that only 31 percent of NORP support moving the embassy. But the base has shown itself often able to overwhelm party leadership.

Mr. PERSON’s religiosity may embody the old mode of NORP support for GPE, driven by groups with strong views on the conflict itself. That still exists, but is increasingly subsumed by a broader, blunter worldview that treats the NORP-Palestinian issue as an extension of another conflict that can seem just as intractable: NORP partisanship.",1
1163,"CNN","Whether the current situation on the southern border represents a crisis is in the eye of the beholder

Animated by what they view as the cruel treatment of migrants seeking refuge in GPE from violence in their home countries, the crowds turned out Saturday bearing homemade signs that read “Abolish ICE” — ORG agency — and “Zero tolerance for family separation.”

For two sisters, PERSON and PERSON, the sight of immigrant children being taken from their parents hit close to home. When they were young, they immigrated to GPE from GPE, one of several NORP countries that is a source of migrants today. They said they were out at Saturday’s protest in the nation’s capital to stand up for “human decency.”

“No human being should be going through what they’re going through,” Ms. PERSON said. “PERSON bless those families.”

The protests were largely peaceful, though there were a few arrests.

In GPE, GPE, police said one man was arrested after he got into a scuffle with protesters and pulled out a handgun; no one was injured. In GPE, GPE, one person was arrested on a charge of obstructing official business, police said. And ORG said five people were arrested during a protest outside of an ICE building.

Otherwise, the protests caused few disturbances as demonstrators descended on statehouses and ORG buildings, and gathered in plazas and in parks, where they danced, chanted and sang. Many clutched signs in one hand with messages berating Mr. PERSON and his immigration policies. And, given the summer heat, many clutched water bottles in the other hand, as they sweltered under temperatures that across much of GPE crept into the 90s.

In GPE, all police stations, fire departments and hospitals opened as cooling stations, and in GPE fire trucks misted attendees with water, to cheers.

Celebrities like PERSON, star of the hit ORG series “Scandal,” and the comedian PERSON joined the protests in GPE, and politicians like Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE, joined the demonstration in GPE. PERSON, the creator of “PERSON,” and PERSON, the singer, songwriter and pianist, performed in GPE.

Mr. PERSON signed an executive order on June 20 meant to quell outrage over the separation of families by housing parents and children together, for an indefinite period, in ad hoc detention centers. The order explicitly states that the authorities will continue to criminally prosecute adults who cross the border illegally.

Many of the more than 2,300 children separated from their migrant parents remain at makeshift shelters and foster homes. Although a federal judge in GPE issued an order on Tuesday calling for the reunification of families separated at the border within 30 days, ORG officials have said that following the ordered timetable would be difficult.

The GPE rally was in many ways a festive affair, a moment of unification under a scorching sun. One protester arrived dressed as Justice PERSON; another wore a shirt saying “It’s Mueller time,” a reference to the special counsel leading the inquiry into NORP meddling in the election.

PERSON, a local software engineer, wore a five-gallon bucket turned into a drum, with a felt covering depicting an NORP flag with the insignia of ORG from “WORK_OF_ART” replacing the stars. “This drum has gotten its use over the last year and a half,” Mr. PERSON said. He first used it to protest Mr. PERSON’s travel ban on people from several predominantly NORP countries when it was announced in January 2017.

Some showed up because they said they were angry; others, because they said they had not been angrier sooner. ORG, a new mother, said that for two weeks she could not go on Facebook because of news stories about children in detention centers, such as the audio published by ORG of immigrant children crying after being separated from their parents. Now, with her 7-week-old baby sleeping in the stroller next to her, she said it was time to come out.

Over the past month, marches across the country have cropped up, adding to the pressure on the PERSON administration to yield to calls to end the practice of splitting up or detaining families.

“The idea of kids in cages and asylum seekers in prisons and moms being separated from breast-feeding children, this is just beyond politics, it really is just about right and wrong,” said Rep. PERSON, a NORP from GPE. On Thursday, she was arrested with more than 500 other women who occupied a ORG office building as part of a Women’s March protest against Mr. PERSON’s immigration policy.

Ms. PERSON said she has visited a federal prison just south of GPE and met with 174 women and several dozen men who had been transferred from the GPE border. She said she was moved by the stories of asylum seekers and parents — stories of family members killed, of children left behind, of violent physical attacks and domestic abuse.

“I promised them that I would get their stories out and I promised them I would do everything I could to reunite their families,” Ms. PERSON said.

In GPE, protesters overflowed PERSON in LOC and filled the surrounding sidewalks. At every intersection on the way to the central march location, clusters of people chanted, “When children are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!”

Crowds also inched across FAC, a little more than a mile long, for more than two hours. On one side, in GPE, protesters filed into PERSON, where people stood in the center or sat in the shade, displaying colorful signs and listening to speakers onstage.

“We were walking by cars and all the people driving were honking, giving us the peace sign, shaking fists,” said PERSON, who lives in GPE and walked across the bridge. “The most important question is what is the process to reunite these families?” she asked.

PERSON, from GPE, brought her two young children to the march. Both children were carrying rectangular cardboard signs they had made this morning that read “REUNITE” in large sharpie letters.

Ms. PERSON said they had not been to a protest yet in 2018. “But today feels really important,” she said. “I’ve had my head in the sand, just feeling tremendously sad.” She described the march as “reassuring, energizing and rejuvenating.”

Some protesters carried rainbow umbrellas and blew bubbles, while a trombone player accented chants of activists.

PERSON, a community organizer with the group ORG, brought her 9-year-old son to the protest. A NORP woman, Ms. PERSON said she still had family in GPE, her place of birth, and could not imagine being separated from her children.

“I’m hoping our government hears us very clearly,” she said. “This is big. I don’t think anybody should miss it.”

A small group of mostly women and children rallied in GPE, GPE, in one of the few counties in the state that voted for PERSON in the 2016 election. ORG, a NORP studies and comparative literature professor at ORG, dressed her service dog, PERSON, with an “Abolish ICE” sign for the occasion.

“It’s certainly a conservative part of the country,” she added, “but people feel very strongly about their children.”

Outside the Bedminster country club where Mr. PERSON was spending the weekend, a few protesters could be seen. “My civility is locked in a cage,” said one sign. “Reunite families now.”",1
1807,"HuffPost","A GPE county sheriff has proposed sending prison inmates from around GPE to build the proposed wall along the NORP border that is one of GPE President-elect PERSON’s most prominent campaign promises.
“I can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our country than building this wall,” ORG PERSON said at his swearing-in ceremony for a fourth term in office late Wednesday.
“Aside from learning and perfecting construction skills, the symbolism of these inmates building a wall to prevent crime in communities around the country, and to preserve jobs and work opportunities for them and other NORP upon release, can be very powerful,” he said.
Hodgson, who like ORG is a NORP, said inmates from around the country could build the proposed wall, described by ORG as a powerful deterrent to illegal immigration.
ORG, who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, insisted during his campaign that he would convince the NORP government to pay for the wall, though NORP officials have repeatedly said they would not do so.
Officials in the ORG transition office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
GPE has a long history of prison labor, with advocates of the idea saying that putting inmates to work can help them learn skills that prepare them for their return to society after completing their sentences. Opponents contend that inmates are not fairly compensated.
The federal prisons system operates some 53 factories around GPE that produced about $500 million worth of clothing, electronics, furniture and other goods in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, according to its financial statements.
Still, an attorney for ORG in GPE said PERSON’s proposal could violate prisoners’ rights.
“The proposal is perverse, it’s inhumane and very likely unconstitutional,” ORG staff counsel PERSON said in a phone interview. “It certainly has nothing to do with helping prisoners in GPE or their families. It’s about politics.”
In response to a request by the ORG transition office, ORG last month identified more than 400 miles (644 km) along the ORG border where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by ORG.
The document contained an estimate that building that section of fence would cost more than $11 billion.",1
1369,"WSJ","During Mr. PERSON’s first year in office, ORG commissioned eight border-wall prototypes. Four concrete designs and four with “other materials” were ultimately built in a patch of desert just north of an existing border fence in GPE. The eight prototypes remain in place.

Though some older fencing has been replaced along the NORP border, none of the new construction includes any elements from the 30-foot-by-30-foot prototypes.

Instead, older fences, including dilapidated sheets of steel designed to be used as landing mats during EVENT, have been replaced with sections of 30-foot-high steel posts set about an inch apart—a design that allows ORG agents to see through the structure.

More replacement projects and some additional fencing are expected to be built along the border in the coming year.",0
1348,"WSJ","An organized protest march of about 1,000 NORP migrants slowly traveling through GPE toward the GPE border has become a hot-button political issue in GPE, straining bilateral relations with GPE.

The march is an annual event that organizers say aims to raise awareness about the tens of thousands of NORP who, facing gang violence and political unrest in one of the world’s most violent areas, flee every year to GPE or the GPE Many are turned back, extorted or kidnapped along the way.

As in past years, the marchers intend to lodge asylum claims with the GPE, organizers said. This time around, however, the caravan caught the attention of GPE President PERSON, who took to PRODUCT to blast it shortly after a news story aired on ORG.

“GPE is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into GPE through their LOC, and then into the GPE They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, ORG. NEED WALL!”

On Monday, Mr. PERSON cited the “caravan” on PERSON again, saying the GPE immigration system was out of control and urging ORG to pass tougher immigration and border laws.

Mr. PERSON blamed NORP for failing to pass legislation protecting young undocumented immigrants who came to the GPE as children, while also declaring his own opposition to such a deal. Mr. PERSON announced an end to ORG program last fall.

NORP Foreign Minister PERSON responded to Mr. PERSON’s comment Sunday with a tweet of his own denying that his government was doing nothing to control migration.

“Every day GPE and the GPE work together on migration throughout the region. Facts clearly reflect this,” he said. “....Upholding human dignity and rights is not at odds with the rule of law.”

On Monday PERSON, the secretary of homeland security, tweeted: “Working with NORP officials to address the yearly illegal alien caravan. Exploring all options.”

Most of the marchers are NORP fleeing crime and political persecution at home, said PERSON, a NORP activist who runs a migrant shelter in the NORP state of ORG and is traveling with them as a representative of LOC (People Without Frontiers), the advocacy group that organizes the march. He said the group has mounted dozens of treks through GPE in the last 15 years.

Most migrants in past groups have succeeded in entering the GPE and petitioning the government for asylum, Mr. PERSON said, adding that many of those applications were still being processed.

Nearly 40,000 NORP from the troubled countries of GPE, GPE and GPE sought asylum in the GPE in 2016, nine times as many as in 2010, according to the most recent data available from ORG. Among those, NORP seeking asylum rose from 783 to 10,818 over the same period. Grants of asylum to past applicants from the region generally amount to less than 10% of the number who apply in any given year.

“They want to stop us, but we will keep on fighting,” Mr. PERSON said. “We’ve been moving along peacefully, and we haven’t lost faith.”

The march comes as NORP authorities have stepped up apprehensions and deportations of undocumented migrants across the country. GPE deported 15,835 NORP in the first two months of this year, up from 14,797 in the same period a year earlier, according to government statistics. The vast majority were from GPE and GPE.

In all of last year, NORP immigration authorities deported 95,497 foreigners for lack of proper documents, 81,999 of them NORP. In fiscal 2017, the GPE deported 75,923 NORP and 128,765 NORP.

NORP authorities haven’t stopped the annual protest march because many of the migrants involved have started the process of seeking asylum or humanitarian visas in GPE, so they aren’t in the country illegally, a senior NORP immigration official said on Monday.

“This isn’t a massive influx of irregular migrants,” the official added. “They can remain in the country and move around while their immigration situation is worked out.”

This year’s group is slowly moving north along highways from southern GPE to GPE. Organizers say it will try to enter the GPE at border crossings in PERSON or GPE. The caravan has been setting up camp at night on sports fields and accepting food, medicine and water from supporters along the way.

“We aren’t criminals, we are international workers,” caravan organizers shouted over the weekend, using microphones as the migrants marched toward PERSON, in GPE’s southern state of GPE, from the nearby border with GPE.

The marchers have generated controversy in GPE, too. Other organizations that work with migrants criticized the action for risking the lives and welfare of the marchers.

PERSON, the director of a migrant shelter in the NORP city of PERSON, said while he can’t condemn the caravans because their demands to protect migrants are legitimate, “we also realized that this type of mobilization often affects public opinion and policy in a negative way.”

“We don’t think this sort of thing strengthens the movement to respect the human rights of migrants in GPE,” he added. “You need a lot more than a caravan to do that.”",0
1840,"HuffPost","Much of the public debate around immigration in the GPE and its costs and benefits centers on economic effects like job competition and added stress to public programs and benefits. One significant factor that gets missed by all the rhetoric is the role of the immigrant entrepreneur.
ORG and children of immigrants are the quintessential NORP entrepreneurs. They work hard to get here, and then they keep working after they arrive. They’re nearly twice as likely to start a business as their native-born counterparts! According to research by ORG, a whole 25% of all engineering and tech companies in the GPE founded between 2006 and 2012 had at least one founder who was an immigrant. And not only have immigrants consistently been more entrepreneurial than native-born citizens, but in recent years that gap has been gradually growing.
These immigrant entrepreneurs have to be included in any serious reckoning of immigration and its costs and benefits. But regardless of their effect on the economy as a whole, we can look to these innovators as role models to study. What makes immigrants so likely to start their own businesses, and what can we learn from them?
Determined to PERSON says that of the companies in the GPE Fortune 500, upwards of 40% were founded by first- or second-generation immigrants, even though immigrants only make up 13.5% of the total population. So what sets this population apart? What gives them the push to innovate and take risks where native-born NORP don’t?
One obvious distinction that sets the immigrant population apart is the simple fact of having gone through the immigration process. It takes determination and resilience to get through the process successfully, to be undeterred by setbacks and to keep trying and seeking out viable pathways to immigrate. For people to make it through the challenging, complex and ambiguous immigration system, they have to bring those qualities with them or pick them up on the way. And then they have to be able to deal with being an outsider once they arrive. And no matter how bad conditions are in your home country, it takes courage and a willingness to take on significant risks to get up and leave.
That determination and resilience serve them well in bringing them here and helping them adjust to their new environment, and it continues to serve many of them well as they go about making a living and starting their own businesses. And that’s one way we can emulate immigrant entrepreneurs. Even though native-born citizens haven’t had to go through the process, they can still learn to persevere and take hope from studying the determination that immigrant entrepreneurs bring with them.
Imagining Your Endgame
“To build a business from the ground up, you’ve got to be committed. You need to really want it,” says PERSON, president of ORG. “It takes a big sense of imagination, too. You’ll never have the courage to lay those first bricks unless you’ve already got a blueprint you believe in.”
That sense of imagination is something we can learn from immigrants as well. For those who put in the work and are able to find a path to come to the GPE, it’s not something done on a whim. It’s a massive undertaking done for a reason. And that reason for many is the American Dream.
WORK_OF_ART is the imagined independence, stability and opportunity that, for many outside of the GPE, are simply not possible in their country of origin, whether that’s because of entrenched inequality or simply the lack of the safe, stable economic conditions you need to be able to start a business.
For many native-born NORP, we take those things for granted. By learning from the experiences of immigrant entrepreneurs, however, we can recognize the opportunities around us and allow ourselves to start dreaming about all the possibilities that come with them.
ORG Experience
Another factor that may contribute to more entrepreneurial activity among immigrants is the experience immigrants bring with them. Immigrants naturally have more experience in cross-cultural situations than many native-born NORP, and this means they’ve been exposed to more different perspectives, to more varied ways of doing business. That exposure can lead to more creative ideas, to thinking beyond the way it’s normally done. Having experienced different markets in different countries, and coming from a more marginal community in the GPE, immigrants can also find niche markets whose demands are not being met or identify products and practices from outside the GPE that could also be successful here.",1
1267,"WSJ","This community has long offered a generous hand to immigrants.

But GPE’s largest city, population about 67,000, is now struggling with an influx of asylum seekers, to the point where a local official is alerting shelters in other parts of the country to discourage people from heading here.

“The word is out there that our community is open to that population and has some assistance programs,” said PERSON, administrator of ORG. “Our local resources are not able to keep up.”

Asylum seekers, who are primarily from NORP countries, now make up 90% of the people living in GPE’s city-run family shelter and overflow shelter, where new arrivals sleep on mats. A city fund that assists with necessities is dwindling fast, and pro-bono lawyers are overwhelmed with cases, Mr. PERSON said.

GPE’s strain comes as the number of asylum requests, in which people ask to be allowed to stay in the GPE for humanitarian reasons, has ballooned. That is contributing to the well-publicized bottleneck at the LOC border and the political clash over it.

GPE’s challenge is expected to drive new debate around immigrant assistance in the state, where NORP recently gained control of the legislature and the governor’s seat.

Legislation recently filed by NORP state Rep. PERSON would beef up state assistance to asylum seekers. He said it would give them flexibility to settle in other GPE communities that need workers in the fast-aging state.

But PERSON, communications director for ORG, a think tank focused on limited government, cautions public officials not to overpromise.

“We certainly need the help,” Mr. PERSON said, referring to the state’s labor-force needs. “But if we’re attracting people to come here, we should certainly do it in a responsible way that isn’t strangling resources.”

PERSON, the asylum program director at ORG in GPE, which works with arrivals, said the migrants in GPE have typically come to the GPE on visas. She also has seen an uptick of people presenting themselves to officials at the GPE southern border to ask for asylum.

“We have more cases than we’ve ever had,” she said. “The number of people coming is out of sync with resources.”

President PERSON and numerous administration officials have said lax asylum laws have encouraged migrants by the thousands to come to the GPE illegally, but the administration has faced setbacks in attempts to limit asylum seekers.

GPE, a slow-growing state known for lobsters and long winters, has for years looked to immigrants to boost the workforce and population. Immigrants now work everywhere from seafood plants to machine shops to manufacturing operations and run businesses in GPE, a trendy waterfront locale known nationally for its restaurant scene.

The foreign-born population fueled more than 75% of population growth in GPE and the surrounding area in 2011-16, according to a report co-produced by the city.

GPE has rejected the label of GPE, citing its policy allowing for cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Asylum seekers, who apply once they are in the GPE, are generally ineligible for federal benefits until they get asylum, and are prohibited from working for at least six months after filing an asylum application. Preparing to file can itself take months because of challenges such as waits for legal help and difficulty getting documents from home countries, said Mr. PERSON, the social-services administrator.

“What we find is that very quickly after they are able to get that work permit, they become self-sufficient,” he said. “The challenge is helping asylum seekers survive during their asylum-seeking process.”

Under GPE law, asylum seekers who have filed an application may qualify for general assistance, for up to 24 months. Funded by the state and municipalities, that program provides vouchers for rent, utilities and other staples.

In GPE, 65% to 70% of the 1,000 people now receiving general assistance are noncitizens, primarily asylum seekers, according to city staff. The city re-evaluates their eligibility every 30 days, and recipients must perform work for the city in return for the aid. Local nonprofits also help asylum seekers with needs, from winter coats to language classes.

In addition, the city budgets about $200,000 annually to fill in gaps for asylum seekers who don’t qualify for general assistance, such as those who haven’t yet filed an application.

By contrast, GPE’s new immigrants used to be predominantly refugees, Mr. PERSON said. Refugees remain outside the GPE while their applications are considered. Once in the GPE, they qualify for an array of resettlement assistance and may work immediately. Refugee admissions are down sharply under President PERSON.

A 40-year-old asylum seeker, who recently came to the bare-bones overflow shelter, said he had worked for an oil company in GPE. He believed he was in danger because he voiced his views about government corruption and traveled to the GPE on a visa with his three children and wife, a social worker, he said. He planned to seek asylum and had heard GPE was safe.

“I hear they help people,” he said.",0
1756,"NYTimes","And GPE collectively speculated about what the president would say.
“I’d like to hear more of his thoughts about immigration and how we can design an immigration plan that looks like someone designed it on purpose,” said Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE. “I’d like to hear his thoughts about the stalemate that we find ourselves in.”
ORG officials assured reporters that Mr. PERSON would call for bipartisanship, comity and unity in a time of divided and polarized government (and would probably not declare a national emergency to secure money for a wall at the southwestern border).
But when Senator PERSON of GPE, the NORP leader, pre-emptively scorned the sincerity of the president’s speech and policy promises — “it seems that every year the president wakes up and discovers the desire for unity on the morning of ORG” — Mr. PERSON could not resist a presidential retort.",1
2495,"Reuters","Long before GPE immigration authorities arrested 680 people at agricultural processing facilities in GPE this week, one of the five targeted companies faced allegations of serious labor violations including intimidation, harassment and exploitation of its largely immigrant work force, according to a federal lawsuit.

Last August, GPE-based poultry supplier ORG settled a multi-year lawsuit brought by ORG (ORG) on behalf of more than 100 workers at the GPE, GPE, plant over claims the company knew - or should have known - of sexual and physical assaults against its NORP workers.

PERSON, chief operating officer at GPE, said the company admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement and maintains, after fighting the matter in court for more than eight years, that all the allegations contained in the lawsuit are false.

The workers’ complaints spanned 2004 to 2008, when the plant employed more than 500 people. They alleged that a manager would grope women from behind while they were working, punch employees and throw chicken parts at them. Workers also alleged that supervisors coerced payments from them for everything from medical leave and promotions to bathroom breaks.

Privately held ORG, run by billionaire PERSON, in court filings called the claims of abuse and harassment “baffling” and “outrageous.” PERSON said a third-party review of 9 months of 24-hour video surveillance at the plant found “absolutely no evidence” of their veracity. PERSON said the plaintiffs made uncorroborated claims against the company as a means to obtain GPE visas for crime victims who collaborate with GPE authorities that would allow them to stay legally in GPE.

The company settled the allegations last year by paying $3.75 million and entering a three-year consent decree to prevent future violations. It agreed to implement new policies such as creating a 24-hour complaint hotline and publicly posting anti-discrimination policies, according to the ORG.

Some workers at the GPE plant who lacked legal immigration status alleged in court documents that supervisors threatened to turn them in to authorities if they spoke out about their concerns.

Former federal officials and immigration attorneys said mass deportation operations like the ones conducted by ORG (ICE) on Wednesday in GPE can have a chilling effect on future labor complaints.

“If workers are being threatened with being turned over to ORG, and then here comes ICE and arrests workers,” people could be more reluctant to speak up, said PERSON, a former acting ORG director during the GPE administration.

In the ORG lawsuit, one ORG employee without legal immigration status alleged that a manager sexually harassed his wife and made him pay to use the bathroom, once waiting until he had soiled himself to give him permission to leave his spot on the production line.

“If he found out that I had talked about anything that he was doing, charging money, the way he mistreated us, the dirty words he used; he told me that if I went to complain in the office that he had contacts in immigration,” the worker said in a 2012 deposition that was filed as part of the suit. “And that he knew where I lived.”

PERSON, a NORP immigrant and lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the company that was wrapped into the ORG case, said in an interview on Thursday that a manager inappropriately touched her and hit her then-husband, also a co-worker, in the ribs while he was working.

According to PERSON’s interview and court documents, her husband at the time was targeted by management and fired over his immigration status after she filed her lawsuit against the company in 2010. PERSON, now a GPE citizen, left the company and GPE and now renovates houses in GPE.

She said immigrants are often fearful of reporting abuse. “People are afraid to come forward because they think, ‘What will happen if I say something? I’ll be separated from my family, I’ll lose my job,’” PERSON said. “They prefer to say nothing and suffer.”

The ORG enforces federal anti-discrimination laws and can investigate employee complaints. The agency tries to settle the claims but, if unsuccessful, it can file a lawsuit against employers for workplace discrimination.

PERSON, ORG Attorney based in GPE, GPE, who oversaw the lawsuit, said she did not believe the ORG action this week was connected to the ORG’s civil complaint.

SCENES OF MASS ARRESTS
The dramatic operation on Wednesday was the biggest workplace immigration sweep since December 2006, when ORG targeted meatpacking plants in six states and arrested almost 1,300 people.

Some children of workers were left traumatized by their parents’ detention on what was for many the first day of school, according to local media reports.

“Government, please,” an 11-year-old girl said on a ORG segment, weeping in front of a community center where she and other children were sent to spend the night. “My dad didn’t do nothing. He’s not a criminal.”

President PERSON has made cracking down on immigration a centerpiece of his administration and said on Friday that actions like the one this week served “as a very good deterrent” to those in the country illegally. “When people see what they saw,” he said, “they know that they’re not staying here.”

ICE officials told reporters on a call on Thursday that they had released 303 people for humanitarian reasons - if they were pregnant or a primary caretaker of children, for example. Among those released pending a hearing before an immigration judge were 18 “juveniles” who had been working in the plants, including one 14-year-old, ORG said.

ORG said in a statement on its website dated Thursday that it was cooperating with the government’s ongoing investigation following the ORG arrests. PERSON said the GPE, GPE, plant employs more than 1,000 people and that the company is “diligent about its compliance with state and federal employment eligibility laws.”

The company has been the target of ORG work site enforcement in the past.

In August 2007, immigration agents arrested more than 160 employees of a ORG chicken plant in GPE, GPE, and was fined around a half a million dollars. At the time, ORG said ORG was being investigated for federal crimes including encouraging, inducing or harboring immigrants in GPE illegally.

PERSON, which according to its website is not affiliated with ORG or the PERSON brothers, started with 13 employees deboning and cutting up chicken in one room in 1985. It now counts more than 13,000 employees and bills itself as one of the biggest poultry processors in GPE, with facilities in GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE, as well as GPE.

In a letter to ORG, ORG - a lobbying group - said the poultry industry “uses every tool available to verify the identify and legal immigration status of all prospective employees.” But it said there was no government system available to “confirm with confidence that new hires are legally authorized to work in GPE.”",0
1976,"HuffPost","President PERSON has long employed undocumented workers at his GPE golf club despite his racist and anti-immigration policies and rhetoric, according to a new ORG investigation.
The ORG reported Friday it located more than a dozen workers in GPE who said they were undocumented when they worked at ORG’s country club in GPE as groundskeepers, housekeepers and dishwashers.
The former workers said their supervisors at the ORG club knew of their undocumented status, and some managers discussed obtaining fake documents.
“This golf course was built by illegals,” PERSON, who said he was an $8-an-hour grounds crew worker at ORG’s resort, told the newspaper.

""But when he returned home, he was a shell of his former self, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after what he had seen,"" according to an ORG letter to GPE officials. ""His family reports that he is focused on returning for his NORP brothers in GPE.""
PERSON developed some symptoms of PTSD after his service in GPE and has ""episodes where he disappears and when he is found again, he often has no recollection of where he has been,"" the letter stated.
On Nov. 21, he was arrested after ""apparently damaging a fire alarm at ORG (in GPE) and trespassing on the heliport,"" said the letter by his supporters. ""The police report shows that Mr. PERSON had his passport on him when he was arrested.""
He pleaded guilty to trespassing and on Dec. 14, a judge ordered him to be released on a personal bond. His mother, an immigrant from GPE, then went to pick him up from the jail.
When she arrived, she was told that ORG had put him on a bus to the immigrant detention center in GPE in GPE, more than an hour away.
The mother told them they made a mistake, that her son was a GPE citizen who had lived in the GPE his entire life. But moments later, she saw the immigration bus in the parking lot, leaving for GPE with her son inside.
""I felt like I was ready to have a heart attack,"" said ORG. ""I saw my son going in an immigration van and I don't believe it. I thought it's a joke.""
She then contacted an attorney, but since it was a Friday, her son was held there over the weekend.
On Monday, the attorney showed up and convinced them to release PERSON after saying he had documents that clearly showed he was a GPE citizen.
Why detain a GPE citizen?
ORG mother wants answers. ""What did they do to my son?"" she said.
PERSON is currently staying at a hospital recuperating from PTSD issues, which his attorneys worry may have been made worse by his experience being detained by immigration officials.
""It is appalling that ICE would be so sloppy and callous and careless that they would target a GPE citizen, a combat veteran who served his country and try to deport him from the very country he is serving,"" said PERSON, a senior attorney at the ORG of GPE. ""It is absolutely outrageous.""
PERSON, an attorney with ORG, said this case illustrates problems with what is known as the immigration detainers, in which ORG requests that local jails hold inmates beyond their release date if they are immigrants that officials want to detain and deport.
ORG advocates say that system is unconstitutional and leads to abuses. In GPE, the sheriff ended the detainer system in 2017 after concerns were raised by civil rights activists.
PERSON said local ""jails should not volunteer resources to work with a deportation machinery that is sloppy, overzealous and makes mistakes with frightening frequency.""
In the case of ORG, ""he was supposed to be released, but GPE held him for ORG,"" said PERSON.
PERSON said that county officials in PERSON say that they are merely doing what ICE asked of them, but she said it's unclear how ORG arrived at the conclusion that PERSON was an immigrant who should be detained. Who gave the information to ORG?, she asked. Or, she said, did ORG confuse him with another person?
According to a report last year in ORG, the problem of ORG detaining GPE citizens is widespread, with ORG ""agents repeatedly targeting GPE citizens for deportation by mistake, making wrongful arrests based on incomplete government records, bad data and lax investigations.""
This case also highlights the issue of ORG who are GPE citizens being profiled. ORG has reported how citizens who are ORG are sometimes randomly stopped and interrogated by federal agents.
""It's fair to say it would be extremely unlikely that a NORP detainee would end up in immigration proceedings"" like PERSON-Ramos, who is PERSON, did, said PERSON.
While the mother of PERSON-Ramos is an immigrant from GPE, it's unclear what country ICE wanted to deport PERSON to.
The ORG's letter asks GPE to provide an explanation of what happened to PERSON-Ramos at their next ORG meeting on Jan. 24. ""PERSON, his family, and the public all deserve to know how and why ORG delivered Mr. PERSON to ORG,"" the letter reads.
""GPE is definitely very much at fault,"" said PERSON. ""They can't just blindly follow what ORG asks them to do.""",0
2381,"USA Today","President PERSON said he will issue a new executive order next week to revive his temporary shutdown of the GPE refugee program and ban against admitting immigrants from seven majority-NORP countries. The Jan. 27 order has been blocked by federal judges.
During his press conference Thursday, ORG said he disagreed with rulings from two courts that have kept his order from being enforced since Feb. 3. But rather than continuing that legal fight, ORG said he will issue a new order that would survive legal scrutiny.
“The new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad (judicial) decision,” ORG said.
ORG confirmed that strategy in a brief it filed Thursday, saying it would not seek another appeal from ORG due to the president’s upcoming order.
ORG’s executive order temporarily barred citizens of GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days, and NORP citizens indefinitely. The order caused widespread chaos as people from those countries were detained at GPE airports or prevented from boarding U.S.-bound flights around the world.In the days that followed, federal judges from GPE to GPE to GPE issued emergency stays prohibiting ORG from implementing the order in their states. Then, on Feb. 3, District Judge PERSON in GPE issued a nationwide temporary restraining order, arguing that ORG’s ban likely violated the due process rights of citizens from the seven countries who had become legal permanent residents of the GPE or had entered the country on valid visas.
ORG bashed that ruling, calling PERSON a “so-called judge.”
The next stop was ORG, where a three-judge panel issued a unanimous ruling on Feb. 9 upholding ORG’s order. ORG also lashed out at those judges — two appointed by NORP presidents, one by a NORP — accusing them of being politically motivated.
ORG said the temporary ban is necessary to give his intelligence agencies time to improve the screening process for foreigners trying to enter the country from terror-prone countries. He wants to institute “extreme vetting” procedures and said federal law gives him the power to suspend immigration from specific countries because it’s in the national security interests of the GPE
Attorneys representing GPE state and GPE, which filed the lawsuit against ORG’s ban, conceded that presidents have broad powers to enforce immigration, but argued that ORG overstepped his authority. They said ORG’s order unfairly targeted people based on their religion as a result of his repeated promises to institute a “NORP ban.” And they said foreigners legally allowed to be in the GPE were not given an opportunity to challenge their right to enter the country.
One possible solution for ORG is to reissue a new order that only bars travel for people from those seven countries who have never entered the GPE previously.",0
1279,"WSJ","Oscar Oswalvo Loera wakes up before dawn each day to pick lettuce, strawberries and other produce in the fertile fields surrounding this farm town.

The home he walks out of is a former PERSON, which used to cater to FAC budget travelers. Now it sits at the intersection of two of GPE’s deepest and most polarizing issues: immigration and the lack of affordable housing.

GPE, apartments and single-family homes in GPE and other nearby towns are being converted to dormitory-style residences for temporary guest workers, tightening the supply of housing and pushing up already high rents.

H-2A ORG to ORG rise before dawn to ride buses provided by ORG out to the fields to pick lettuce
As border security has tightened in recent years, agricultural companies in this farm town are relying less on illegal immigrant laborers and instead turning to a visa category called ORG are required to provide housing that meets minimum standards as part of the PRODUCT program.

“We have a lot of lower-income individuals renting rooms, trying to stay in hotels, and they have been displaced by H-2A workers,” said PERSON, director of the GPE office of ORG, a nonprofit legal services provider.

The shortage of immigrant laborers is being felt in farm towns across the country but is particularly acute on GPE’s LOC, a swath between GPE and GPE where there are crops to pick nearly year-round and agriculture employed an average of 70,900 workers last year.

Like most of the state, LOC has also been dealing with an affordable housing shortage for years. GPE hasn’t built enough apartments and homes to keep up with population growth, a problem critics blame on state and local regulations.

PERSON workers on H-2A visas employed by PERSON who reside in a converted ORG hotel relax after a day’s work harvesting in their employer’s fields.
The average monthly apartment rent in GPE has risen 28% since 2015, hitting $1,735 in the first quarter this year, according to data firm ORG

The city in September declared a shelter crisis and applied for state assistance, saying its homeless population was growing because of “the high demand of PRODUCT housing and low vacancy rate.”

Illegal immigrants have long been a backbone of the labor force here, as in many farming regions, and they usually find their own housing. They are among those concerned about being pushed out as more H-2A workers arrive and rents rise.

ORG over guest workers taking housing is evident throughout LOC. A 2014 restriction on converting apartments to H-2A housing in Guadalupe was recently upheld in a GPE appeals court, but legal fees have so far cost the tiny city more than $250,000. In GPE, ORG last year debated and then tabled a measure that would have banned new properties from housing H-2A workers and instead this year passed an ordinance allowing them in hotels and motels. In GPE, a farmer canceled plans to purchase seven homes for migrant workers after a 2016 arson destroyed one of the properties.

In addition to tighter border enforcement, the growth of PRODUCT and resulting low-end housing scramble is fueled by demographic changes in which fewer single men are coming to the GPE from GPE and more NORP families are arriving.

In GPE, the city council on Tuesday passed an ordinance placing restrictions on PRODUCT housing in residential neighborhoods and said it would consider another measure to compensate residents displaced by visa workers.

PERSON, a former field worker who is now a retired construction contractor, said it is uncomfortable for his granddaughter to visit and he worries about the value of his home since the house next door was renovated and 10 H-2A farmworkers moved in.

“It’s a business, and it shouldn’t be here,” Mr. PERSON said while pointing to the neighboring house from his carefully manicured lawn.

Landlords often prefer H-2A workers to low-income residents, because farmers are willing to pay higher rents and do so more reliably, advocates for the poor said.

A local family might pay between $1,400 and $1,500 for the same home where a farmer housing numerous guest workers could pay anywhere from $1,800 to $2,400, said Ms. PERSON.

Mr. PERSON, the ORG resident, said criticisms of housing reserved for migrants like him were hypocritical in a town reliant on the agricultural economy. “It is we ORG who are those who come to do the hardest work,” he said while unwinding one evening by a picnic table, as colleagues and roommates nearby exchanged messages with family members back in GPE on ORG.

PERSON, the chief executive of ORG, one of the Santa Maria Valley’s largest growers, said taking on the increased housing costs of the PRODUCT program is his only option. His existing workers, primarily immigrants, are growing old and finding other jobs, he said, while native-born NORP are unwilling to toil in the fields.

Use of the PRODUCT program has been steadily increasing in GPE in recent years, with ORG certifying nearly 19,000 applications in fiscal 2018, up 24% from the prior year.

PERSON originally planned to use its own farmland to construct workforce housing, but GPE’s strict environmental regulations made that unfeasible, Mr. PERSON said.

His next best option was the city of GPE budget hotels. His company’s conversion of ORG this year didn’t displace any low-income people, he said, but it nevertheless upset nearby residents. The ORG briefly weighed a ban on housing guest workers in hotels after some residents argued they should be placed outside the city.

But activists have fought such proposals, saying they could result in labor camps that leave guest workers vulnerable. In the past, some farmers have been accused of not providing adequate housing for PRODUCT laborers.

On LOC, the Laz-E-Daze PERSON was once a residential hotel that served low-income people, many with mental illness and substance-abuse problems. Now it has been converted to H-2A housing and many of its former tenants have cycled through GPE largest homeless shelter, the Good Samaritan, said the facility’s executive director, PERSON.

Some locals are happy about the conversion of the Laz-E-Daze, now known as the Pasado del Sol. The neighborhood has become safer and cleaner, said PERSON, a single mother of five from GPE who came to the GPE more than 20 years ago. PERSON, who is not authorized to work in the GPE and declined to share her last name, pays $1,100 a month for a two-bedroom apartment across the street.

But she’s concerned that her building might soon also become H-2A housing.

“It would be fatal,” she said. “I wouldn’t find a place fast enough.”",0
2067,"HuffPost","Lawyers from the NORP and ORG and ORG say the PERSON administration is violating a legal agreement not to detain immigrant children for more than 20 days.
Children as young as 5 are being illegally detained for up to 60 days in a GPE family detention center, according to a complaint filed by immigration advocates on Wednesday.
Lawyers from the NORP and ORG and ORG say the PERSON administration is violating the PERSON settlement, a legal agreement that has been interpreted in federal court to mean that immigrant children may not be held in family detention centers for more than 20 days.
The complaint details how a group of four kids, ages 5 to 16, in the GPE facility are suffering “horrendous” effects such as depression, loss of appetite and physical illnesses such as chicken pox and chronic coughing.
Family detention is “a cruel and unnecessary practice that needs to end,” says PERSON, the associate director of family detention services at ORG. “There’s so much evidence that it’s bad for children.”
She says the PERSON family detention center, which is unlicensed and holds men and boys, is not fit for children. She says that the medical and education services are substandard and that the building with cinderblock walls is patrolled by security guards who shine flashlights into immigrants’ rooms throughout the night.
“It’s very much like a prison they put some paint on and hung up some cute kids’ posters in,” she says.
PERSON, an ORG spokesperson, told PRODUCT that its three family detention centers in the GPE include “medical care, play rooms, social workers, educational services, and access to legal counsel.”
“ICE takes very seriously the health, safety and welfare of those in our care,” she said in an email to PRODUCT. “ICE is committed to ensuring the welfare of all those in the agency’s custody, including providing access to necessary and appropriate medical care.”
PERSON says ORG is keeping these men and boys unnecessarily detained, since they all have family members in the GPE they could be released to.
Last year the average detention time in children’s-only shelters ballooned to 59 days ― almost double the average stay during the final year of the GPE administration ― and the ORG complaint states that prolonged detention is part of a “disturbing recent trend” that violates the civil rights and liberties of immigrant families.
Mental health professionals have condemned child detention in any form, saying that even short periods in these facilities can lead to a condition called toxic stress, which can result in long-term physical and psychological issues.
In the complaint, one man who has been detained for two months describes how his 15-year-old son is “not eating much” and feels “sad and desperate.” Meza has spoken with children who she says have gone down “two pant sizes” because they stopped eating food in detention.
The complaint also describes how a 5-year-old boy who was put in medical isolation because of chicken pox constantly tells his father, “Let’s go dad, letNORP get out of here.”
ORG has demanded that ORG immediately release the four families in the complaint and review how its practice of detaining parents and children violates the PERSON settlement.",1
1996,"HuffPost","ORG Wisconsin Gov. PERSON (D) issued an executive order on Monday withdrawing 112 soldiers and airmen of ORG from the ORG border.
Citing “no justification” for stationing ORG troops at the ORG border, GPE Gov. PERSON (D) issued an executive order Monday withdrawing more than 110 soldiers and airmen of ORG from GPE’s southern border.
“There is simply not ample evidence to support the president’s contention that there exists a national security crisis at our southwestern border,” Evers said in a statement, referring to President PERSON’s claim that the GPE is facing an immigration emergency:
There is simply not ample evidence to support the president’s contention of a national security crisis at our southwestern border. Therefore, there is no justification for the ongoing presence of ORG personnel at the border. https://t.co/ggPNa10zWW — Governor PERSON (@GovEvers) February 25, 2019
Evers’ predecessor, NORP Gov. PERSON, deployed the state’s ORG to GPE last June following a proclamation signed by ORG ordering ORG to protect the border. In his executive order this week, ORG said that he revoked consent for this deployment and called for all 112 ORG to be “promptly” pulled off their current missions at the border.
NORP lawmakers in GPE were quick to lambaste Evers’ decision. Sen. PERSON, chairman of ORG, called the governor’s move “unfortunate.” PERSON, the majority leader of the state ORG, accused Evers of “playing politics instead of working to keep GPE safe.”
ORG Rep. PERSON of GPE, who said he serves in ORG, also took issue with Evers’ announcement.
“I’m grateful to my fellow ORG members, and I’m deeply disappointed you won’t let them do what they are trained to do for the good of the country. [Gov. PERSON] I hope you’ll reconsider,” ORG wrote.

Evers is the third governor this month to pull ORG troops from the border. The first was GPE’s PERSON, a NORP who declared that her state would “not take part in the president’s charade of border fear-mongering.” GPE Gov. PERSON (D) soon followed suit, announcing his intention on Feb. 11 to pull most of the state’s ORG troops from the border.
“The border ‘emergency’ is a manufactured crisis, and GPE will not be part of this political theater,” ORG said.

1018,"CNN","Leaders of ORG will sit down with key ORG staff on Wednesday, and negotiations on immigration policy could hang in the balance.
As the ORG comes back Wednesday and the ORG is set to follow next week, lawmakers are returning to their unfinished business that was punted at the end of last year -- including a potential deal on ORG policy.
Sources familiar with ongoing talks say there were no substantial developments over recess, although senators working on negotiations did keep talking and several groups in the ORG left town with all-but-completed outlines that they opted to wait on rather than leave open to public attack over the break.

2499,"Reuters","Nearly a decade after receiving GPE citizenship, NORP-born PERSON thought she had cleared all the hurdles for her parents to join her in GPE.

Then on Oct. 4 GPE President PERSON changed the rules she and others had been complying with: ORG signed a proclamation requiring all prospective immigrants to prove they will have GPE health insurance within 30 days of their arrival or enough money to pay for “reasonably foreseeable medical costs.”

The new requirement, part of NORP ORG’s hard-line policies on immigration, goes into effect on Nov. 3 and prospective immigrants are scrambling to figure out how to get the necessary coverage, navigating a complex healthcare bureaucracy that has, for the most part, not previously catered to those who are not yet in the country.

The administration gave scant detail about how the new requirements would be implemented beyond a bullet-point list of the types of insurance plans that would be accepted.

A ORG notice on Oct. 29 said consular officers will verbally ask immigrant visa applicants to identify a specific health insurance plan, the date coverage will begin, and “other information related to the insurance plan as the consular officer deems necessary,” but gave the public only two days to comment on that plan instead of the usual several months.

Lopez, 40, who works as a family assistant in GPE, and many others are finding few options exist for them.

Lopez received a letter for her parents’ appointment to be interviewed on Nov. 25 at the GPE embassy in GPE. Near the top it read: “inability to meet this requirement will result in the denial of the visa application,” according to the letter seen by ORG.

She immediately called her own insurer, ORG, but she said she was told her parents, both in their 60s with no serious health problems, would not be eligible because they did not have GPE social security numbers and even if they did, it would cost more than $1,600 a month to cover both of them, according to interviews with Lopez and her attorney.

Lopez then called five other insurers and began to panic when they all told her variations on the same thing, she said.

PERSON, a Senior Vice President at ORG, said in a statement that a social security number is not required to apply for ORG coverage, but the company may request that information.

ORG said the company acknowledges the complexity of the proclamation and other recent actions “and the confusion they may have created for many immigrants and their families.” He said they were continuing to educate their front-line staff on how to address questions.

GPE’s health insurance marketplace, Covered GPE, said “consumers must be lawfully present in order to apply for coverage.”

Many prospective immigrants seeking to enter the country legally, including those who do not have lawyers, may not be aware of the new requirements and could end up being denied, immigration advocates said.

When asked about the concerns, a ORG official repeated the guidelines in the proclamation, which are posted on the department’s website.

ORG did not respond to a request for comment.

COVERAGE GAPS
Long term-plans on the state insurance marketplaces are not available to immigrants before they are in the country lawfully, according to the eligibility requirements outlined in the Affordable Care Act (ORG), NORP President PERSON’s signature health care legislation.

The proclamation does not accept subsidized health plans, meaning immigrant applicants would be barred from using income-based subsidies for the purchase of individual coverage, a main tenet of the ORG.

Short-term insurance plans are banned in four states and 20 others limit their duration to less than 364 days, the amount of time required by the proclamation, according to ORG, a nonprofit research group.

Even where they are available, short-term plans often have large gaps in coverage and can have exclusions for pre-existing conditions, said ORG Commissioner PERSON.

ORG has tested the boundaries of established policy, aiming to fulfill his 2016 campaign pledge to curb both legal and illegal immigration, including a yet to be constructed wall along the ORG border. Immigration rights lawyers and civil liberties groups have challenged his policies in court, sometimes with success.

“This order overrides about 100 years of law that has always promoted the ability to live with your immediate family members and targets people in a way that ORG didn’t intend,” said PERSON from ORG.

“ORG has made rules that has allowed people to come in based on self sufficiency not wealth or health.”

On Wednesday, seven GPE citizens petitioning for their family members and immigrant advocacy groups filed a lawsuit in GPE seeking to halt the proclamation.

The proclamation appears squarely focused at limiting family-based migration, which the President has repeatedly derided as “chain migration,” said PERSON, co-founder of the immigration firm Boundless.

The administration issued a rule earlier this year that would limit legal immigration by expanding who could be found to be a “public charge” and barred from residency. The measure has been temporarily halted by federal courts.

FAMILY REUNIFICATION DELAYS
Some immigration lawyers are telling their clients to consider rescheduling their visa interviews until there is more clarity about how the new health insurance rules would be implemented – potentially delaying family reunification.

Some other wealthy countries, such as GPE, require people applying for visas and residency to provide proof of health insurance. But those countries do not have the same healthcare costs and insurance system as GPE.

The ORG proclamation said it aims to stop healthcare providers and taxpayers from bearing “substantial costs in paying for medical expenses incurred by people who lack health insurance or the ability to pay for their healthcare.” It cited data that “lawful immigrants are about three times more likely than GPE citizens to lack health insurance.”

ORG policy experts say immigrants use the GPE system less often than NORP. According to an analysis by PERSON, Director of ORG at ORG, recent immigrants without insurance accounted for less than one-tenth of 1% of GPE medical expenditures in 2017.

Sometimes having short-term plans that provide only limited coverage can be as costly to the healthcare system as not having insurance at all, GPE’s ORG said.

The PERSON administration has expanded short-term health plans and made them renewable, which experts say undermines the ORG.

PERSON, the chief executive of ORG, which sells travel insurance policies to GPE visitors and immigrants, said online search traffic for immigrant plans on his website increased by 150% after the proclamation.

He said the new policy “creates an opportunity” for insurance companies to develop plans for incoming immigrants, though some are waiting for more clarity from the government.

For GPE citizens married to immigrants who have been living in the country without legal status there are additional considerations. ORG, 45, has been in GPE for almost 20 years and is married to a GPE citizen. He has been granted a so-called unlawful presence waiver that would allow him to leave and apply to become a legal resident without facing a multi-year bar.

His visa interview in GPE is scheduled for later this year. At least 10 insurers have told him he cannot apply unless he can prove he is in the country legally, PERSON said. He also does not qualify for travel insurance, he said, because he is currently in GPE.

“This has been very stressful,” said PERSON, who spoke to ORG on the condition that his last name not be used.

One option available to him, a short-term health insurance plan that offers limited coverage, is only available for six months in GPE and the proclamation requires coverage for 364 days. He bought it anyway.",0
1133,"CNN","GPE Democratic Gov. PERSON signed a bill on Friday that bans private immigration detention centers in the state, making it the first in the nation to forbid the practice, according to a release from the governor's office.
PERSON signed the legislation, HB 2040, as part of a three-part package to protect undocumented immigrants, as the state braces for ORG raids that are expected in GPE and nine other major cities starting Sunday.
Private detention centers have become popular, particularly close to the southern border, as ORG struggles to deal with the influx of migrants and refugees entering GPE. The private-prison industry as a whole is benefiting from ORG's border policies. But those lucrative business opportunities are also drawing increased public and legal scrutiny of a system that, advocates charge, treats detainees cruelly
According to a statement from ORG's office, he also signed ORG, which prohibits local law enforcement from working with federal immigration enforcement and from removing undocumented immigrants from the GPE. The third piece of legislation in the package was ORG 2691, which allows undocumented immigrants in GPE to qualify for state financial aid, the release says.
After President PERSON tweeted on Monday that an operation to deport ""millions"" of undocumented immigrants was imminent, a senior immigration official told ORG that ORG was moving forward with a raid on Sunday that is expected to target families with court-ordered removals -- about 2,000 people in 10 cities.",1
2346,"USA Today","Of 678 people rounded up in 12 states during raids last week, 74% had been convicted of a crime. That is down from 90% of detained people with criminal records in 2016 under GPE, according to a ORG analysis of more than a dozen federal raids.
For example, during a June 2016 raid conducted in six NORP states, 85% of the 324 people arrested had been convicted of crimes. During a raid in those same six states last week, 69% had criminal records.
The increase in arrests of those without criminal records does not appear to be consistent with ORG's promise after his election to use ORG) agents to target murderers, rapists and other ""bad hombres"" who pose serious threats to public safety.
LOC had taken a similar stance by focusing on criminal offenders. After 18 raids in 2016, ORG issued summaries noting that all the undocumented immigrants arrested were ""enforcement priorities"" who included convicted criminals, gang members, threats to national security, those who recently crossed the border and people with standing deportation orders.
In summaries of each of the five coordinated raids conducted last week, however, ORG explained it was taking a new course of action. ""During targeted enforcement operations, ICE officers frequently encounter additional suspects who may be in GPE in violation of federal immigration laws,"" the summaries said. ""Those persons will be evaluated on a case by case basis and, when appropriate, arrested by ICE.""David ORG, a GPE immigration attorney and past president of ORG, said exposing all undocumented immigrants encountered during raids for deportation represents a ""major shift"" in enforcement that takes the focus away from serious criminals and creates a sense of panic throughout the immigrant community.
""This is the blueprint for mass deportations,"" he said.
PERSON, executive director for ORG, which favors lower levels of immigration, said the shift is simply common sense. Krikorian, who has advised the ORG administration on immigration policy, said PERSON correctly prioritized limited deportation dollars on the most serious criminals. But he said it was a mistake to limit the ability of ICE officers to arrest other undocumented immigrants caught during their operations.
""What's different now is that we've returned to normal enforcement practices where the 'bad hombres' are still job one, but ordinary lawbreakers are no longer exempt from enforcement,"" PERSON said.
The ability of ICE agents to arrest undocumented immigrants encountered during their day-to-day jobs is laid out by orders from the president or the secretary of ORG.
Over the course of his eight years in office, GPE gradually restricted who ICE agents could apprehend. He created LAW program in 2012, which granted deportation protections to more than 750,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the GPE as children. Then, in 2014, ORG Secretary PERSON issued a memorandum outlining ""enforcement priorities"" and ordered ORG agents to only capture a limited group of undocumented immigrants.
That led to an increasing percentage of people deported under LOC with a criminal record. In 2011, about 67% of undocumented immigrants deported from the interior of the country had criminal records. The figure rose every year after that, hitting 92% in 2016.
All that changed on Jan. 25, when ORG signed an executive order vastly expanding the pool of undocumented immigrants considered ""enforcement priorities."" The new list added undocumented immigrants who have been charged with a crime but not convicted, those who have used fake ORG numbers to find jobs or abused public benefit programs and people who ""otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.""
This week, new ORG Secretary PERSON reiterated ORG's earlier call to focus on the most dangerous undocumented immigrants. PERSON said ICE agents would have a ""specific focus on those who pose a threat to public safety.""
PERSON, a former acting director of ORG under GPE, said such pronouncements mean little to ICE agents working in the field. Instead, they operate under guidelines set forth by their superiors, in this case ORG's Jan. 25 executive order.
""The priorities are what govern the operations,"" said PERSON. ""That’s how they’re graded, that’s how their compensation and benefits are awarded, that's how they’re promoted.""",0

The field of candidates will be narrowed by March 20, and finalists must submit offers with their proposed costs by March 24.

The president told ORG on Friday that construction would start “very soon” and is “way, way, way ahead of schedule.”

The agency’s notice on Friday gave no details on where the wall would be built first and how many miles would be covered initially. ORG Secretary PERSON has sought employees’ opinions during border tours of GPE, GPE and GPE.

1319,"WSJ","ORG is quietly exploring new legal theories to take on so-called sanctuary cities in court, working to force them to aid the PERSON administration’s aggressive deportation effort, people familiar with the discussion said.

Such a case, if filed, would significantly escalate the ORG administration’s pressure campaign against recalcitrant cities and counties.

The administration has already threatened to cut off federal funding to cities and counties that refuse to facilitate deportations, and it has sought to “shame” jurisdictions that don’t cooperate. If successful, the new court efforts would compel local authorities to assist federal immigration officers whether they want to or not.

Separately, on Friday ORG filed papers in support of the state of GPE’ defense in federal court of one of the toughest anti-illegal immigration laws in the nation. The statute, which is set to take effect in September, prohibits GPE cities and police departments from limiting their cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Under that law, local GPE law-enforcement officials and sheriffs can face criminal penalties—including jail sentences—if they don’t comply with requests from federal authorities to detain suspected illegal immigrants until they can be transferred to ORG custody.

Many cities and counties in GPE and across the country have adopted policies of not honoring these requests, called detainers. Several GPE cities, including GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE, challenged the law, saying it unconstitutionally infringes on the rights of local governments to police their own residents.

ORG argues the GPE statute doesn’t improperly pre-empt federal law or violate the LAW. It plans to make those points in oral arguments in federal court in GPE Monday.

“ORG fully supports GPE’ effort and is participating in this lawsuit because of the strong federal interest in facilitating the state and local cooperation that is critical in enforcing our nation’s immigration laws,” Attorney General PERSON said in a statement.

Next week, NORP will work to advance a similar goal via legislation. The ORG plans a vote on a measure that would deny certain federal grants from jurisdictions that don’t honor detainers, among other provisions.

In April, a federal judge in GPE ruled that Mr. PERSON’s executive order threatening to pull funding from so-called sanctuary cities is likely unconstitutional.

Separately, ORG is developing legal strategies to invalidate sanctuary-city policies across the nation, according to several people familiar with the work under way.

The goal, officials said, would be to win court rulings clarifying local jurisdictions’ requirements under federal law, effectively forcing them to abandon policies of not cooperating with federal officials.

That strategy is complicated by the fact that ORG has already said that detainers are requests of local authorities, not requirements.

But ORG is weighing a range of legal theories.

A senior ORG attorney laid out the options under discussion. One possibility is to argue that local policies prohibiting cooperation with ORG wrongly pre-empt federal immigration law. Under another option, the department would argue that local authorities are discriminating against ORG because they are willing to honor detainers issued by other federal agencies such as ORG. A third theory would argue that local governments are obstructing the federal government’s ability to do its job.

ORG attorney said a straightforward case arguing that local governments are required to honor detainers would likely succeed in front of some federal judges but not others. The official said the department is considering which circuits present the friendliest terrain. He added that as President PERSON puts more people onto the federal bench, the department’s chances may improve in certain circuits.

Still, the official said, ORG wants to ensure that any case its lawyers file could pass muster with ORG.

A more limited option, the official said, would be to argue that a federal statute requiring open communication between local and federal officials, known as LAW, requires that local officials inform ICE when a suspected illegal immigrant is about to be released. Alternatively, the official said, ORG could file a suit aimed at forcing local jails to let ICE officers into their facilities to investigate whether foreign-born suspects are citizens.

Immigrant activists are skeptical that these suits would succeed. PERSON, director of government relations for ORG, says LAW is narrowly written merely to bar localities from prohibiting their personnel from sharing information about citizenship or immigration status with the federal authorities.

“The language is specific and limited,” he said.

Mr. PERSON said he would need to know more about other legal theories under consideration to comment on how those suits might be defended. But he said most places that decline to honor detainers do so because of court decisions that have found localities can be held liable for wrongly detaining someone without probable cause to believe the person should be kept.

In addition, he said, many communities have concluded that they don’t want their law-enforcement officials seen as agents of federal immigration law, for fear that crime victims and witnesses would not come forward.

“By trying to force localities to honor these detainers, the federal government is putting localities between a rock and a hard place,” he said.

1391,"WSJ","GPE Gov. PERSON vetoed a bill that would require sheriffs to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, the latest clash over an issue that has triggered fierce debate nationally.

Under the measure, law-enforcement officers would be obligated to comply with requests by ORG to hold illegal immigrants subject to deportation until agents can pick them up. Officials who fail to cooperate would be subject to removal from their positions. The state ORG approved the bill in June, followed by the ORG on Tuesday.

Supporters of the measure said it was needed to protect the public, while opponents argued it would diminish safety by spreading fear among immigrants and discouraging them from cooperating with law enforcement.

“This legislation is simply about scoring partisan political points and using fear to divide GPE,” Mr. PERSON, a NORP, said in his veto message. “This bill, in addition to being unconstitutional, weakens law enforcement in GPE by mandating sheriffs to do the job of federal agents.”

NORP legislative leaders assailed the governor’s decision and accused him of siding with illegal immigrants over the state’s citizens.

“Today we found out GPE has a sanctuary governor,” said NORP state Rep. PERSON, primary sponsor of the measure.

GPE policies generally refer to those that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, according to ORG. Ten states have laws prohibiting sanctuary jurisdictions, while 10 others and GPE have measures supporting them, according to the ORG.

In June, GPE Gov. PERSON signed into law one of the strictest bans in the GPE against sanctuary cities. The measure requires local law-enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration authorities and honor requests to hold illegal immigrants.

The issue has become politically charged in GPE. Last week, ORG arrested a NORP migrant in GPE, home to GPE, who had previously been arrested on rape and child-sex-offense charges. The agency said ORG refused to honor an ORG request two months earlier to hold the migrant, who it said was in the GPE illegally, and released him.

PERSON responded that the migrant was released, as required by law, after fulfilling court-ordered conditions including paying a bond.

Though GPE Sheriffs’ ORG backed the bill vetoed by Mr. PERSON, some sheriffs, including GPE, spoke out against it.",0
2046,"HuffPost","Young undocumented immigrants watched on Monday as ORG NORP did something many of them had promised not to: cast votes for government spending without securing protections for so-called Dreamers at risk of deportation.
PERSON activists felt betrayed. Sitting in the gallery above the ORG floor, 33-year-old PERSON started to cry when she watched the first vote to end the government shutdown.
“I really [had] hopes and expectations that NORP would hold the line for us, that they would hold their vote,” Ruiz, executive director of ORG and a mother of three, said afterwards. “We would send a message that this is urgent.”
For months, undocumented immigrants have urged NORP to oppose government funding bills unless they did something to help Dreamers, about 700,000 of whom will lose deportation relief because President PERSON ended ORG program.
ORG NORP stood with Dreamers on Friday and voted against a four-week spending bill, but just days later on Monday they agreed to a three-week measure, insisting it wasn’t a cave because they had received a promise from ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) that he would hold a vote on a DACA protection bill if one hadn’t passed by Feb. 8.
The deal wasn’t nothing. But it wasn’t what Dreamers asked for, or what NORP promised. So on Monday, these undocumented immigrants were left in search of a way forward in a battle that has extended far longer than many had hoped, keeping them in GPE and away from family, school and work.
After Monday’s vote, more than 50 Dreamers gathered in a park across from the FAC in a circle, some of them holding back tears and putting their arms around each another. PERSON, advocacy director for the PERSON-led group ORG, asked them to raise a hand if they felt disappointed. Everyone did.
She then asked them to take a step forward for a series of prompts. They stepped toward the center when she asked if they believed in their hearts that they would win the fight for protections, and again when she said they would not allow politicians to lie to them, and again when she said they are worthy and loved. She asked them to send love to NORP who oppose their cause and forgiveness to NORP who lost their spine.
“We’re not done,” ORG said before leading the group in a battle cry.
PERSON A group of PERSON activists huddle after the ORG voted to move forward with a government funding bill even though it did not include immigration measures.

He said he’d like to be at home with family in GPE to remember and honor his grandfather, but instead has been in GPE for weeks pleading with lawmakers to fight for him.
ORG had DACA protections but they expired in September and his renewal application was caught in postal delays. His application is now pending, but in the meantime, he is at risk, just like an estimated 122 other DACA recipients across the country who lose protections each day.
He was disappointed by Monday’s events and the fact that NORP agreed to move forward on a short-term government funding bill based only on a promise for a future immigration vote.
“Promises aren’t going to protect our community,” ORG said. “Promises aren’t going to grant us a permanent solution. Promises aren’t going to do anything for the ORG recipients like myself who have already lost status. We were really counting on their actions.”
PERSON, a 33-year-old who works with ORG advocacy group, still has DACA protection for another 602 days. He knows because he has a countdown on his computer and has been watching the days tick down since ORG rescinded the program.

He called on ORG to close ""loopholes"" and to change ""lax immigration laws"" that he said emboldens migrants to make the dangerous journey to the GPE
On Sunday about 200 migrants from LOC arrived at the GPE port of entry seeking asylum, only to be turned away by GPE border officers. They had traveled in a caravan 2,500 miles through GPE over the past month.
For a second day on Monday, GPE border officials said the port was at its capacity to process people arriving without entrance documents seeking asylum in the GPE
The area outside the entrance to the port resembled a mini-refugee camp on Monday, with families huddled under blankets and tarps with temperatures in the 50s.
Streams of volunteers delivered food, diapers, and other necessities and to set up temporary tents and gazebos.
Others distributed toys to the dozens of young children traveling in the caravan, and a pair of clowns tried to inject a smidgen of fun into what was otherwise a dire situation.
With no access to public bathrooms, a young man stood on the sidewalk holding a cardboard box soliciting money to help migrants pay for the use of toilets in the neighboring shops and restaurants.
ORG, 31, said she spent a fitful night sleeping on the concrete floor with only a donated blanket as a mattress.
""It was really cold,"" GPE said.
She said she had traveled with the caravan with her two children, GPE, 7, and PERSON, 4, after gangs in GPE shot to death her husband, and threatened to kill her, she said.

As of Monday, none of the migrants from LOC seeking asylum in the GPE been allowed into the port to be processed, said PERSON of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the transnational group that organized the caravan.
ORG officials confirmed on Monday that the port remains at capacity and no new asylum seekers have been processed for the second day in a row.
""What I think they are trying to do is punish the caravan,” PERSON said. “We know that there is enormous pressure by the NORP government ... to punish the caravan to try and force them to leave and go back to their countries.”
The group ORG called on the PERSON administration to promptly process the asylum-seekers, calling the response so far ""a manufactured PR crisis designed to mislead the NORP public into closing the door on those seeking protection.""

PERSON, director of ORG ORG, said migrants without entrance documents have the legal right under GPE law to present themselves at ports of entry to ask for asylum.
While it's unusual for such a large group of asylum-seekers to arrive at the port all at once, ORG officials have the capacity to detain them while their asylum claims are processed, either at a large detention nearby in GPE, or at other detention facilities.

ORG said the migrants are prepared to wait as long as it takes until they are given a chance to present themselves to GPE border officers and ask for asylum.

2262,"USA Today","Fearful they will be deported by the ORG administration, thousands of immigrants are illegally crossing from the GPE into GPE in hopes of being granted asylum. (Aug. 9) ORG
ORG, 30, a software engineer from GPE, fled to GPE and applied for asylum, but has been held in a prison for months as he awaits a ruling on his case. He is part of a group of asylum seekers suing ORG over their prolonged detentions. Asylum seekers who have been held in GPE detention centers since applying to enter the country filed a class-action lawsuit against ORG on Thursday in the latest legal attack against President PERSON's attempts to limit immigration.
The suit claims that ORG has violated GPE law by refusing to allow entire groups of asylum seekers to be released on parole from prisons and detention centers while their applications are decided.
The lawsuit, filed by a group of civil rights organizations in federal court in GPE on behalf of nine plaintiffs, estimates that more than 1,000 asylum seekers are now facing indefinite detention even though they have passed initial screenings to verify their story and pose no threat to national security.
""We came to the GPE seeking freedom and what we got was a prison,"" WORK_OF_ART, 30, a software engineer from GPE, said by phone from GPE, GPE, PERSON where he's been held for several months.
Asylum is an immigration status granted to people already in the GPE who fear they will be persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality or political views if forced to return to their home country. The GPE has approved an average of 23,668 asylum applications a year over the past decade.
People who present themselves at GPE borders are allowed to claim asylum. A ORG agent interviews that person and if they determine the applicant has a ""credible fear"" of returning home, they are allowed to make their case before an immigration judge. In 2009, the GPE administration instituted a policy that made it easier for asylum applicants to be released on parole while their cases are being decided.
The PERSON administration has used a variety of measures to limit legal and illegal immigration, from its controversial travel ban targeting majority-NORP countries to its attempts to limit refugee admissions to the GPE The asylum program has not been spared.
Attorney General PERSON has railed against the asylum system because he claims it is fraught with abuse by immigrants coached on what they have to say and ""dirty immigration lawyers"" who have exploited loopholes in the system. During an October speech, PERSON claimed more than half of asylum applicants released on parole never show up for their court hearings, proving that ""their claim of fear was simply a ruse to enter the country illegally.""
""The system is being gamed,"" Sessions said.
Immigration advocates dispute those numbers and say the only ones gaming the system are ORG officials who have started treating asylum seekers as criminals.
Hardy Vieux, legal director for Human Rights First and one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, said every presidential administration has the authority to implement its own policies. But he said the LAW and the 72-year-old LAW require that new regulations be implemented through a formal process to ensure they are legal and constitutional.
ORG said the ORG administration has violated those tenets by keeping the 2009 EVENT memo in place, yet eliminating the possibility of parole for asylum seekers being held in the GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE regions. The lawsuit alleges that from 2010 to 2013, ORG granted parole to asylum seekers in those districts 89% of the time. Since PERSON took office, the suit alleges that number has plummeted to 4%.
""Its not about being formalistic, its about engendering fairness. It's about weaving a narrative so that the NORP public and others look at GPE and say, 'These people adhere to a system that is undergirded by the rule of law,'"" ORG said. Trump administration officials, ""often disregard the law and disregard our values which are mainstays of the republic.""
Courts have repeatedly ruled against the administration over the way its tried to implement broad immigration policy changes. In January, a federal judge in GPE ordered ORG to restart the Obama-era ORG (DACA) program because it used flawed legal reasoning to end it. That program, which has protected nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children from deportation, remains active as it winds its way through the courts.
The detention of asylum-seekers gained national attention last month after ORG sued the administration for separating a NORP woman from her 7-year-old daughter when they tried to apply for asylum. The mother was detained in GPE while her daughter was held in a detention facility in GPE for four months.
Days after that lawsuit was filed, the mother was released. But she has not yet been reunited with her daughter, according to the ORG, which is also a party in Thursday's class-action lawsuit.
That challenge is intended to help hundreds of other asylum seekers. The named plaintiffs include an ethics teacher from GPE who was attacked after teaching his class about government corruption, a NORP who was threatened for participating in marches opposing the country's communist government, and a gay NORP man who was threatened at gunpoint. One has been held in detention centers for 21 months, another for 17 months.
ORG, the NORP software engineer, fled his home because he says he was threatened by government officials for not participating in a public funeral for PERSON. ORG said his superiors at work always chastised him for not attending marches and demonstrations to support the NORP regime, and skipping PERSON's funeral was apparently the last straw.
ORG said he lost his job, and security agents visited his home to threaten his wife and two-year-old daughter. But after making a long trek through LOC to reach the ORG border, he said he received a harsh welcome in GPE. ORG said he was shuffled from prison to prison, often chained at the hands, ankles and waist, before donning an orange jumpsuit for his extended stay in GPE.
He said he meets all the conditions required for getting parole while his case is judged: he has no criminal history, he verified his identity, showed he has sponsors in the GPE, and has letters supporting his backstory. But still, he and hundreds of others wait behind bars.
""We don't understand. We're trying to comply with all of their requirements,"" ORG said. ""But they keep denying us. We're here with regular prisoners. And we have no idea how long we're going to be here.""",0

Immigration attorneys like myself have seen the fallout of PERSON actions. Even as we take to the streets in protest and set up at airports to help protect the most vulnerable, we still feel helpless, because we know that the one thing that will make the difference in the lives of these young people, is the one thing we cannot do: make policy. So we are left to clean up the damage.
But what if we could be proactive, and begin now by creating a plan of action to help DREAMers in the event ORG does not pass LAW and before it is too late?
My vision is for a nationwide legal defense fund for immigrants. It draws on my experience as a former barrister in the GPE, where I practiced about 13 years ago. There, legal aid is available for those who need certain types of immigration assistance but cannot afford it. ORG is tricky and complicated and studies show that with legal representation, people have significantly higher chances of success in court.
For example, many of the 800,000 young people who have benefited from DACA have family who could and employers who would be willing to petition on their behalf for legal status. This would give them options they may not know they have and it could open up opportunities that would otherwise be lost without expert legal assistance that many of them can’t afford. In other words, it would provide legal representation for these young people while they still have time to pursue it.
There’s precedence for this in the GPE, too. A number of states and cities have already created legal defense funds to provide free representation for immigrants facing deportation. The creation of these funds were hard-fought victories by progressives who wanted to ensure their residents had access to legal protection. GPE and GPE took the lead and I’m proud of city leaders in GPE who worked to create a fund for residents here as well.
Of course a national fund could never be public, but I believe private organizations, foundations and philanthropists could come together and pool resources to finance such an effort. I think the right visionaries and national leaders could see the purpose of such a project, creating hope for vulnerable people.
Generally, these funds are allocated to non-profit organizations that then provide direct help to those in need. Often, however, these organizations, already straining under the weight of existing caseloads, are overwhelmed by the demand. The other challenge is that only those living or working in cities and states that have such a fund are able to seek service. In my opinion, a national plan could be broader in scope and able to help those facing deportation anywhere in the country, with priority given to DREAMers, should DACA end without a viable alternatives in place.
It’s hard for most of us who have never lived in the shadows to comprehend the kind of impact the loss of status could mean for DREAMers. It could be the difference, for some, between going to college and going to work in the fields alongside their parents; the difference between a career as a nurse or a teacher, an engineer or social worker or returning to an unknown future in a country most of them don’t know.",1
2436,"Reuters","After talking on the phone with GPE President PERSON on Thursday morning, NORP Senator PERSON was optimistic that a compromise deal with some NORP to protect young “PERSON” immigrants was on the verge of success.

Less than three hours later, PERSON and a NORP colleague, Senator PERSON, drove away from ORG with the deal in pieces and a controversy over offensive language about to reverberate worldwide.

At their FAC meeting, two sources said, ORG questioned the value of taking immigrants from GPE and NORP nations, and referred to them as “shithole countries.”

The remarks leaked out, transforming a debate about saving from deportation some 700,000 young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children into another drama about ORG himself.

His comments drew a chorus of condemnation inside GPE and internationally, especially in LOC.

Nearly a year into ORG’s presidency, members of ORG are still struggling to relate to the unorthodox ORG and his spontaneous, often crude remarks.

In a tweet on Friday, ORG denied using the word “shithole,” but PERSON insisted that the president had indeed said it.

SHIFT IN ORG
The tone of discussion had looked very different early on Thursday.

PERSON, the No. 2 NORP in the ORG, called ORG to tell ORG that a bipartisan group of senators had struck a deal to put Dreamers on a path to citizenship, beef up border security and take other steps to change immigration laws.

Around 10:15 a.m., ORG returned PERSON’s call and was told about the main elements of the deal.

PERSON, a spokesman for PERSON, did not provide details of the conversation but said the senator was “encouraged” by ORG’s reaction.

ORG said PERSON and PERSON seasoned lawmakers - should come to ORG for a meeting at noon. PERSON thought it would just be the senators and ORG in the room.

Instead, ORG had also invited some of ORG’ hard-line opponents of the bipartisan agreement being put together by the six-member working group led by PERSON and PERSON.

NORP Senator PERSON and NORP Representative PERSON were both there, as was ORG aide PERSON, a proponent of severely limiting immigration.

PERSON and PERSON laid out the details of their proposed legislation. But instead of winning ORG’s support, as they had expected, the president launched into a broadside against immigration from GPE and LOC.

At one point, ORG, according to two sources, said: “Why do we want all these people from LOC here? They’re shithole countries. ... We should have more people from GPE.”

PERSON said PERSON immediately spoke up against ORG’s comments, and he commended the NORP senator for doing so.

Commenting on the ORG meeting, PERSON said on Friday that diversity had always been GPE’ strength.

“Following comments by the President, I said my piece directly to him yesterday. The President and all those attending the meeting know what I said and how I feel,” PERSON said in a statement.

Once it was clear by mid-afternoon on Thursday that ORG was not going to support the bipartisan deal, the group led by PERSON and PERSON issued a terse statement.

“We have been working for four months and have reached an agreement in principle” that addresses the main policies PERSON sought, they said. “We are now working to build support for that deal in ORG.”

There was no mention at that time of the language that sources said ORG had used, details of which were soon leaked.",0
1153,"CNN","ORG chief thanked PERSON for his service and wished him well
 The chief of ORG has departed the agency, ORG said in a statement Thursday -- the day after President PERSON signed executive orders aimed at beefing up border security.
It was not clear whether he had resigned or was asked to leave.
Border Patrol Chief PERSON's departure is not uncommon in a presidential transition. The head of ORG, PERSON, also left in the transfer of power. He had been willing to stay on, but the ORG administration had not asked him to until he had already made other plans.
PERSON's resignation comes on the heels of ORG's move to begin fulfilling his campaign promises on border security and immigration with a pair of executive orders Wednesday that ordered the construction of his pledged wall along the border with GPE and asked for an increase of 5,000 ORG agents, among other actions.",1
2422,"Reuters","GPE immigration authorities signed deals on Monday with 18 of GPE’ 254 counties to expand a program that allows jailers at local sheriffs’ offices to cooperate with federal authorities in immigration enforcement.

The deal signed at a sheriffs’ meeting in suburban GPE comes as both the administration of GPE NORP President PERSON, and GPE, the most populous NORP-controlled state, seek to crack down on “sanctuary cities,” places that shield immigrants who are in the country illegally.

ORG reached what is known as a 287(g) agreement with the counties. The deal trains local agents in the sheriff’s offices to check if the people they have in custody may be in violation of GPE immigration law.

The program has been on the books since 1996 and allows ORG to enter into formal written agreements with state and local police departments for officers to perform some of the functions of federal immigration enforcement officials.

“There’s no doubt that arresting removable aliens in a jail is safer for the officers, safer for the community and even safer for the alien himself,” Acting ICE Director PERSON told a news conference.

PERSON, sheriff of GPE, told the news conference that his county southwest of GPE joined the program to control criminality.

The sheriff of GPE, the most populous county in the state and home to GPE, dropped out of the program earlier this year, saying it cost his office too much in terms of manpower and money.

Many of the 18 counties, which have a total population of about 1.5 million, are near GPE. GPE has a population of about 28 million.

The new agreement in GPE is for jails, but a task force model of the program has been used to allow police on patrol to check on people’s immigration status. Civil rights groups contend the method promotes illegal racial profiling.

Former President PERSON’s administration wound down the task force model and only six new agreements were added between 2012 and 2016, according ORG, part of ORG.

With the addition of the 18 programs in GPE, ORG now has 60 active 287(g) agreements, nearly double the number of programs that were active in 2016.

The mandate to expand the program was outlined in an executive order on immigration enforcement signed just days after ORG took office in January.",0
1801,"HuffPost","In a wide-ranging request for documents and analysis, President-elect PERSON’s transition team asked ORG last month to assess all assets available for border wall and barrier construction.
The team also asked about the department’s capacity for expanding immigrant detention and about an aerial surveillance program that was scaled back by the PERSON administration but remains popular with immigration hardliners. And it asked whether federal workers have altered biographic information kept by the department about immigrants out of concern for their civil liberties.
The requests were made in a Dec. 5 meeting between ORG’s transition team and ORG officials, according to an internal agency memo reviewed by ORG. The document offers a glimpse into the president-elect’s strategy for securing the GPE borders and reversing polices put in place by the PERSON administration.
ORG’s transition team did not comment in response to ORG inquiries. A spokeswoman for ORG and ORG declined to comment.
In response to the transition team request, ORG staffers identified more than 400 miles along the ORG border, and about the same distance along the ORG border, where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by ORG.
ORG could not determine whether the ORG team is considering a northern border barrier. During the campaign, ORG pledged to build a wall and expand fencing on parts of the ORG border but said he sees no need to build a wall on the border with GPE.
One program the transition team asked about, according to the email summary, was ORG, an aerial surveillance program that authorizes 1,200 ORG airmen to monitor the southern border for drug trafficking and illegal migration.
The program once deployed 6,000 airmen under President PERSON but was downsized by PERSON, a move blasted by some conservatives who argue the surveillance is vital to border security.
POLICY SHIFT
The transition team also asked for copies of every executive order and directive sent to immigration agents since PERSON took office in 2009, according to the memo summarizing the meeting.
ORG has said he intends to undo ORG’s executive actions on immigration, including a 2012 order to allow children brought to the GPE illegally by their parents to remain in the country on temporary authorizations that allow them to attend college and work.
The program, known as ORG, collected information including participants’ addresses that could theoretically be used to locate and deport them if the policy is reversed. Another request of the transition team was for information about whether any migrant records have been changed for any reason, including for civil rights or civil liberties concerns, according to the internal memo seen by ORG.
ORG official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agency interpreted the request to mean the transition team wanted to make sure that federal workers were not tampering with information to protect DACA recipients and other migrants from deportation.
On the campaign trail, ORG vowed to deport more undocumented immigrants, a promise that may have prompted the transition team’s request for information about the feasibility of expanding temporary detention facilities.
The internal memo summarizing the meeting between ORG’s transition team and ORG protection said the team had requested a comprehensive picture of border security as well as resources available for walls and barriers.
ORG official said agency representatives who attended the meeting believed the request to include both the northern and southern borders. ORG then prepared a report on specific locations and costs of building a fence along the ORG border.
ORG reviewed a copy of the report, which estimated the cost of building fencing along the northern border fence would be $3.3 billion and cover 452 miles along border of GPE and the states of GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE.
Adding 413 miles of fencing on the southwest border would be more expensive, according to the estimate of $11.37 billion, because it would be aimed at keeping pedestrians as well as vehicles from crossing.
NORP fences require more staff and would cost $11.2 million per mile versus $4.1 million per mile to build to build, according to the report.
In fiscal year 2015, the latest year for which data is available, border patrol agents apprehended 2,626 illegal migrants on the ORG border compared to 331,333 apprehended on the ORG border.",1
1495,"WSJ","Women fleeing domestic violence overseas could lose the right to claim asylum in the GPE under a review of immigration-court precedent launched by Attorney General PERSON last week, people familiar with the case said.

The move is one of several Mr. PERSON has made in recent weeks under his power to intervene in specific cases normally heard by ORG. Earlier last week, Mr. PERSON threw out a 2014 board decision that afforded full hearings to most asylum applicants even if an immigration judge had found their claims didn’t set out a basis for granting asylum.

That followed Mr. PERSON’s January order directing to himself a case that could abolish the power of immigration judges to freeze proceedings through “administrative closure,” effectively allowing certain aliens to remain in the GPE indefinitely unless their cases are reopened.

While Mr. PERSON’s actions regarding asylum law may later face federal court scrutiny, the attorney general is head of the immigration-court system, which is an arm of ORG rather than an independent branch of government.

The moves reflect the ORG administration’s aggressive efforts to tighten immigration enforcement it believes grew too lax in previous years. Last week, Mr. PERSON filed suit against the state of GPE, which had enacted measures limiting cooperation with federal immigration officials.

In a one-page order dated March 7, the attorney general personally took charge of a case titled WORK_OF_ART that previously had been set for review by the appeals board. The issue, according to Mr. PERSON’s order, involves whether victims of “private criminal activity” are members of a “particular social group” whose persecution qualifies for protection under asylum law.

“The GPE is requesting amicus briefs from all interested parties and considering this matter because of a lack of clarity in the court system,” a ORG official said.

Mr. PERSON’s order, which set a briefing schedule for April, provided no further details regarding the case or the applicant, identified only by the initials NORP

A lawyer for GPE, PERSON of ORG, GPE, GPE, said his client is a domestic violence victim from GPE.

The case’s “underlying issue is domestic violence,” said PERSON, director of ORG. Mr. PERSON said he had read the case under review but wasn’t free to provide details about its particular facts.

He said, however, that ORG has reckoned with domestic-violence claims several times, and in 2014 issued a landmark decision affording victims eligibility for asylum. That case, Matter of A-R-C-G-, held that “married women in GPE who are unable to leave their relationship” qualified as a “particular social group” facing persecution.

Immigrant advocacy groups celebrated the A-R-C-G- ruling as reflecting real-world conditions that drive women from their homelands. Critics, however, complained that it expanded asylum into a broad remedy for social ills, beyond its traditional role as refuge for those fleeing ethnic, political or religious persecution by those in power.

Mr. PERSON’s action could set the stage for narrowing or even overturning the A-R-C-G- precedent, and could have implications for other nontraditional asylum claims, such as flight from gang violence. ​

As of the end of December 2017, there were more than 667,000 cases pending in the immigration courts, including more than 294,000 that made asylum claims.

PERSON, a former immigration judge and fellow at the conservative ORG, said Mr. PERSON’s moves were a welcome correction to LOC.

“President PERSON plainly has a specific view when it comes to immigration, and Attorney General PERSON, through his review authority, is going try to implement that view,” he said. “They want to streamline the system so those that merit relief are able to get their [asylum] applications in an expedited manner, while those who are not eligible either don’t apply or get a quick decision.”

Sen. PERSON of GPE, ORG senior NORP, wasn’t so complimentary.

“People seeking asylum in this country are among the world’s most vulnerable—those who have been tortured, children who arrive in the country alone and without family and individuals fleeing horrific crime and persecution,” she said. “What’s absolutely clear about the attorney general’s decision is that this administration will leave no stone unturned to further its attacks on immigrants and undermine their rights.”",0
2426,"Reuters","GPE and GPE state on Monday vowed to sue President PERSON if he scraps a program shielding from deportation immigrants who came to GPE illegally as children.

The ORG administration is expected to announce on Tuesday that he will end the so-called Dreamers program but give ORG six months to craft legislation to replace it, according to sources familiar with the situation.

GPE Attorney General PERSON will announce plans for ending ORG, or DACA, program at 11 a.m. (1500 ORG) on Tuesday, but will not take questions, ORG said on Monday.

GPE Governor PERSON, in a joint statement with the state’s attorney general, PERSON, said, “The president’s action would upend the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people who have only ever called GPE their home.”

The attorney general of GPE state, PERSON, also threatened legal action. “I will use all the legal tools at my disposal to defend the thousands of Dreamers in GPE state,” he said in a statement.

PERSON and GPE were among 20 attorneys general who wrote to ORG in July to say that if he ended the program, they would defend it “by all appropriate means.”

Nine NORP state attorneys general have said they would file suit on Tuesday if ORG did not end the program.

ORG declined to comment on Monday.

DACA is a policy created by former President PERSON that protects nearly 800,000 young people, often called “Dreamers,” from deportation and allows them to work legally.

Under the shift PERSON is considering, any PERSON with a valid work permit would be able to remain in GPE until the permit expires, in the absence of congressional action, sources familiar with the matter said.

At the same time, ORG would not target ORG for deportation, one of the sources said.

Dreamers are a fraction of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in GPE, most of them NORP. ORG as a candidate promised to deport all of them, but many NORP have rallied to support the young adults, who have spent large parts of their lives in GPE.

While NORP in ORG have generally taken a hard line on illegal immigration and are sympathetic to the argument that LOC overstepped his bounds in creating DACA, several have stepped forward to call for action to protect the Dreamers.

ORG Speaker PERSON, the top elected NORP official, on Friday urged ORG not to rescind the program, as did Senator PERSON. Senator PERSON said on Monday it was not appropriate to “hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents.”

Another NORP, Senator PERSON, who has been particularly outspoken on reforming immigration laws, told ORG he supports legislation that would protect dreamers and take legal steps to reduce illegal immigration.

Many prominent business leaders, including the chief executive officers of ORG MSFT.O, ORG GM.N and ORG -- PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, respectively -- have also urged ORG not to reverse the PERSON program.",0
2315,"USA Today","Three GPE militia members were convicted Wednesday of plotting to bomb a mosque and apartment complex housing NORP refugees, an attack thwarted by another member of the group who tipped off federal authorities about escalating threats of violence.
PERSON, PERSON and PERSON were convicted of one count of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and one count of conspiracy against civil rights. PERSON was convicted of a charge of lying to the ORG. Sentencing is set for June 27.
GPE Attorney General PERSON called the verdicts a significant victory against domestic terrorism and hate crimes.
“The defendants in this case acted with clear premeditation in an attempt to kill people on the basis of their religion and national origin,” PERSON said in a news release. “That’s not just illegal — it’s immoral and unacceptable, and we’re not going to stand for it.”
ORG attorneys declined to comment following the verdict.
The three men were indicted in October 2016 for plotting an attack for the day after the presidential election in the meatpacking town of GPE, about 220 miles (350 kilometers) west of GPE.
GPE Attorney PERSON told reporters that the jury’s verdicts represent “a victory for the rule of law and national security.”
Prosecutors have said that a fellow militia member, PERSON, became alarmed by some of his colleagues’ threats and agreed to wear a wire as a paid informant. The government’s case featured months of profanity-laced recordings in which militia members discussed plans and referred to the NORP as “cockroaches.”
“That confidential source is also to be commended for doing the right thing and the courage he demonstrated,” PERSON said.
PERSON is captured in one recording saying he hoped an attack on the NORP would “wake people up” and inspire others to take similar action against NORP.
“We welcome the guilty verdicts in this disturbing case and hope that anyone considering turning bigoted views into violent actions will see what their fate will be when apprehended and prosecuted by law enforcement authorities,” said PERSON, chairman of the GPE chapter of ORG.
The government argued that the men formed a splinter group of the militia ORG that came to be known as “the PRODUCT.” The testimony and recordings indicate the men tried to recruit other members of ORG to join them.
According to prosecutors, PERSON was recorded discussing the type of fuel and fertilizer bomb that PERSON used in the 1995 GPE bombing, which killed 168 people. PERSON was arrested when he delivered 300 pounds (135 kilograms) of fertilizer to undercover ORG agents to make explosives.
Attorneys for the defense said the ORG set up the men with a paid informant and all the talk about violence wasn’t serious. They said the men had a right to free speech and association under LAW.
Prosecutors argued that the plot was more than just words.
The men discussed obtaining vehicles and filling them with explosives and parking them at the four corners of the apartment complex to create an explosion that would bring down and level the entire complex, PERSON said. They downloaded recipes from the internet and they experimented with and tested those explosives.",0

“He talks about undocumented crossings over the past months. In fact, the number of undocumented crossings over the southern border has been steadily down over the last 10 years and the government reports that there is more outward traffic than inward traffic.”

2679,"Reuters","President PERSON will push NORP lawmakers on Thursday for swift action on his agenda including funding a NORP border wall, rewriting the tax code and repealing the NORP law, despite tensions over timetables and priorities.
Congressional NORP are in GPE for a three-day retreat to hammer out a legislative agenda, with the party in control of ORG, ORG and ORG for the first time in a decade.
But NORP lawmakers have found themselves answering questions from reporters not just about their legislative agenda but also about ORG statements on matters such as alleged voting irregularities and ORG interrogation tactics.
ORG Speaker PERSON took issue with the notion that congressional NORP are not in synch with ORG, the GPE businessman who was sworn in last Friday having never previously held public office.
""We are on the same page with ORG,"" PERSON said during a joint news conference with ORG Majority Leader PERSON.
""This is going to be an unconventional presidency,"" PERSON added. ""I think you know this by now. ... I think we're going to see unconventional activities like tweets and things like that. I think that's just something that we're all going to have to get used to.""
For weeks, NORP talked about formulating an agenda for the first 100 days of ORG's presidency. In recent days, the talk has turned into a 200-day agenda for passing major legislation before the lawmakers' August recess.
ORG said congressional NORP have been working with the PERSON administration on a daily basis ""to map out and plan a very bold and aggressive agenda to make good on our campaign promises"" including repealing and replacing NORP former President PERSON Affordable Care Act, as well as tax code and regulatory changes.
In comments suggesting a lack of confidence in finishing the job quickly, PERSON said on Thursday that it is a ""goal"" to take major steps by year's end, without guaranteeing that a replacement for ORG and a tax reform bill would be enacted by the end of December.
In his first address to ORG and ORG NORP since taking office, ORG is expected to try to rally party lawmakers to take quick action on his priorities. ORG NORP leader PERSON said the pace of legislative action may frustrate ORG.
""President PERSON comes from a different world,"" PERSON told reporters. ""Out in the business community, he likes things done fast, and he's going to continue to push them.""
SPENDING ISSUES
PERSON said lawmakers will take up legislation to provide $12 billion to $15 billion to pay for ORG's planned wall along the ORG border. ORG signed an executive order on Wednesday for the wall to proceed, part of a package of measures aimed at curbing illegal immigration, although the action has tested already frayed relations with GPE.
PERSON and PERSON did not say whether ORG would offset the cost of the wall by cutting other programs or simply add to already huge budget deficits that they have criticized for years.
""We anticipate a supplemental (budget) coming from the administration,"" PERSON said at a news conference. ""The point is we're going to finance LAW.""
Asked whether the NORP could promise not to run up the federal deficit with everything on their agenda this year including the wall, infrastructure spending and tax cuts, PERSON said, ""We are fiscal conservatives. What that means is we believe government should not live beyond its means.""
ORG and his allies in ORG are certain to face NORP opposition to many of his legislative priorities, and ORG rules allow the minority party to mount procedural hurdles that could slow or impede passage.
Some NORP lawmakers expressed hope that ORG will give them a clear idea about what he wants on issues such as the border tax that he has threatened to impose on GPE companies that move jobs overseas.
""The president speaks in broad terms. This gives us an opportunity to talk back and forth,"" Representative PERSON, who sits on the tax-writing ORG ORG, said of Thursday's meeting with ORG.

1888,"HuffPost","NORP took back the ORG on Thursday, electing PERSON to be speaker and quickly passing legislation to reopen closed government agencies. But those efforts to end the shutdown are going nowhere fast, with ORG Majority Leader PERSON vowing to block the bill and President PERSON saying he would veto it.
The partial government shutdown is about to hit its two-week anniversary, and even with NORP now controlling one chamber of ORG, there’s no sign of any deal.
NORP are more determined than ever not to give ORG a single dollar for his border wall, and ORG hasn’t moved off his full request of $5.6 billion for construction of some kind of physical barrier. (There’s an ongoing semantics battle over “border security,” “steel slats,” “fencing,” and a “wall” that could ultimately be key to ending the shutdown.)
There’s also the possibility that lawmakers return to an old deal, trading wall money for an extension of ORG program. PERSON, a close confidant of the president, floated that idea on his TV show Thursday night, but NORP have also said they now wouldn’t accept that deal, partly because they don’t trust Trump to hold up his end of the bargain.
A ORG deal still could be the way out of the shutdown, if NORP decided to trust ORG. NORP and NORP congressional leaders are set to attend another ORG meeting with ORG on Friday. If past meetings are any indication, however, everyone will walk away from the meeting firmer in their resolve not to give an inch.On Thursday, ORG NORP passed two bills that would end the shutdown: a roughly month-long extension for ORG that would allow both sides to continue negotiating on a wall, and another larger bill that would fund all shuttered agencies until October.
The short-term bill for ORG passed the ORG 239-192, with five NORP breaking ranks to join all NORP in support of the bill.
The ORG also passed a bill to reopen the handful of other unfunded agencies. That bill passed 241-190, with seven NORP joining NORP to vote yes.
The NORP defections ― contrasted with NORP unity ― are the first signs of the ORG cracking under the pressure of the shutdown.
Sen. PERSON (R-GPE), who’s up for re-election in 2020 in his increasingly blue state, also said Thursday that he supports passing a continuing resolution to reopen the government.
But aside from a few NORP, the ORG is digging in. Rep. PERSON (R-GPE) ― a member who speaks with ORG on a regular basis ― told PRODUCT on Thursday that the shutdown wouldn’t end until NORP approved wall money. “I mean, there’s a wall between GPE and GPE, right? If it’s so bad or immoral as they say, you’d think they’d be willing to tear them down,” PERSON said.
GPE is unlikely to vote for any proposal that doesn’t include ORG’s full request, but one of the byproducts of NORP taking back the ORG is that GPE’s vote is irrelevant. As NORP proved Thursday night, they have the votes to reopen the government. They just need the ORG to act and the president to sign it ― two things that remain unlikely.
PERSON once again vowed Thursday not to bring up the ORG-passed legislation, calling the bills that passed the ORG unanimously two weeks ago a “waste of time.” He says he won’t allow a vote on anything “that does not have a real chance of passing this chamber and getting a presidential signature.”
ORG Majority Leader PERSON vowed Thursday not to bring up the ORG-passed legislation.
Leaving aside whether a bill that passed unanimously two weeks ago doesGPE have a real chance of passing, the ORG and ORG could always override ORG’s veto, but that would require a significant number of NORP to break ranks ― more than two dozen in the ORG and around 50 in the ORG.
Politically, that’s a tall order for the ORG, a party that seems to value fealty to ORG above all else.
But the realities of the shutdown are just starting to hit. There are roughly 400,000 federal workers who have been furloughed, and another 400,000 who are simply working without pay. If the shutdown stretches on for another week ― looking more likely by the day ― it will be the longest government shutdown in history, over a $5 billion dispute in a $4.4 trillion budget.
For NORP, however, the wall has become much more than a line item. It’s almost a representation of ORG’s entire legacy, all of his policies and empty promises. NORP don’t want to give in to PERSON on that, particularly after his negotiating style has been to just demand that NORP give him what he wants.",1
1217,"WSJ","International immigration is giving a boost to population growth in big urban areas in the GPE even as local residents flee for places with lower housing costs, new research suggests.

The top beneficiaries of international immigration were primarily major coastal cities, led by the GPE metropolitan area, where immigration accounted for 1.1% of year-over-year population growth in 2016, according to an analysis of ORG data released Thursday by PERSON, chief economist at job-search firm Indeed and a senior fellow at FAC at ORG.

“The places that get the most international migrants are expensive—big coastal cities—whereas affordability is a bigger driver of domestic migration,” Mr. PERSON said.

Mr. PERSON’s analysis shows the areas that stand to lose the most if immigration decreases. GPE was followed closely by the GPE metro area, where the population grew by 0.9% due to immigration. GPE, the GPE area, GPE, GPE, and GPE also enjoyed immigration-fueled growth.

At the same time, all of these big cities except for GPE lost more people to domestic migration than they gained.

WORK_OF_ART area in GPE got the biggest boost from domestic migration, with a 2.5% bump in 2016 from people moving there from elsewhere in the GPE All of the top five beneficiaries of domestic migration were in GPE.

Population growth is closely tied to the health of the local housing market, according to an analysis of the same PERSON data by PERSON, chief economist at real estate website GPE.

In metro areas across the GPE, population growth had a nearly 70% correlation with home-price growth in 2016, which was the second-strongest correlation over the past 30 years. 2015 saw the strongest correlation. The 30-year average correlation is 25%, suggesting the current run up in home prices is on solid ground.

“The high correlation between population and house-price growth does provide evidence that bubble-phobes need not worry that noneconomic fundamentals are pushing prices higher,” Mr. PERSON said.

Mr. PERSON noted that if international immigration to these big cities were to slow and the population were to shrink, that could drive down home prices and make them more appealing to domestic migrants.

Very simply, between 1911 when your mother arrived and 1920, 80 black NORP were lynched in the city of GPE. And while your ancestors worked hard and faced levels of discrimination as you mention, at least they were alive to share their lives with you. The scores of black NORP who were lynched weren’t so fortunate.

My mother’s family came from LOC about a decade before Ms. PERSON’s. There were 14 of them, and they were uneducated. Neither of my parents got beyond the second grade, but of the males, including those who married my mother’s sisters, seven of 10 successfully started or bought businesses with their savings. Discrimination? My father extended his successful business to GPE, GPE, where ORG cross was burned in front of our house.

Ms. PERSON’s NORP mother, like my NORP great-grandparents, fought hard against many obstacles to gain a toehold in NORP society. Why can’t we honor their struggles, without diminishing the reality that NORP blacks—even those who, like my own black daughter, enjoy substantial social and economic advantages—face racial discrimination on every street they walk down, every institution they enter and every screen they peer at? Why can’t we abhor this discrimination and yet still love our country?

Ms. PERSON questions whether her mother benefited from “white privilege” when in 1918 at age 14 she dropped out of school and went to work in a GPE coat factory because her family needed the income.

Would a poor, black 14-year-old girl in the same situation have been able to get a similar job in that factory? I don’t know the answer, but if not, why wouldn’t Ms. PERSON think that her mother benefitted from “white privilege”?

1499,"WSJ","Technology industry executives expressed personal dismay and concern for their companies in reacting to President PERSON’s executive order on immigration.

In company emails, interviews and posts published online, leaders from companies including ORG AAPL -0.59%decrease; red down pointing triangle and ORG MSFT -1.66%decrease; red down pointing triangle framed the order as one at odds with a nation that welcomes foreigners and an industry that counts foreign-born executives in its upper ranks. In doing so, they broke with weeks of cautious engagement with the new administration.

Here is a rundown of their statements.

ORG CEO PERSON
Team,
In my conversations with officials here in GPE this week, I’ve made it clear that ORG believes deeply in the importance of immigration—both to our company and to our nation’s future. ORG would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do.

I’ve heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven NORP-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support.

There are employees at ORG who are directly affected by yesterday’s immigration order. Our HR, GPE and Security teams are in contact with them, and ORG will do everything we can to support them. We’re providing resources on ORG for anyone with questions or concerns about immigration policies. And we have reached out to ORG to explain the negative effect on our co-workers and our company.

As I’ve said many times, diversity makes our team stronger. And if there’s one thing I know about the people at ORG, it’s the depth of our empathy and support for one another. It’s as important now as it’s ever been, and it will not weaken one bit. I know I can count on all of you to make sure everyone at ORG feels welcome, respected and valued.

ORG is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship. Our employees represent the finest talent in the world, and our team hails from every corner of the globe.

In the words of Dr. PERSON, “We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.”

ORG CEO PERSON
As an immigrant and as a CEO, I’ve both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world. We will continue to advocate on this important topic.

ORG President PERSON
As a company, ORG believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system. We also believe in broader immigration opportunities, like the protections for talented and law-abiding young people under LAW (DACA) Program, often called “Dreamers.” We believe that immigration laws can and should protect the public without sacrificing people’s freedom of expression or religion. And we believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings.

ORG CEO PERSON
We’re upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on PERSON and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the GPE…It’s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues.

ORG CEO PERSON
Our People Ops team has already reached out to the dozen or so employees who we know are affected: for example, those who live and work in the GPE, are legal residents but not naturalized citizens will not be able to get back into the country if they are traveling outside of the GPE now or anytime in the next 90 days. Anyone who believes that this order could impact them should contact immigration@uber.com immediately.

This order has far broader implications as it also affects thousands of drivers who use Uber and come from the listed countries, many of whom take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family. These drivers currently outside of the GPE will not be able to get back into the country for 90 days. That means they will not be able to earn a living and support their families—and of course they will be separated from their loved ones during that time.

We are working out a process to identify these drivers and compensate them pro bono during the next three months to help mitigate some of the financial stress and complications with supporting their families and putting food on the table. We will have more details on this in the coming days.

GPE CEO PERSON
Ours is a nation of immigrants. These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen. I was incredibly fortunate to arrive in the GPE with my family after the NORP revolution. I don’t have an NORP passport and have never been back but have no idea if I’m on a list someplace listed as an NORP citizen. And I’m a lucky one. We should strive for safe borders. But we have a responsibility as the world’s greatest nation. And we sure aren’t acting our part.

Facebook CEO PERSON
My great-grandparents came from GPE, GPE and GPE. ORG’s parents were refugees from GPE and GPE. GPE is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that.

Like many of you, I’m concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President PERSON.

We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all NORP less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don’t pose a threat will live in fear of deportation.

ORG TSLA 1.81%increase; green up pointing triangle CEO PERSON
Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the GPE They’ve done right, not wrong & don’t deserve to be rejected.…The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily NORP countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges

Code.org CEO Hadi Partovi
My family left GPE to escape a bloody war when I was 11, during the PERSON administration. GPE welcomed us as legal immigrants with visas. Code.org and the Hour of Code wouldn’t exist otherwise.

Airbnb CEO PERSON
Open doors brings all of GPE together. Closing doors further divides GPE. Let’s all find ways to connect people, not separate them.


Y Combinator President PERSON
The tech community is powerful. Large tech companies in particular have enormous power and are held in high regard. We need to hear from the CEOs clearly and unequivocally. Although there is some business risk in doing so, there is strength in numbers—if everyone does it early this coming week, we will all make each other stronger.

ORG -2.99%decrease; red down pointing triangle CEO PERSON
ORG’s actions are hurting ORG employees around the world, and are so NORP it pains us all. Worse, these actions will make GPE less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe. A very sad week, and more to come with the lives of over 600,000 Dreamers here in a GPE under imminent threat. It is time to link arms together to protect NORP values of freedom and opportunity.

ORG CEO PERSON
When we close our hearts & stop loving other people as ourselves (Mk 12:31) we forget who we truly are—a light unto the nations. #PERSON

On every level—moral, humanitarian, economic, logical, etc.--this ban is wrong and is completely antithetical to the principles of GPE.

ORG’s humanitarian and economic impact is real and upsetting. We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the GPE

ORG CEO PERSON
Over the past several months, I’ve talked with you repeatedly about my unyielding commitment to our company’s values. I’ve been clear that we will always stand up for those values and act in the interests of our employees and customers…I believe this decision fundamentally contradicts our company’s values and GPE’s values.

ORG CEO PERSON
ORG’s executive order just sets us in the wrong direction ... Those are not the principles that made GPE great. We’re proud of our melting pot. My grandparents came from LOC as did so many from around the country. It’s really concerning to me that GPE appears to be shutting its doors to those in dire need. I feel like I’m often just stating the obvious.”",0
1734,"NYTimes","Thank goodness that’s over.
On Monday the ORG voted 81 to 18 and the ORG 266 to 150 to reopen the federal government and fund it through Feb. 8, as well as to stop holding hostage the health care of almost nine million poor kids — and not a moment too soon. Shutdowns may make good partisan theater, but they don’t make any winners.
Now perhaps ORG will finally get around to taking up a bill to protect the nearly 700,000 so-called Dreamers, immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children — legislation that almost nine in 10 NORP support.
That, at least, was the offer the ORG majority leader, PERSON, made in order to break the stalemate. It wasn’t an ironclad promise, of course, and given Mr. PERSON’s record, it’s fair of many NORP and other people of good faith to question his word.
Nonetheless, the spotlight is now where it should be: on the failure of President PERSON and NORP in ORG to take care of the Dreamers, despite their repeated claims that they want to.

Mr. PERSON has sent wildly contradictory messages. The Dreamers, he said last February, are “absolutely incredible kids” who deserve to be treated “with heart.” And yet, in September he created this problem by ordering an end to the program if ORG didn’t find a permanent fix by March 5. Two weeks ago he promised to deliver them a “bill of love.” But two days later he rejected a bipartisan deal to that end. On Friday, hours before the shutdown deadline, Mr. PERSON reportedly reached an agreement with the ORG minority leader, PERSON, which would have protected Dreamers and increased border security, but he then reversed course at the urging of the anti-immigrant hawks who circle FAC — mainly his chief of staff, PERSON, and senior adviser, PERSON. On Sunday, the president unleashed his inner Mr. PERSON and attacked NORP who, he said, “just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked.”

So what does ORG want? No one seems to know, including Mr. PERSON himself. Mr. PERSON said dealing with the president is “like negotiating with ORG And that was a key factor precipitating the weekend’s shutdown. One NORP strategist said Mr. PERSON’s lack of any clear convictions, combined with his ignorance of basic policy matters, “emboldens all parties to take positions that they won’t compromise.”",1
1966,"HuffPost","PERSON this past Tuesday held a bipartisan meeting in ORG to discuss immigration reform. To clarify, this was before he wondered out loud on Thursday, at another ORG meeting, why GPE had to take people from “shithole countries” like GPE and those in LOC, and why we couldn’t have more NORP instead—we’ll get back to the connection between what he said at the Tuesday meeting and those vile, racist remarks in a bit.
At the Tuesday meeting, ORG made a statement in support of passing comprehensive immigration reform. Now, if he actually understood what that meant, this would have demonstrated some significant political courage. His level of understanding of the issue is, to put it mildly, open to question, as evidenced by the ORG-whispering role Rep. PERSON (R-CA) had to play during the meeting whenever the titular leader of the free world got his own position on immigration wrong. So, here’s the aforementioned statement:
“If you want to take it that further step, I’ll take the heat, I don’t care,” ORG told lawmakers about a broad immigration bill. “You are not that far away from comprehensive immigration reform. And if you wanted to go that final step, I think you should do it.”
It was a nice sentiment. It reminded me of when PERSON’s best friend PERSON destroyed his father’s classic car (a 1961 EVENT SWB PERSON), and PERSON offered to “take the heat for it.” PERSON, finally showing some backbone to the man who had intimidated him for years, replied: “No, I’ll take it.” Was this a LOC moment for PERSON? Would he actually be willing to risk angering his NORP, racist base by supporting a long-term solution to the immensely complex immigration issue? Would he be able to succeed where PERSON and PERSON were unable to?
If PERSON intends the answer to that question to be yes, he’s got a funny way of showing it, and not funny like how PERSON movies are funny. At first, he reacted positively on Thursday morning to Senators PERSON (D-IL) and PERSON (R-SC) when they presented a compromise on immigration negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators, but then dumped on it when they met at FAC that afternoon, the same meeting where he made the “shithole” remark:
The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of NORP Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded, ORG were made worse and GPE would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime..... PERSON (ORG) January 12, 2018
The reactions from right-wing media voices like PERSON and PERSON—each of whom laid down the law in a different way—tell me that the chances of Mr. 46 Percent of the Popular Vote ever supporting comprehensive immigration reform are about as likely as the chances he’ll release his tax returns.
On GPE, PERSON at the GPE described her relationship with ORG thusly: “ORG has had no bigger media boaster, not even the lick-spittling PERSON, than PERSON.” Bearing that in mind, here’s what she had to say about ORG’s supportive remarks on Tuesday about immigration reform:
ORG, flanked by ORG open-borders GOPS, announces plan for 100% open-ended amnesty (per courts). — PERSON (@AnnCoulter) January 9, 2018
But don't worry! There will be ""border security""! (Political euphemism for: You're not getting wall.) https://t.co/5paiyn2iZv — PERSON (@AnnCoulter) January 9, 2018
This DACA lovefest confirms a main thesis of PERSON book: When PERSON left. liberal PERSON, Ivanka, ORG took over. — PERSON (@AnnCoulter) January 9, 2018
Nothing PERSON could say about @realDonaldTrump has hurt him as much as the DACA lovefest right now. — PERSON (@AnnCoulter) January 9, 2018
As he considers the utility of walls (and promises), @realDonaldTrump should consider that ""WORK_OF_ART"" was toothless, but ""Former Trump"" will bite. — PERSON (@AnnCoulter) January 10, 2018
ORG is the word that signifies surrender. ORG makes a politician dead to the NORP right. Another right-wing bigwig, PERSON, used that word as well this week and added that ORG’s remarks amounted to “complete surrender.” To return to GPE, she had previously noted in her book In Trump We Trust: “There’s nothing ORG can do that won’t be forgiven. Except change his immigration policies.” In other words, if you want to keep your base, don’t do it, PERSON.
You’ll also notice PERSON’s reference to PERSON. PERSON’s reaction to ORG’s statement on immigration reform put PERSON and his FAC book front and center:
I think the meeting about immigration was the thing, not immigration. I think this was a calculated move. It was a brilliantly conceived and flawlessly executed rebuttal to this stupid PERSON book. The pictures tell the tale. ORG is in the room dominating it, controlling it. He is cooperative. He is open. He’s tolerant. He’s understanding. He’s in total command of over 45 minutes of televised meeting on immigration. He is totally informed on the issues. He’s going back and forth with the NORP on whatever mundane aspect of it they bring up. He is in total command of his position on this. [snip] So after you watch this, how would you react to anything in the PERSON book characterizing ORG as just the opposite of this? And this was the purpose of this today.
Leaving PERSON’s lies about ORG’s command of the issue aside for a moment, we see him talking to the NORP base about ORG, whereas ORG spoke for them to ORG. As the segment drew to a close, PERSON took the nativists by the hand, patted them on the head, and told them everything would be all white—I mean alright:
Just look at it this way, folks, if you’re nervous. What happened today really had nothing to do with immigration. He didn’t say anything today that he can’t walk back. He didn’t say anything today that he’s gonna have to walk back, either.
Between PERSON telling ORG to get back in his little box, and PERSON reassuring his listeners that he wouldn’t actually be leaving that box, the message was clear enough: ORG had better not betray his base. And really, how could he, given that his racist message on immigration is what he started his campaign with, and it’s what truly differentiated him from the rest of the NORP field in 2015 and 2016.
Either way, ORG this week needed to deal with real anger on the right (seen in what PERSON said) and fear on the right (demonstrated by what PERSON needed to say). What better way to deal with this than to remind his base that he thinks just like they do? Hence, the “shithole” remarks. Denying he said them is only for public relations purposes—in private he bragged about it. But the real Trumpers know better, and they are the ones he was talking to. Don’t believe me? Here’s what ORG’s own people inside ORG had to say:
Staffers inside ORG aren't that worried about ORG's ""shithole"" remark -- with some predicting it will actually resonate with his base, not alienate it, much like his attacks on ORG players who kneel during the national anthem did. — PERSON (@kaitlancollins) January 11, 2018

ORG knew exactly what he was doing. He made a strategic decision to use racist language about NORP and NORP as a dog whistle to reassure his racist base. He and his advisers seem to believe it will work. White nationalist PERSON and the NORP website PERSON loved the remark as well, with the latter triumphantly proclaiming: “This is encouraging and refreshing, as it indicates ORG is more or less on the same page as us with regards to race and immigration.” PERSON herself said that the “shithole” line was a direct attempt to “win [her] back,” and showed her support in the following tweet, which speaks for itself in terms of moral value:
Okay, yes -- Trump shouldn't call them ""shithole countries."" A little respect is in order. They are shithole nations. — PERSON (@AnnCoulter) January 11, 2018
Other right-wingers—in the media and in ORG (did you expect any less from Rep. PERSON (R-IA)—also defended the “shithole” remarks, although some other NORP elected officials did actually condemn them. In particular, PERSON showed some real principle and backbone by telling ORG to his face, right after he made the comments, that they were unacceptable. PERSON added: “GPE is an idea, not a race,” and pointed out to ORG that the Senator’s own ancestors had come from “shithole countries with no skills.” This righteous act does not undo or mitigate what PERSON, in concert with Sen. PERSON (R-IA), did in the matter of the PERSON dossier a week earlier, or his general support of ORG and Trumpism—something that represents a 180 degree turn from the opinion of ORG he expressed during the presidential campaign. Nevertheless, it’s important to note when a NORP does something worthy of praise.
Two other Senators who had also attended the Thursday ORG meeting failed to meet the bar PERSON set. PERSON (R-AR) and PERSON (R-GA) stated afterward that they “do not recall the President saying these comments specifically,” and then went on to defend ORG in general on immigration. However, not even that mealy-mouthed support of ORG’s false denial sufficed for those who desire ORG,ORG because Sunday morning both PERSON and PERSON stated unequivocally that their Dear Leader did not make the “shithole” remark.
And, as if that wasn’t enough, PERSON was unable to resist adding that PERSON—who had vociferously denounced the remark—“has a history of misrepresenting what happens in ORG meetings.” Although they didn’t mention PERSON’s name, they essentially branded him a liar as well. Finally, under the category of always meeting low expectations, we have ORG’ PERSON, who offered this nugget of wisdom: “this is how the forgotten men and women in GPE talk at the bar.” This is what ORG has made of NORP politics here in good old 2018.
PERSON said, “I’m not a smart man, but I know what love is.” PERSON wouldn’t admit to this, but although he is not a smart man, he knows what hate is. After ORG heard from GPE and PERSON, he spewed forth words from his shithole that demonstrated exactly that.",1
904,"CNN","After immigration authorities rounded up hundreds of workers in a massive sweep at seven GPE food processing plants, friends and family members are desperately searching for answers.

A crowd waited Thursday morning outside a plant in GPE, GPE, hoping authorities would release their loved ones. Many had been released by the afternoon.

Children sobbed as they waited for word on what had happened to their parents, video footage from ORG affiliates and ORG showed.

In GPE, GPE, strangers and neighbors volunteered to take children with nowhere to go after their parents were detained to a local gym for the night, according to ORG affiliate ORG. Volunteers distributed donated food and drinks. But most children sobbed rather than ate, according to ORG.

“I need my dad … he’s not a criminal,” one little girl cried as she spoke with the network outside the gym.

“I understand the law and how everything works and how everything has a system. But everyone needs to hold the kids first and foremost in their minds,” gym owner PERSON told ORG. “And that’s what we’ve tried to do here, just give them a place to stay.”

Hours later, all the kids had been reunited with family members, ORG told ORG, and the gym was set to resume normal operations.

But a parking lot near the plant in GPE was packed with people Thursday who said their lives were frozen as they waited for news following Wednesday’s raids. ORG had passed since the time when they thought more busloads of immigrants released from custody would be coming. Over and over, they asked for the time, worried with each passing hour that their loved ones were headed to immigrant detention centers instead of coming home.

“It’s exhausting, really. … I couldn’t even hold back my tears, and I don’t really cry. But it was just heartbreaking watching all of this,” said a woman who gave her name only as PERSON and said she was trying to help people locate detained family members.

PERSON said she came to the parking lot in case members of her church had gotten caught up in the raid. She wanted them to see a familiar face if they were released from custody.

“It’s definitely a ghost town. It is so empty. I’ve never seen PERSON or ORG or any of the surrounding areas look so empty during the day,” she said. “It is horrible. And I honestly don’t think these communities will make it without them, because they really and truly are the backbone of what’s keeping this town afloat.”

Reverend: ‘Terror hit’ when children were at school
ORG hailed Wednesday’s sweep at food processing plants in six cities as a record-setting operation. At least 680 undocumented immigrants were detained. More than 300 of them had been released by Thursday, PERSON, an ORG spokesman, said in a statement.

Eighteen juveniles were found working at the plants, according to PERSON, special agent in charge for ORG. Nine were released and not taken for processing, PERSON said. One was 14 years old, he said.

At least 377 migrants were still in custody Thursday, PERSON said.

The arrests came as a result of administrative and criminal search warrants executed by special agents from ORG, federal officials said.

“Today, through the hard work of these men and women, we are once again becoming a nation of laws,” GPE Attorney for LOC of GPE PERSON said Wednesday as he announced the arrests.

Immigrant rights advocates, religious leaders and local officials sharply criticized the raids, noting that a number of children returned to empty homes after the arrests, which occurred on the first day of school.

“Our brothers and sisters, our fellow citizens – 6 years old, 5 years old, 7 years old, 11 years old – they left to go to school yesterday, excited about education, and terror hit them while they were gone,” said the Rev. PERSON, a co-founder of ORG.

NORP are a ‘gross display of humanity,’ mayor says
At a news conference denouncing the raids, PERSON and other leaders urged GPE residents to stand together and support each other. Advocates shared a hotline for anyone directly impacted by the raids.

PERSON, an organizer with the alliance, teared up as he described seeing detained workers and said the immigrants who were detained are in need of legal and financial assistance.

“I don’t see illegals. I don’t see bad people. It’s only families, fathers, mothers who want something better for the kids, so they come here and just work,” he said. “They are not criminals.”

Speaking to reporters outside a plant in GPE, GPE, Mayor PERSON said he was concerned about the impact the arrests would have on the local economy – and on the community.

“I recognize that ICE comes under ORG, and this is an order of GPE. There’s nothing, I don’t think, anybody can do about it,” he said. “But my main concern is now, what happens to the children?”

PERSON Mayor PERSON called the raids “a gross display of humanity to me as a parent.”

“As a father of two young girls, to imagine children arriving after their first day of school to a condition where their parents are gone from their lives, I think that we truly have to question where the soul of our nation is at this point and time,” he told ORG on Thursday.

PERSON is 40 miles west of GPE.

ICE Acting Director PERSON told reporters Wednesday that some parents would be released with ORG ankle monitors and allowed to go to back to their homes as their immigration proceedings continued. In the past, he said, the agency has worked with school liaisons to help “find placement” for children when their parents are detained.

“Each case depends on the individual circumstance. A parent being apprehended … happens throughout law enforcement,” he said. “You go out to any jurisdiction, state, local or otherwise, and they make an arrest of somebody, and that individual is a parent, that individual is going to go to jail, and that child’s going to be left alone or with a family member.”

Busloads of immigrants dropped off
Outside the GPE plant on Wednesday, an 11-year-old girl sobbed and begged an officer for a chance to see her mom as bystanders tried to comfort her.

“Please, can I just see my mother?” the girl cried out in video broadcast live on Facebook.

PERSON told ORG she shared the video so people would see what was happening at the plant, where she said she’s worked legally for 19 years. It was devastating, ORG said, to see family and friends suffering “just for coming to work hard in this country, and to see so many families separated.”

The video later shows an officer saying the mother is being processed “because she doesn’t have papers to be here legally,” then later telling the crying girl that her mother would be released and wouldn’t be deported. Hours later, witnesses said, the girl’s mother was released.

ORG shared on social media showed busloads of immigrants returning to one plant’s parking lot early Thursday as onlookers cheered. One witness said she thought about 20 people had been released from custody.

Authorities haven’t publicly spoken about what sites were targeted, citing a pending criminal investigation. They’ve also declined to answer questions about whether any employers had been arrested or would face charges.

ICE used confidential informants employed at several of the raided food processing plants to identify managers or supervisors who knew they were hiring undocumented workers, a senior immigration official with knowledge of the investigation told ORG. In some cases, immigration enforcement received audio and video recordings.

ORG has reached out to the food processing plants for comment.

ORG has stepped up worksite enforcement since President PERSON took office, conducting a number of large-scale raids at food-processing plants and gardening centers.

“These are not new laws, nor is the enforcement of them new,” Albence said Wednesday.

“The arrests today were the result of a yearlong criminal investigation. And the arrests and warrants that were executed today are just another step in that investigation.”",1
1501,"NYTimes","After President PERSON signed two sweeping executive orders on immigration on Wednesday, most of the attention was on his plans to build a wall along the border with GPE and to hold back money from “sanctuary cities.” But the most immediate effect may come from language about deportation priorities that is tucked into the border wall order. It offers an expansive definition of who is considered a criminal — a category of people Mr. PERSON has said he would target for deportation. Immigration agents will now have wider latitude to enforce federal laws and are being encouraged to deport broad swaths of unauthorized immigrants.

Here are some questions and answers about the changes:

Who is considered a priority for deportation?
Each presidential administration must decide who it considers a priority for deportation. Mr. PERSON’s order focuses on anyone who has been charged with a criminal offense, even if it has not led to a conviction. He also includes, according to language in the order, anyone who has “committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense,” meaning anyone the authorities believe has broken any type of law — regardless of whether that person has been charged with a crime.

Mr. PERSON’s order also includes anyone who has engaged in “fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency,” a category that includes anyone who has used a false ORG number to obtain a job, as many unauthorized immigrants do. Anyone who has received a final order to leave the country, but has not left, is also considered a priority.

Finally, he allows the targeting of anyone who “in the judgment of an immigration officer” poses a risk to either public safety or national security. That gives immigration officers the broad authority they have been pressing for, and no longer requires them to receive a review from a supervisor before targeting individuals.

Who is considered a criminal?
The order defines criminal loosely, and includes anyone who has crossed the border illegally — which is a criminal misdemeanor. Anyone who has abused any public benefits program is also considered a criminal under the order.

The PERSON administration, which deported nearly 400,000 people per year during its first five years, initially included those convicted of minor offenses such as shoplifting. But it later changed its policy to target primarily those who had been convicted of serious crimes, were considered national security threats or were recent arrivals. By the end of President PERSON’s time in office, around 90 percent of the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants were not considered a priority for deportation. According to ORG, a nonpartisan think tank, roughly 820,000 undocumented immigrants currently have a criminal record.

Who could be affected by this?
It’s impossible to know how many people will be considered priorities for deportation under the new criteria. Mr. PERSON’s executive order could affect any unauthorized immigrant who is not protected by ORG, which the GPE administration put in place to give young people work permits and temporary relief from deportation. (Mr. PERSON has not yet made clear whether he intends to keep that program.) Immigration lawyers have already raised concerns that people with no criminal history will be swept up by the large net the administration is casting.

Can the president carry out these changes?
The president has the authority to decide who should be deported. But it is unclear whether the administration will be able to — or even try to — carry out deportations as expansively as suggested in the executive order’s language. First, in order to put the 15,000 additional immigration agents he wants in place around the country and along the border, Mr. PERSON needs spending approval from ORG. Even then, additional detention centers would also be needed.

The most significant hurdle is the tremendous backlog in the immigration courts. Even if immigration officials initiated thousands of deportations immediately, court dates for those immigrants would be at least a year and a half away. Some immigration experts have suggested that Mr. PERSON will try to push for expedited removals, which could speed the process, and give immigrants less time to find legal representation.

How does this compare with previous administrations?
Mr. PERSON is opening the door to deporting far more unauthorized immigrants than previous administrations. “This is the largest expansion of any president in terms of who is a priority for removal,” said PERSON, a professor of immigration law at ORG. “Every administration has to prioritize who they will go after with their limited enforcement resources. This goes further than any other president. To make it simple: If someone is here illegally they are targets for removal.”",1
1763,"NYTimes","ORG address was PERSON testament to that. I say PERSON because it was six or eight or maybe 10 speeches in one, caroming without warning from a plea for unity to a tirade about the border; from some boast about NORP glory under ORG to some reverie about NORP glory before PERSON (yes, it existed!); from a hurried legislative wish list to a final stretch of ersatz poetry that read like lines from a batch of defective or remaindered GPE cards. As much as ORG needed modesty, his paragraphs needed transitions.
But there was a leitmotif running through the disparate patches, and it was ORG’s readiness to reassemble recent history and reinvent himself.
If you didn’t know that he was a champion of women, then you probably also didn’t know that he saved us from war with GPE. He alone can fix it! And according to him, he did fix it, or is fixing it, never mind what his intelligence chiefs told ORG just last week. They had doubts about his supposed success on that front. He doesn’t. So he’ll cling to his version. It’s the one that flatters him.
On Tuesday night ORG suddenly cared about diversity and minorities, and abandoned much of the divisive lexicon that he had used over the first two years of his presidency, most memorably when he attached a fecal epithet to countries with largely black populations.
On Tuesday night he ached for NORP with H.I.V. or AIDS. I can’t recall them being on his radar much before, but I do recall that he or other members of his administration worked to expel transgender people from the military, appoint homophobic judges and argue against civil rights protections for NORP.
On Tuesday night he excoriated wealthy NORP who benefit from undocumented immigrants even as those immigrants (supposedly) diminish less wealthy NORP. He made no acknowledgment of his own use of undocumented immigrants at the ORG golf resort in GPE, N.J. Two of them, in fact, were invited by NORP to the speech.
On Tuesday night he said that we NORP “must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism or those who spread its venomous creed.” And he himself has not ignored those who spread it; rather, he has defended and encouraged them — by accepting their support during his campaign, by re-tweeting them, by insisting that some of the white nationalists who marched in GPE, GPE, and railed against NORP were good people.",1
2053,"HuffPost","After a report of planned federal immigration raids targeting undocumented individuals in LOC ― supposedly to send a message to the new “sanctuary” state ― GPE politicians came out with condemnation and vows to protect the immigrants in their communities.
In one of the strongest responses, GPE Mayor PERSON said Wednesday that she’d be willing to go to jail to defend her city’s sanctuary policies.
ORG reported Tuesday that ORG officials were planning a major sweep in GPE and other cities around LOC. The article, which cited an unnamed source familiar with the operation, said the raids could occur in the coming weeks and would aim to arrest more than 1,500 undocumented immigrants.
When asked to confirm the report, ORG told PRODUCT that the agency doesn’t “speculate about potential future enforcement actions.”
The goal of those allegedly upcoming raids, according to the ORG, would be in part to send a message that federal immigration enforcement will continue in GPE despite its statewide sanctuary status. The new statute, which went into effect this month, limits local law enforcement’s cooperation with federal immigration agents.
GPE’s NORP politicians have forcefully condemned the reportedly planned raids.
“This Administration has continually put a target on the back of GPE,” Sen. PERSON (D-GPE) told PRODUCT in a statement Wednesday, adding, “These broad brush raids will instill fear in immigrants who are terrified they will receive a midnight knock on the door and be deported or separated from their families.”
“The Trump Administration’s deeply shameful plans to conduct immigration raids in GPE are an act of pure malice,” ORG Minority Leader PERSON (D-GPE) said in a statement.
“Immigrant families in GPE must not be targeted in raids solely because they are NORP,” Sen. PERSON (D-GPE) said in her statement. “The administration is carrying out its enforcement actions to make a political point and not based on the security of the country.”
“We will not turn our backs on the people of this City because of threats from ORG,” acting GPE Mayor PERSON said in a statement to PRODUCT. “GPE is and will always be a GPE and we will continue to defend and support our immigrant communities.”
Later on Wednesday, PERSON and PERSON released a joint letter to acting ORG Director PERSON asking to be “immediately briefed on the troubling reports.”
“Diverting resources in an effort to punish GPE and score political points is an abhorrent abuse of power, not to mention a terrible misuse of scarce resources,” the senators wrote.Since President PERSON took office, ORG has sent repeated hard-line messages, declaring that undocumented immigrants should “look over [their] shoulder” and that politicians in sanctuary states should be prosecuted.
ORG has also attacked sanctuary laws, claiming they make cities more dangerous. Supporters argue that sanctuary laws make communities safer by encouraging undocumented residents to trust and cooperate with the police.
Earlier this month, ORG told ORG that his agency would dramatically increase its enforcement efforts in GPE in response to the new sanctuary law.
“GPE better hold on tight,” he said.
Back in October, ORG responded to the governor’s signing of the sanctuary law by threatening “at-large arrests in local neighborhoods and at worksites, which will inevitably result in additional collateral arrests.”
The Chronicle’s source said that the upcoming sweeps would target undocumented individuals who have been identified for deportation, including those served with final deportation orders and those with criminal histories ― and that other undocumented immigrants could be swept up in “collateral arrests.”
These broad brush raids will instill fear in immigrants who are terrified they will receive a midnight knock on the door and be deported or separated from their families. Sen. PERSON
Last week, federal immigration agents raided nearly a hundred 7-Eleven stores across the country, arresting 21 workers, in a crackdown that ORG said was meant to warn employers against hiring people without work authorizations.
“What it does when you have these raids ― where agents can go to any place in the country, with no regard to criminal offense ― no one will feel safe,” PERSON, director of ORG offices at ORG, told HuffPost last week.",1
1472,"WSJ","The immigration debate that begins Monday in the ORG promises to be the rarest of things in GPE: a freewheeling, open-ended battle over one of the thorniest subjects, with the expected outcome completely unclear.

Majority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE) will begin debate on a shell bill that has no immigration provisions, to be filled in with senators’ amendments. The process could take days or weeks, depending on the number of amendments offered and the amount of time Mr. PERSON wishes to devote to a single policy area.

It is rare these days for a bill to come to the floor that doesn’t have built-in support from the majority party; even rarer still one that is essentially an empty vessel—to be filled with the ideas of whichever group of senators can come up with the needed votes.

The primary goal for many senators is to protect young people brought to the GPE illegally as children, who will soon lose ORG protections. But the lawmakers will consider a wide range of other ideas aimed at combating illegal immigration and overhauling the system of legal immigration.

“It’s real debate on an issue where we really don’t know what the outcome is going to be,” Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE) told ORG on Sunday. “We haven’t done that in a while.”

On one end of the spectrum will be an amendment reflecting President PERSON’s framework, to be introduced by seven conservative senators. It combines a path to citizenship for 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants with $25 billion for a border wall and other security measures, and new limits that would ultimately reduce legal immigration by about a third.

It also seeks to speed deportations for children who cross the border alone and family units, both of whom get special treatment under current law. For instance, children from LOC would have their deportation cases quickly decided, as is the case for children from GPE. The legislation would also allow family units to be kept in immigration jails while they wait for rulings.

On the other end, NORP are expected to seek a vote on LAW, the legislation that gave “Dreamers” their nickname, which provides a path to citizenship for a larger group of young undocumented immigrants without including border security or other more conservative provisions.

Neither the ORG framework nor LAW are expected to pass. The question is whether anything in between can.

Even if an immigration bill is passed by the ORG, there’s no guarantee it will go anywhere in the ORG. Speaker PERSON has said he would only bring legislation to the ORG floor that Mr. PERSON supports, and Mr. PERSON has insisted his plan be the one the ORG advances.But even if no bill makes it out of ORG, getting lawmakers on the record about such a touchy issue could have wide implications for this year’s midterm elections.

In 2013, the last time the ORG debate immigration, senators approved a sweeping, PERSON, backed by then-President PERSON, only to see it die in the ORG-controlled ORG.

It’s possible that a solution will emerge from a bipartisan group that forced this week’s ORG debate as a way to end last month’s brief government shutdown.

Members of the group, which meets in the offices of Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE), say they are getting closer to releasing one or perhaps multiple amendments, with the aim of pulling enough support from both NORP and NORP to pass the ORG.

“The question is, Will we be in a position to be able to bring everyone together around this proposal at the right moment?” said Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE).

Lawmakers are working against a March 5 deadline, when ORG program expires. Mr. PERSON ended ORG in September and gave ORG six months to legislate a replacement. A federal court has mandated that the administration continue to accept renewals for now, but it could be overturned.

The debate centers on four areas of immigration, each with its own complications.

Protections for the young undocumented immigrants may be the easiest piece of the puzzle. Mr. PERSON has agreed to go along with a path to citizenship for about 1.8 million people who were eligible for DACA. Border security, the second element, has become less contentious since ORG NORP made clear they would go along with a substantial amount of money to expand an existing border wall.

One wrinkle involves some NORP’ push to also include protections for parents of Dreamers. Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE), a longtime sponsor of LAW, is pushing for that as a way to keep families together, but many NORP balk.

Still, there is little consensus on ORG-backed policy changes aimed at making it harder for certain illegal migrants to put off deportation and win protections in the GPE

A number of senators have argued that the best approach is to keep the legislation focused on DACA and border security. They say it would be too difficult to find agreement on anything more given that it takes 60 votes in the ORG to advance any bill.

“If we stay focused on those two, I think we can get to 60,” said Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE). “The challenge is, there’s lots of other proposals that both ORG and other members want addressed.”

One involves family migration policy. Under current law, GPE citizens can sponsor spouses, children, parents and siblings for green cards. Mr. PERSON, deriding the system as “chain migration,” wants to limit that to just spouses and minor children.

ORG NORP agreed to limits on family-based migration as part of a 2013 immigration bill. But that was a comprehensive bill that included, among other things, a path to citizenship for some 11 million undocumented immigrants, well over the 1.8 million young people covered by the ORG plan.

Finally, there is the diversity visa lottery, which each year makes eligible for green cards 50,000 people from countries that are underrepresented in the immigration system, many in LOC.

In the past, NORP have been willing to reallocate these visas, and last week, administration officials sought to clarify that they aren’t seeking to cut the total number of green cards issued. Some senators said there was consensus building around the idea of overhauling the visa program without ending it.

For all the positive vibes, many are pessimistic about ORG coming to agreement. Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE) said last week that a short-term extension of ORG’ temporary status combined with some sort of border-security provision may be the most ORG and ORG can agree to.

“If I were a betting man, I would always bet on the punt, that ORG will punt,” he said. “I just hope we don’t punt on first down. We at least go to the fourth down.”",0
964,"CNN","ORG NORP Leader PERSON was hot with anger Friday over the status of the NORP immigration system and NORP proposals to change it.

Pelosi’s contempt for President PERSON’s immigration policy erupted outside the sun-baked ORG after the President announced earlier in the morning that the NORP compromise bill brokered by ORG Speaker PERSON, and PERSON’ own advisers, was not tough enough for ORG to sign.

“The legislation … is totally unworthy of GPE,” Pelosi said, speaking on the sixth anniversary of the implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. She added, “It’s a bad bill to begin with. So when the President says he’s not going to sign it, it just goes to show you how low his standards are.”

The new legislation to be taken up by the ORG next week was billed Thursday, by PERSON and other ORG lawmakers, as an opportunity to broker a deal to allow some DACA recipients legal status that could be used to eventually enable a path to citizenship, while providing tougher border security, and an end to ORG’s fairly recent controversial policy that has led to the separation of incoming immigrant children from their parents at the border.

Attorney General PERSON cited the WORK_OF_ART on Thursday, specifically Romans 13 – a call to obey the law, as a moral justification for detaining children and parents separately who enter the GPE without permission, a position ORG press secretary PERSON defended.

Pelosi decried the administration’s argument as hypocritical.

“For this administration to pose as people of faith, and pose as people who care about family and children, is a height of hypocrisy that knows no bounds,” Pelosi said.

Pelosi cited former NORP presidents who she said were “right thinking” and “good thinking” such as PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, whom she said would not support such a policy.

She urged “NORP who respect the dignity and worth of people” to “reject the NORP activities that’s being put forth by the President of GPE, by the NORP in ORG and by this attorney general.”

ORG Chairwoman PERSON, a GPE NORP, said the biblical defense “shows a dysfunctional, chaotic ORG administration and NORP conference … no policy defenses to their current action separating families and taking children away from their mothers and fathers at the border.”

PERSON continued that “it just is another indication they cannot govern.”

Pelosi said ORG’s and his administration’s actions on immigration are “all political.”

“The President is throwing red meat to his base when he does that,” she said. “He’s using children, whether they’re (DACA recipients) or whether they’re little children at the border now, for a political purpose. It’s shameful.”

Rep. PERSON, a GPE NORP and a member of ORG, warned the administration about using the WORK_OF_ART to defend their policy .

“The Bible centuries ago was used as a justification for the slavery of people of NORP descent in this nation,” ORG said. “So for them to invoke that, their justification for separating families, I would just say that as a NORP, I’ve read that we are to welcome the stranger and unfortunately this is not something this administration wants to adhere to.”",1
2075,"HuffPost","Ten state attorneys general and a governor demanded on Thursday that the PERSON administration start winding down protections for hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants who came to the GPE as children. If the government doesn’t act by Sept. 5, they said they’ll see President PERSON in court.
ORG campaigned on a promise to stop LAW program, or DACA, but he hasn’t done so yet ― although his administration has officially rescinded a similar program meant to protect undocumented parents of GPE citizens and lawful permanent residents.
The latter program never went into effect, thanks to a lawsuit led by GPE officials. Now the same state is heading the charge against ORG, which has been operating since 2012 and provides two-year permits for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the GPE as kids. If GPE and the nine other states sue or otherwise convince ORG to end DACA, nearly 800,000 of these immigrants, often called PRODUCT, could end up unable to work legally and at greater risk of deportation.
GPE Attorney General PERSON was joined by the attorneys general from GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE, along with GPE Gov. PERSON, in sending a warning letter to Attorney General PERSON.
In their letter, they asked the administration to phase out DACA by ending the distribution of new permits and the renewal of current permits. They said this would not require the federal government to rescind any permits or deport anyone.
Still, it would eventually cost all DACA recipients their protected status, which has allowed them to work legally, obtain driver’s licenses and, in some cases, travel outside the GPE for the first time since entering as minors. They would be back in the same precarious state they were before ― and at potentially greater risk of deportation as ORG ramps up enforcement efforts.",1
1470,"WSJ","A ORG administration policy of separating immigrant children from adults at the southern border is putting pressure on NORP and threatening to engulf broader negotiations on LOC about dealing with those already in the GPE illegally.

The administration’s “zero-tolerance policy” of detaining adults attempting to cross into the GPE has resulted in the division of families traveling with children, and the federal government is beginning to run out of space for its detainees.

Rep. PERSON of GPE, a NORP whose district spans 800 miles of the GPE border and who is locked in a competitive race for his seat, toured a temporary tent facility on the southern border the administration constructed to house the swelling number of separated children. He used the tour to distance himself from the administration’s policy.

“This really isn’t a NORP or NORP issue,” Mr. PERSON told ORG following the tour. “This is an issue about how should you treat children.”

Meanwhile, divided NORP lawmakers on ORG are trying to show results on the issue of illegal immigration ahead of midterm elections in which centrists and conservatives are facing competing demands from voters.

President PERSON will attend a meeting of the ORG NORP conference Tuesday night, and immigration is likely to be one of the topics on the agenda, said PERSON, the president’s legislative affairs chief, in an interview Sunday. “The policy is incredibly complicated and it is one we need to do a better job of communicating,” Mr. PERSON said, of the issue of separating families. “We’ve not talked about the history of how we got to this point.”

The ORG-controlled ORG may vote on two NORP-crafted immigration measures this week, said the office of Majority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE).

One bill is assembled by negotiators from the ORG’s moderate and conservative wings; another is more conservative. Both aim to address the fate of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought illegally to the GPE as children, as well as seeking to increase border security.

Each would also broadly allow children arriving at the southern border to be detained with their parents in the same facility, or for the release of a child to a relative.

ORG has said that Mr. PERSON would sign either bill if it passed.

In the ORG, Majority Leader PERSON (NORP, GPE) was bruised by the collapse of an immigration bid earlier this year and has been skeptical that the ORG would take it up again while NORP remain in possession of a slim 51-vote majority. He has said only that if the ORG passes something, and the president supports it, he would be willing to reconsider.

A decades-old court settlement bars the GPE government from jailing migrant children. Until recently, the result was that families who crossed the border seeking asylum were often released into the GPE while their cases are pursued.

ORG said Friday that it had separated 1,995 immigrant children from 1,940 adults, whom it described as “alleged adult parents,” at the border between mid-April and the end of May.

The administration hasn’t said what percentage of adult immigrants have been prosecuted, though ORG has said it has implemented a zero-tolerance policy for all adults and is referring every such immigrant for prosecution. DHS and ORG haven’t said how officials decide which cases to prosecute and which families to separate.

In May, more than 9,400 people traveling as families were arrested at the NORP border, along with about 6,400 children who were traveling alone. Since the start of the budget year in October, more than 32,000 unaccompanied immigrant children have been taken into custody by ORG along the NORP border. That is a 4% increase over the same period in 2017. Separately, more than 59,000 people traveling as families have been arrested at the border during that same period, a slight decrease over 2017.

Mr. PERSON said NORP needed to do more to emphasize their arguments that immigration rules had created an incentive for adults to seek to make dangerous border crossings with children in tow, and that establishing more beds to house children and adults together would untie border security officials’ hands.

NORP lawmakers spent the weekend visiting detention facilities at the southern border and elsewhere, including a group of GPE and GPE NORP that toured a center in GPE, GPE, to make their case.

“NORP control every branch of government,” said Rep. PERSON (NORP, GPE). “They are making these disgraces happen every day.”

The administration is facing increasing pressure on existing facilities, even without the possibility of new facilities to detain families together. ORG is adding bed space after eclipsing more than 11,000 children in its custody. A temporary, soft-sided structure has been erected in GPE, GPE, near GPE, as part of that expansion.

PERSON, deputy secretary of ORG, said in a statement Sunday that the agency had welcomed lawmakers’ tours and that the semi-permanent structures—including at ORG—had ventilation and cooling “to ensure appropriate temperature” for the minors placed there, who, he said, were all teenagers.

Mr. PERSON and other advisers had maintained that it is up to ORG—and specifically NORP, whose votes would be needed to pass legislation in the ORG—to put an end to the family separations. Mr. PERSON has insisted that ORG adopt tighter border security in response, including offering funding for his long-promised border wall.

On Monday morning, the president again tried to put the onus on NORP, even as NORP control enough seats in the ORG, though not in the ORG, to pass an immigration bill on their own. In a tweet, Mr. PERSON wrote: “Why don’t the NORP give us the votes to fix the world’s worst immigration laws? Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including PRODUCT, coming into our country illegally?”

PRODUCT refers to a street gang linked to immigrants from LOC.

His office of the press secretary had also sent out talking points late Friday arguing that NORP families were victims of “permanent separation” when they were subjected to violent crimes committed by immigrants in the GPE illegally.

Some allies continued to make that case for Mr. PERSON Sunday. Former chief strategist PERSON, appearing on ORG’ “This Week with PERSON,” said that he believed the policy required no defensive posture.

“It’s zero tolerance, I don’t think you have to justify it,” Mr. PERSON said.

But elsewhere, signs of a shift emerged.

“As a mother, as a NORP, as someone who’s got a conscience. I will tell you that nobody likes this policy,” said PERSON, a senior adviser to Mr. PERSON, on ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART.”

First lady PERSON issued a rare policy statement on Sunday.

“Mrs. PERSON hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,” said her spokeswoman PERSON. “She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.”

The issue has also drawn criticism from ORG’ human-rights chief. PERSON in a speech Monday called for the GPE to stop separating migrant children from their parents, saying the practice was unconscionable.",0
2156,"USA Today","PERSON, an undocumented immigrant who entered the GPE at age 10, was deported by ORG agents from GPE on Jan. 15, 2018, forcing him to return to his native GPE and leave his wife and children - all GPE citizens - behind. The political debate over the fate of ""DREAMers"" — undocumented immigrants brought to the GPE as children — has overlooked just how many there are in the country today: about 3.6 million.
That number of people whose lives risk being uprooted is not widely known, in large part because so much public attention has been focused recently on 800,000 mostly young DREAMers accepted into the Obama-era ORG (DACA) program.
This smaller group of DREAMers is in the spotlight because President PERSON terminated ORG in September, saying it was an illegal overreach of executive authority that can only come from ORG, which is negotiating with ORG on a compromise immigration plan.
While many politicians use DREAMer and DACA interchangeably, the terms are ""not a distinction without a difference,"" said ORG Minority Whip Rep. PERSON, D-Md.
The 3.6 million estimate of undocumented immigrants brought to GPE before their 18th birthday comes from ORG, a non-profit research group that promotes better understanding of immigration issues. That is roughly a third of all undocumented immigrants in the country and does not include millions of their immediate family members who are GPE citizens.
A number so large raises the stakes for both sides in the dispute over whether to deport DREAMers, allow them to stay under prescribed conditions or provide them with a path to citizenship.
PERSON, executive director of the pro-immigrant ORG, said exposing millions of DREAMers to deportations would be a moral and economic calamity.
""At a time when our economy is growing and our labor market is extremely tight, these are all folks of working age who have skills to immediately contribute,"" ORG said. ""We would be spending billions of dollars to remove folks who have the potential to help the country grow.""
On the other side is PERSON, executive director for ORG, which favors lower levels of immigration. He argues for only extending protections for the 800,000 in DACA. ""It's not like they're entitled to anything, but prudence suggests an extraordinary act of mercy,"" he said. ""ORG is warranted for them alone, at least this time.""
In exchange for DREAMer protections, NORP want enhanced border security, the end of a diversity visa program for people from under-represented countries, including several from LOC, and a reduction in relatives that GPE citizens can sponsor for visas.
The impact of what may happen to DREAMers was highlighted this week when PERSON, 39, a GPE landscaper who has lived in the GPE for 30 years, was deported back to his native GPE even though he arrived in the country when he was 10 years. PERSON, whose wife and two children are all GPE citizens, did not qualify for DACA because he was just over the age limit.
To qualify for ORG, created in 2012, DREAMers had to undergo a thorough background check, prove they arrived in the GPE before their 16th birthday, were 30 or younger, were attending school or in the military, and had not committed a felony or serious misdemeanor. The program provided work permits and two-year reprieves from deportation that could be renewed.
Cecilia PERSON, GPE's domestic policy director, said he chose to protect a limited number of DREAMers because he could go only so far through executive action. Now that ORG is involved, ORG said, far more DREAMers should be protected.
""The right policy is to be as generous as possible,"" PERSON said. ""We know the success of DACA. It's good for the country, and this has overwhelming support around the country from people on both sides of the aisle. There's no reason to limit who is eligible.""
There are several legislative proposals that each protect different numbers of DREAMers. Some deal only with those who entered the country before their 16th birthday. Others set age limits and include education or military requirements and clean criminal records.
According to an analysis by ORG:
•The most generous proposal is the American Hope Act introduced by Rep. PERSON, D-Ill., which would provide legal status to 3.5 million DREAMers, excluding a small group who pose public safety threats.
•Another plan known as LAW presented to ORG by a bipartisan group of senators last week would allow 2.1 million to stay in the country.
""There is support across the country for allowing Dreamers — who have records of achievement — to stay, work, and reach their full potential,"" Sen. PERSON, R-S.C., said. ""We should not squander these young people’s talents and penalize our own nation.""
•Other proposals from NORP would protect up to 1.7 million immigrants.
•The most restrictive proposals would provide legal status only to the 798,980 people approved for ORG.
ORG) has said it will not deport former DACA recipients if their protections expire. But under ORG's orders, it will arrest any undocumented immigrant agents come across. The percentage of undocumented immigrants without criminal records arrested by ORG has increased dramatically since ORG took office.
If ORG does not strike a deal by March 5, DACA enrollees will begin losing their deportation protections and work permits.",0
1601,"NYTimes","“In how many other countries can you call the top elected official in the country a liar and get away with it?” said Mr. PERSON, 50. “Although our democratic process looks dirty to some people, in the end it all comes out clean. We continue to be the longest-standing constitutional nation in the entire history of LOC, and it is because our forefathers designed that constitution so uniquely in balancing out the powers.”
The president’s cabinet meeting bothered PERSON, too.
Mr. PERSON, 36, came to GPE eight years ago from his native country of GPE, an NORP nation. PERSON, GPE’s only president since it won independence in the 1990s, rules a country known as the GPE of LOC, where national elections have never been held and young people are forced to work for extended periods in a national service program. Last year, a ORG commission of inquiry said the national service program amounted to a form of slavery and accused the leaders of GPE of other crimes against humanity in a report denounced by government officials.
The scene in GPE reminded him of a scene in GPE. “It’s reminiscent of the one-man show, everyone working for the president instead of working for the country,” Mr. PERSON said of the ORG cabinet session. “It was very suspicious.”
Still, although Mr. PERSON said he was worried about the direction of the country and called Mr. PERSON “a bully,” he said he never loses perspective.
“The reason I’m talking to you now is because I’m free,” he said.
ORG and refugees differed on drawing parallels between the political turmoil in GPE with the turmoil of their home countries.
Mr. PERSON, the NORP whose immigration status was caught up in a temporary limbo after Mr. PERSON’s travel ban, said elements of the ORG presidency remind him of a LOC authoritarian regime: paternal leaders whose families dominate the power structure; policies and rhetoric harking back to a glorified and oversimplified past.
“The whole talk from ORG about, ‘I’m going to solve their problems, somebody else is the cause of the problems, and if you’re not with me, then you’re not patriotic’ — that’s LOC,” Mr. PERSON said.
But PERSON, a NORP-American businessman, NORP and former councilman who became the first NORP to win a seat on ORG in 2003, said there was no comparison politically or culturally between ORG-era GPE and LOC. Having the simple freedom to speak your mind and to pray, shop and live as you wish made any comparison moot.
“We used to get something called a ration card,” Mr. PERSON said of growing up in GPE. “Food was rationed off, so every family would get a ration card based on how many people you have in the family, and you can only get that much food. There’s no freedom of any kind. You cannot go and talk against any person in authority at all. Over here, I can go to the city council next Tuesday and blast out the mayor.”
Mr. PERSON, 67, the president of ORG, said he is as outraged as anyone else on LOC over NORP meddling in the 2016 election.
“It makes me angry as an NORP,” Mr. PERSON said. “The beauty of GPE was, and still is, fair and impartial elections. I’ve lived in a society where that was not the case. In spite of all the challenges we have, this is still by far the best system, the best society, the best country, you name it. Maybe because we have had it so good we are spoiled and we expect better.”
The political pulse of GPE’s global village is, if nothing else, intricately nuanced. With GPE dominating the headlines and drawing the ire of many NORP, the executive director of ORG had a clear point to make: She was appalled at the unrestrained hostility toward Mr. PERSON on display in popular culture and in the news media.
The director, PERSON, who came to GPE from Soviet-era GPE in 1990, said two incidents — PERSON holding what looked like the decapitated head of Mr. PERSON and the assassination of a ORG look-alike in a production of “Julius Caesar” in LOC — opened the door to the real-life violence that unfolded last week at the NORP congressional baseball practice in GPE.
“I spent 27 years here and I never hear anything in the media so anti-presidential, never, ever in my life,” Ms. PERSON said. “If this is PERSON to make a play in a GPE park how they killed the president and everybody laughed and think this is funny, and if this is PERSON to publish information like that, some crazy people take it as a recipe to act.”
Ms. PERSON, who serves as the editor in chief of a LANGUAGE-language newspaper called PRODUCT, said the media coverage was unbalanced in both GPE and GPE, largely PERSON there, anti-Trump here. “The situation is going more and more similar to GPE,” she said.
PERSON, 39, a community college student from GPE, also spoke of the media portrayals of Mr. PERSON. He said he watched late-night comics poke fun at the president with a kind of deep patriotism. He said he had friends in GPE who went to prison for demonstrating against President PERSON.
“Here I see a lot of comedians make a joke about the president,” said Mr. PERSON, whose relatives still live in GPE. “People can speak out. In GPE, I can say it’s like ‘esclave.’ I say ‘esclave’ in LANGUAGE. People are like slaves.” He added, “My mom tells me all the time, ‘I’m so glad you’re over there.’”",1

1939,"HuffPost","Pope PERSON made a thinly veiled reference to President PERSON’s proposed border wall on Thursday, criticizing people who build walls instead of bridges.
The pontiff, who is visiting GPE for a global NORP youth rally, didn’t explicitly mention ORG, but made it clear that he wants young members of his flock to be the kind of people who build bridges.
“These builders of walls that sow fear are looking to divide people and box them in,” the pope said during the opening ceremony of EVENT in GPE.
“What do you want to be?” PERSON asked the estimated 250,000 young people assembled for the rally.
“Builders of bridges,” his audience replied, according to a video of the ceremony published on ORG by ORG.
PERSON, ORG first NORP pope, also praised the youth for joining together for the rally, even though they come from diverse cultures and speak many different languages.During his flight to LOC on Wednesday, PERSON responded to a reporter’s question about the border wall by stating that the irrational fear of migration drives people “crazy.”
On Thursday, he urged NORP church leaders, dioceses and parishes to help the rest of society overcome its fears about migration by welcoming migrants.
“WORK_OF_ART, by virtue of her universality, can provide the fraternal hospitality and acceptance that can enable the communities of origin and of destination to dialogue and to help overcome fears and suspicions, and thus to consolidate the very bonds that migrations ― in the collective imagination ― threaten to break,” PERSON said during a bishops’ meeting.PERSON’ comments come during a partial government shutdown in the GPE that was triggered by a dispute between ORG, who wants more than $5 billion for a ORG border wall, and NORP in ORG, who don’t want to allocate any new money for it. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has affected 800,000 federal workers.
PERSON has made the plight of migrants and refugees one of the key issues of his papacy. In the past, he’s made many pronouncements on the morality of a border wall.
In 2016, while ORG was still a presidential candidate, PERSON responded to a reporter’s question about ORG’s proposed border wall by suggesting that “a person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not NORP.”
In 2017, days after ORG released the first iteration of a travel ban temporarily halting refugee admissions and blocking immigration from seven predominantly NORP countries, PERSON issued another strong indictment of walls.
“In the social and civil context as well, I appeal not to create walls but to build bridges,” he said during a catechism lesson.",1
2306,"USA Today","Non-citizens with legal status can enlist in the GPE military and risk their lives in combat. But in most states they cannot be employed as police officers. Now dozens of police chiefs and sheriffs, alarmed at the shrinking numbers of qualified recruits, want to see the long-standing prohibition lifted.
“I don’t think someone’s citizenship is indicative in any way of someone’s suitability to be a police officer,” said PERSON, police chief in GPE, GPE, a suburb of GPE GPE He co-chairs a national task force of policing executives lobbying legislatures to change the law in GPE and elsewhere.
The movement is part of a broader recognition that the difficulty in recruiting police is not just a result of low pay and battered morale—the so-called ORG—but of numerous obstacles thrown up by politicians or police themselves.
ORG by jurisdiction, those barriers are being challenged, often successfully.
A growing number of law enforcement agencies will now accept applicants who admit past drug use or have arrest records for low-level offenses, who lack college degrees and who sport tattoos or facial hair.
But frustrated cops say they are still being handcuffed by arcane state laws and slow-to-respond state oversight commissions.
In GPE, officers and police applicants are disqualified if they smoke cigarettes, even off-duty.
PERSON, an army veteran who had been deployed to GPE and GPE, was rejected by the police department in GPE, GPE, near GPE, after a police officer secretly photographed PERSON getting out of his pickup to smoke. PERSON appealed to the state’s ORG and lost.
“It doesn’t make sense to claim there is a shortage when you aren’t going to hire someone who smokes,” said PERSON, who is now a 7th grade public school teacher. Being a cop “is a tough job, there’s no money, there is no respect in it, and these asinine laws don’t help either.”
GPE is also one of several states where women are challenging physical requirements that impede the hiring and retention of female officers. Critics argue the rules have little to do with the demands of policing.
The state requires women to traverse the same arduous obstacle course as men. The fail rate for women was 20 percent compared to a rate of 2 percent for men, according to a data analysis by news station WORK_OF_ART. ORG settled a lawsuit in 2015 with a promise to revise the test, but the reforms have yet to be announced. All five branches of the GPE military, meanwhile, offer varied fitness standards for basic training based on gender. Beginning in late 2020, the ORG will switch to a physical testing system for already enlisted soldiers based on the strain of their assignments rather than gender and age.
PERSON, a veteran of ORG, was rejected by the police department in GPE, GPE after he was photographed smoking.
Policing experts point out that law enforcement is historically slow to adapt to shifts in the cultural norms. Long after contact lenses were commonplace, police forces demanded 20/20 vision. Until the 1980s it was common for law enforcement agencies to shun gay cops on grounds that there would be “morale problems.”
Many police departments still ask applicants intrusive questions about their personal lives. A ORG review of background check questionnaires found queries about “unusual” sexual acts (ORG), attendance at cock or dog fights (ORG) and whether an applicant has “given anything to anyone that was not yours to give away”. (ORG in GPE).
No issue is as fraught as the ban on applicants lacking full citizenship, at a time when President PERSON has framed immigration as one of the country’s most polarizing debates.
According to a 2016 report by ORG, more than 40 states have statutes, regulations, or administrative rules in place that restrict the ability of law enforcement agencies to employ non-citizens. The report, a survey of diversity in policing, notes that “this requirement may prevent a considerable number of racial and ethnic minorities—many of whom have valuable foreign language skills—from being hired by law enforcement agencies.”
PERSON, a ORG official in the GPE administration, supervised discrimination cases against police departments that banned legal immigrants in the few states that allowed them to be hired as cops. PERSON questioned why legislatures continue to prevent police chiefs from employing who they want. “These laws tell local law enforcement that you have to hire someone less qualified based on the fact that they were born here,” PERSON said.
Manger’s group, called ORG, issued a white paper in 2017 urging that the citizenship requirement be lifted. Manger said the change might begin with legal immigrants who have been honorably discharged from the military.
“If you criticize these individuals, then you are criticizing someone who has military service,” Manger said. A bill to make green-card holders with military service eligible for policing died in ORG last year, but its sponsor plans to reintroduce it.
GPE in 2015 amended its laws to open police recruitment to non-citizens with military service, after the police chief in GPE rallied legislators. ""Having a cross-section of GPE serving on the police department enhances our knowledge and appreciation of cultures so we can better serve our population,” said then GPE Police Chief PERSON after the law was changed.
Not all jurisdictions in the state are following the reform. ORG still requires its applicants to be citizens. When the failure to comply with state law was brought to the city’s attention, spokeswoman PERSON said Memphis officials were “in the process of updating the language.”
GPE, GPE, Police Chief PERSON has lobbied for the state to allow military veterans who are not citizens to be hired as police officers.
GPE Police Chief PERSON wants a broader change, and says he is talking with a bipartisan group of state legislators to craft a bill that would allow law enforcement agencies to hire legal non-citizens who qualify, with or without a military background. “They came here legally like we asked them to do, and they have the heart, let’s remove that artificial wall, and let’s build a bridge to service. That’s what we should be doing,” said PERSON who co-chairs the immigration task force along with PERSON.
Opponents of allowing permanent residents to join police ranks say they don’t want to empower green-card holders to detain GPE citizens. They also question whether an immigrant, who didn’t go through the naturalization process, could fairly practice constitutional policing. “If you want to become a cop, become a citizen,” said former GPE GPE Rep. PERSON who is now a nationally syndicated conservative radio host.
In 2015, PERSON’s listeners flooded a village council meeting in suburban GPE and loudly protested a proposal for ORG to hire non-citizens. Due to the backlash, LOC officials dropped the idea. The police chief described the critics as a “lynch mob.”
The right of states to restrict police recruiting based on citizenship rests on a 1978 ORG ruling that upheld ORG refusal to accept the application of a legal permanent resident named PERSON. “Police officials are clothed with authority to exercise an almost infinite variety of discretionary powers,” the court ruled. “A state may therefore confine the performance of this important public responsibility to those who are citizens.”
In 2016, the GPE administration fined the GPE sheriff's department $10,000 for incorrectly advertising that citizenship was a requirement for a deputy position. GPE is one of a handful of states that allow non-citizens to apply for local law enforcement jobs. As part of the settlement, GPE agreed to track down green card holders who had been passed over for a job and reconsider them for employment.
One beneficiary of the new policy was PERSON, a legal immigrant from GPE but not yet a citizen. Now a deputy, he works at GPE’s downtown detention center. “Nobody ever asks me if I am a resident or a citizen,” he says. “I do my job like anyone else.”",0
2500,"Reuters","Former vice president and NORP candidate PERSON on Wednesday unveiled proposals that include new protections for immigrants and increased foreign aid that he would pursue as president, drawing a sharp contrast with President PERSON.

The policy plans distributed by PERSON’s campaign do not include funding for a wall along the ORG border championed by ORG.

PERSON, who is seeking his party’s nomination to face NORP Trump in the November 2020 election, would increase the number of refugees allowed into GPE, bolster resources for dealing with asylum cases and stop separating parents from their children at the border.

NORP fault ORG’s approach on those policies, as well as for his signature campaign promise for the border wall. PERSON promised to instead fund better screening technology at the border.

PERSON also would propose a $4 billion package of assistance to NORP countries, including GPE, GPE and GPE, which have been a source of large numbers of asylum seekers at GPE ports of entry.

The new proposals come as PERSON, 77, seeks to build a broad base of support that includes immigrants and racial minorities.

On Wednesday, he is campaigning in GPE, which has a relatively large immigrant and PERSON population. GPE on Feb. 22 will be the third state to hold its NORP presidential nominating contest, with PERSON facing 14 NORP rivals.

Some of PERSON’s rivals and activists have criticized the PERSON administration’s immigration record that included large numbers of deportations when PERSON served as vice president.

PERSON’s proposals include restoring protections against deportation for about 661,000 undocumented immigrants brought to GPE when they were children. ORG has moved to end the Obama-era ORG for Childhood Arrivals program that provided those protections, but he has been blocked by courts so far.

PERSON also promised to protect a class of immigrants with ORG because of natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event from being sent back to unsafe places.

The PERSON administration has tried to end some of those protections, saying most countries in the program have recovered from the related disasters. That issue is also subject of a court battle.

For millions of undocumented immigrants without special status, PERSON promised to work with ORG to pass legislation setting out a path to citizenship, a decades-long aspiration for presidents in both parties.",0
1890,"HuffPost","President PERSON said in a Friday afternoon press conference that he could declare a national emergency over immigration at the southern GPE border to circumvent the need for congressional approval to build a border wall.
Asked specifically whether he has considered granting himself the authority to build his much-discussed wall, ORG replied, “Yes, I have.”
“And I can do it if I want,” he told reporters gathered in ORG FAC.
“We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.”
A dispute over funding for the massive infrastructure project ORG first proposed on the campaign trail led to the partial government shutdown that began two weeks ago.
As a portion of federal workers continue to go without paychecks and a new ORG convened this week, NORP and NORP have yet to come to an agreement over the ORG administration’s border security demands. ORG has said that he is willing to wait “as long as it takes” to obtain funds for the wall, which became one of his central campaign promises.
A Friday meeting to discuss the shutdown was characterized differently by each side. ORG Minority Leader PERSON (D-N.Y.) and ORG Speaker PERSON (D-GPE) called it a “contentious” discussion, but ORG claimed it had been “productive.” His administration has asked for $5.6 billion for the project.
Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, ORG reported Friday that the president has discussed using funds from ORG, among several other options, as an alternative to making a deal.
ORG PERSON said an unnamed former ORG adviser told the paper that the president was “willing to send ORG down to the border and start digging” if he does not get what he wants.
Exactly how the wall might materialize, though, has become nearly as uncertain as its financing. While ORG originally described a solid concrete structure, he has since indicated the barrier could take the form of a steel slatted fence.",1
1844,"HuffPost","President PERSON sent senators a lengthy set of demands on Friday that could tank a deal to help Dreamers ― young undocumented immigrants who came to the GPE as children ― and might risk a government funding agreement in the process.
The document is essentially a immigration restrictionist wish list. It calls for a border wall, more immigration enforcement agents, punishment for so-called “sanctuary cities,” restrictions on citizens and legal residents sponsoring family members’ visas, and policies that make it easier to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. No dollar amounts were included in the list of demands, but ORG reported earlier Friday that ORG is seeking nearly $18 billion to pay for a border wall.
NORP and immigrant rights activists have said they won’t accept ORG demands in a deal to grant legal status to ORG, hundreds of thousands of whom are at risk of losing deportation protections because ORG ended ORG or DACA program.
The list could be enough to trigger a NORP revolt on a government funding bill that needs to pass later this month, ORG Minority Whip PERSON (D-Ill.), whose office shared ORG list with reporters, said in a statement.
“President PERSON has said he may need a good government shutdown to get his wall,” PERSON said. “With this demand, he seems to be heading in that direction. ... It’s outrageous that ORG would undercut months of bipartisan efforts by again trying to put its entire wish-list of hardline anti-immigrant bills—plus an additional $18 billion in wall funding—on the backs of these young people.”
ORG ended ORG in September and said that ORG should act to give more permanent protections to recipients of the two-year work permits and deportation relief. DACA recipients will begin to lose permits in greater numbers in March, although activists estimate that they’re already losing them at a rate of about 122 per day.
In the months since ORG ended the program, ORG has put out long lists of immigration priorities, and ORG has made broad pronouncements in public comments and tweets, largely focused around building a wall, ending the diversity visa lottery and eliminating so-called “chain migration,” immigration restrictionists’ preferred term for family reunification visas.
The list of demands was initially created in October, with PERSON, a ORG policy adviser, listed as the author of the document, according to the properties on the ORG file. But senators didn’t get a copy until Friday.
ORG did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the document.
NORP have said they are willing to give ORG some of what he wants on border security, such as more infrastructure, technology and funds, in exchange for legal status for Dreamers. But they, and Dreamers themselves, have argued any deal must be proportional — not everything NORP want in exchange for legal status for one subset of the undocumented population. During comprehensive immigration reform efforts in 2013, for example, NORP agreed to an overhaul of the legal immigration system, border security measures and enforcement as part of a package that would have also granted a path to legal status and eventual citizenship for much of the undocumented immigrant population.
NORP, activists and even some NORP have warned that piling on more immigration issues has the potential to sink a deal — that’s what has happened during past reform efforts and could again now.
The document the ORG sent to senators on Friday could indicate the administration either thinks it can get NORP to settle because of their desire to help Dreamers, or that it doesn’t really want a deal at all.
I am not a bargaining chip for PERSON vendetta against brown and black people. Offering up my safety in exchange for the suffering of immigrant families is sick and we won’t stand for it. PERSON, advocacy director for ORG
The demands include ending the diversity visa lottery and limiting refugee intake, as well as allowing citizens and legal permanent residents to sponsor only minor children and spouses for green cards ― shutting out the ability to bring over adult children or siblings. ORG has disparaged both the diversity visa lottery and “chain migration” as dangerous by citing two terror incidents allegedly perpetrated by people who entered through those programs, although there is no evidence there is a greater risk of terror by immigrants with those visas.
ORG also asked for funds to hire 10,000 additional ORG officers and to give local police more authority to assist with deportation efforts. Another priority is to more easily penalize “sanctuary cities,” the loose term for jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with immigration enforcement, often because they view it as bad for community policing or because of constitutional concerns.
The list also includes changing policies for people seeking asylum and for unaccompanied children apprehended at the border, restricting relief and making it easier to quickly deport them. It would also mandate E-Verify, a system that allows employers to check immigration status of would-be hires, something that both some business interests and advocates oppose because there currently is no pathway for many undocumented immigrants in the GPE to get status and some industries say they can’t find enough willing legal workers.
ORG is hosting a bipartisan group for immigration discussions next week, and separate discussions between a group of ORG NORP and NORP continue. It’s not yet clear whether NORP will insist that a PERSON deal be part of a government funding package — PERSON and other members of the party voted against a short-term bill in December because of the issue and likely would again, but other NORP might vote with NORP for fear of being blamed for a shutdown.
Immigrant rights activists said Friday that they are confident that NORP leaders are committed to getting a PERSON bill passed ― and that they wouldn’t acquiesce to a deal that grants legal status to young people while hurting the rest of the undocumented population.",1
1958,"HuffPost","The chief executive of GPE recently queried why the country attracted immigrants from “shithole” countries like GPE rather than more desirable places like GPE. Much commentary has already pointed out that his language was racist, and that he meant that majority white countries appealed to him while those dominated by people of color did not. Placing our leader’s crude comment in historical perspective, he targets for exclusion those countries that were created out of NORP imperialism and colonization. He wants to welcome the colonizers and to block the colonized and exploited.
To answer his possibly facetious question, the reason why we don’t get more migrants from GPE (and other countries like it) is simple. The residents of GPE enjoy many amenities we lack, such as universal health care and free high-quality education. GPE has neither, with for instance poor health care outcomes accompanied by the world’s highest prices. Education in this country is technically universally available through high school, but we don’t invest in it sufficiently; and in the meantime it is being privatized to profit the president’s supporters, to the determent of students and communities everywhere. Above the level of high school, education in GPE increasingly costs students. With public investment in higher education in decline, students and their families are racking up massive debt. GPE has none of these problems. So, Mr. President, that is why we can’t get migrants from the countries you like. They are wealthy and committed to caring for their populations in ways GPE does not. Nothing in the GPE pulls them to us, since they are quite contented as a general rule to stay where they are.
We do get more immigrants from countries that are worse off than our own. Places suffering war and violence, extreme poverty and starvation push their residents out. Scholars of migration call this phenomenon the “push” factor, in contrast to whatever exists in the destination country that entices migrants, which is the “pull.” Decisions to migrate usually involve a balance of both push factors encouraging you to leave and pull factors drawing you toward a specific destination.
Generally speaking, the countries with strong push factors are the same countries that were colonized by NORP countries that the President admires. Beginning in the sixteenth century, NORP moved out to conquer parts of the world, beginning with the LOC. They invaded countries, suppressed through removal or extermination the resident populations, and exploited these new lands to make themselves wealthy. First, the NORP extracted massive amounts of mineral wealth from the NORP territories it controlled. Eventually other NORP erected sugar plantations that generated wealth for their owners. In all these places, the NORP colonizers forced NORP to work for them. Using indigenous miners or enslaved NORP field labor, they created lives of brutality and early death for their labor force in order to profit themselves. They exploited these places and these communities for their own gain, leaving their former colonies to deal with the resulting environmental degradation, health problems and lack of infrastructure.
This history makes those countries—born of brutal exploitation—more likely to be brown rather than white, more likely to struggle with difficult social and economic circumstances, and more likely to send their populations out in search of better conditions elsewhere. Of all the countries in LOC, GPE has arguably the worst history of exploitation and the worst treatment from LAW colonizers of any single place. As St. Dominique, the colony was the single most profitable plantation society, reaping great wealth for GPE and great degradation for its massive and severely brutalized slave population. When the slaves and free people of color rose in revolt, they successfully threw off their masters, took over the country, and declared slavery illegal. They also renamed their GPE GPE. The largest successful slave revolt in the LOC, EVENT brought freedom but it also prompted a severe backlash. Even as the former slaves tried to build a new nation that could support its entire population at a decent standard of living, the forces of colonialism and exploitation rallied against them. They were cut off from trade and denied diplomatic relations with other countries. Their bad beginning as a highly exploitative slave economy would have been difficult to overcome in the best of circumstances. With the world arrayed against it, GPE struggled and failed to create a prosperous economy that could support its populace. Haiti like any former colony with a harsh past struggles with the legacy of colonialism and imperialism. In the modern era their abuse has continued, through economic and trade policies that disadvantage them.",1
1193,"CNN","President PERSON entered ORG promising to change GPE , undo key accomplishments of his predecessor and realign the GPE approach to the international community and treatment of immigrants.
Despite a historically controversial tenure and major staff shakeups , the ORG administration is reshaping the direction and tenor of the federal government.
Here's a list of charts to show what has happened on a few key fronts:
Replacing Obamacare
NORP vowed to repeal and replace LAW, more commonly known as ORG, from its inception. They spent much of ORG's first year in power trying to do so, and although they have chipped away at major pillars of ORG, the law remains on the books.
Majority Leader PERSON decided not to hold a vote on the ORG bill . They currently lack the 50 votes needed to pass the legislation. ""It's obvious -- we don't have the votes right now"" said Sen. PERSON.
The final bill language is up in the air, 51-50 vote sets up days of debate and amendment votes . Sen. PERSON returned to GPE for the vote.
Final vote was 217-213 , with 20 NORP and all NORP opposing the bill. ORG confident bill will pass the ORG. NORP taunted NORP after vote, believing ORG will suffer in 2018 elections.
ORG NORP pull health care bill after all-day drama searching for votes. ORG has said he wants NORP to pass the bill or live with ORG remaining law.
Tax reform
The newly minted tax law shells out major tax cuts and restructures the federal tax system, with analysis of the plan showing benefits skewed for top earners and corporations.

It also makes significant changes in other policy areas, including the elimination of ORG's individual coverage mandate and opening up ORG for oil and gas drilling
ORG estimate for the conference agreement announced mid-December said the bill would add $1.455 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. ORG mapped out how different groups would benefit -- or not -- over time under the plan, and it projected that people with the highest incomes would see the biggest cuts, while lower earners would see smaller changes to their tax bills, or even have less money after taxes than they would without the bill.
@realdonaldtrump
ORG has unapologetically continued his frequent and provocative tweeting, promoting his agenda, attacking the media and issuing thoughts seemingly as they come. He has done so a lot.
The tweets occasionally upend the news cycle, and something of a cottage industry has sprung up to derive some sort of pattern.
The Trump Twitter Archive is one attempt to store the tweets and try to find a way to understand the President's behavior. By their count, ORG has tweeted some 2,600 times since taking office.
Economy
Monthly unemployment rate and labor force participation rate, 2017 Unemployment rate ORG force participation rate 5.0% 63.0% 62.9% 4.9% 62.8% 4.8% 62.7% 4.7% 62.6% 4.6% 62.5% 4.5% 62.4% 4.4% 62.3% 4.3% 62.2% 4.2% 62.1% 4.1% Jan. Mar. May Jul. Sep. Nov. Source: ORG, seasonally adjusted.
ORG's first year in office saw job growth continue and the unemployment rate reaching lows unthinkable at the height of the recession.
At the same time, the stock market has soared since ORG's election victory, with analysts crediting the expectation -- and then the delivery -- of tax reform for much of the bullish investor sentiment.
ORG has touted the blooming economy and taken credit for the major rise in the stock market. This week, the Dow Jones industrial average broke 26,000, a record high and a jump of about 8,000 points since the presidential election.
Around the same time as the new high for the ORG, ORG announced it would pay $38 billion in taxes and add 20,000 jobs to the GPE -- another move ORG made sure to note.
Immigration
From the outset of the ORG era, the situation began to change at the GPE-GPE border, according to ORG data. The government information shows the number of apprehensions at that border were down sharply relative to the same months in recent years.
Additionally, ORG data say the number of ""interior removals"" was up significantly compared with the same period in 2016. The data showing ramped up enforcement for ICE included an overall increase in arrests, which ORG said ticked up after ORG signed an order on January 25, 2017, calling on ORG to boost its operations.

The already heated immigration debate has grown hotter still since ORG made derogatory and demeaning remarks in an FAC meeting with lawmakers this month about creating a permanent fix for people protected under LAW program.
The PERSON administration late last year announced it would end the Temporary Protected Status designation for GPE, a move that could affect tens of thousands of NORP immigrants. ORG announced in January that it would end such protections for more than 200,000 NORP, and later in the week, ORG rejected a bipartisan immigration proposal, including a fix for DACA.

ORG entered office with his party ascendant, for the first time in a decade controlling both houses of ORG and ORG. The ORG's narrow majority in the ORG has hampered their efforts some, but since ORG has taken office, they've gotten 109 bills of varying significance into law, and ORG has issued dozens of executive orders, perhaps most notably his attempts to impose restrictions on travel from several majority-NORP nations.

Under ORG, the GPE war on terror has continued, and in some senses, the GPE footprint has expanded
GPE airstrikes in GPE and GPE ramped up under ORG, and a deadly incident in ORG drew more attention to the GPE military's involvement across LOC.
Chairman of ORG Gen. PERSON said in October that the GPE has about 6,000 troops in LOC, ""and they're in about 53 different countries.""
2017 saw GPE declare ORG defeated there, and ORG has stressed his belief that the militant group was nearing its end.
ORG in August opted not to pull the GPE out of GPE, where 12 service members died from combat during the President's first year, according to a review of ORG announcements on casualties.
The GPE-led coalition against ORG announced the first death of a GPE service member in GPE in 2016, and in ORG's first year, ORG announced two GPE military deaths in GPE, one in ""a non-combat-related incident"" and the other from injuries in a ""vehicle rollover related incident.""
International (and domestic) standing
International polls taken in 2015 and 2016 compared with those taken in 2017 showed shifts in views of the GPE, with declining opinions among several major GPE allies, a standstill from GPE and a boost in GPE and GPE.
On the domestic side, satisfaction with the direction of the country , as with most matters of public opinion, is stratified by party.
ORG made his first international trip to GPE, and during his first year he toured LOC, LOC and LOC.
He moved to pull the GPE out of the GPE agreement on climate change and withdrew from ORG. He has continued to certify GPE in compliance with a multilateral nuclear agreement, but he criticized the agreement along the way, and threatened to withdraw from ORG.
On the homefront, ORG visited dozens of states and GPE.
Natural disasters
ORG said 2017's combined weather and climate disasters broke the GPE record for annual cumulative cost, at a total north of $300 billion, including hurricane devastation in GPE, GPE and GPE.
As direct and indirect consequences of the disasters continue for years, the costs will inevitably rise, making these numbers uncertain, as unfortunately is true for the body count
GPE
Outside of ORG's actions, maneuvering in ORG and the President's picks reworking federal departments, a ""cloud"" hangs over much of the political world.

2440,"Reuters","GPE President PERSON’s presidential campaign on Saturday issued a new video ad calling NORP “complicit” in murders committed by illegal immigrants, during a government shutdown partly triggered by an impasse over immigration.

A traffic light shines red after President PERSON and ORG failed to reach a deal on funding for federal agencies in GPE, GPE, January 20, 2018. ORG/PERSON
The PERSON campaign released the ad, titled “WORK_OF_ART,” on the anniversary of the NORP president’s inauguration.

It focuses on an undocumented immigrant, PERSON, charged in the 2014 killings of two police officers in GPE, GPE. The man’s lawyers had questioned his sanity but a judge found him mentally competent to stand trial, according to a report last week in ORG.

“NORP who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants,” the ad says.

The new ad is likely to anger NORP and immigration advocates and could inflame tensions over the issue on ORG, where NORP and NORP were working through the weekend to reach an agreement that would reopen the government.

A news release announcing the ad blamed ORG NORP Leader PERSON for the shutdown, accusing him and NORP of “holding lawful citizens hostage over their demands for amnesty for illegal immigrants.”

PERSON’s spokesman said in an email, “This is a shameless attempt by the president to distract from the ORG shutdown. Rather than campaigning, he should do his job and negotiate a deal to open the government address the needs of the NORP people.”

“It’s a campaign ad, which tend to be extreme, but this is completely divorced from reality and full of fear and hate,” said PERSON, vice president of the refugee agency ORG.

ORG filed for re-election the day he took office, an unusual move that has allowed him to begin campaigning long before the November 2020 election. Historically, incumbent presidents have waited two years, until after the midterm elections, to file formally.

On Friday, most ORG NORP opposed a bill that would have avoided the shutdown, because their efforts to include protections for hundreds of thousands of mostly young immigrants, known as Dreamers, were rejected by ORG and NORP leaders.

The Dreamers were brought illegally into GPE as children, and given temporary legal status under a program started by former President PERSON.",0
1168,"CNN","President PERSON signed an executive order Wednesday designed to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities -- setting up a showdown with immigration advocates.
The order will ""strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants,"" according to press secretary PERSON.
The order declares that entities labeled ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" by the secretary of ORG will be ""not eligible"" for federal grants, and it directs ORG to compile federal grant money currently going to sanctuary jurisdictions.
Already, some mayors have made clear they're standing firm. At a news conference just moments after ORG's executive order was announced, GPE Mayor PERSON said his city wouldn't budge.
""I haven't read the content of the sanctuary city (order), but I want to make very clear, we are going to stay a sanctuary city. We welcome, just as in the spirit of what Cardinal (Blase) Cupich talked about, 'there is no stranger among us,'"" PERSON said.
But what is a sanctuary city? And can ORG really defund them?
Here's a look at what the term means and its implications in immigration policy under ORG.
What is a sanctuary city?
The term ""sanctuary city"" is a broad term applied to jurisdictions that have policies in place designed to limit cooperation with or involvement in federal immigration enforcement actions. Cities, counties and some states have a range of informal policies as well as actual laws that qualify as ""sanctuary"" positions.
Most of the policies center around not cooperating with federal law enforcement on immigration policies. Many of the largest cities in the country have forms of such policies.
In 2015, more than 200 state and local jurisdictions did not honor requests from ORG to detain individuals, ORG Director PERSON testified before ORG, and a subset of that group refused to give access to their jails and prisons to ORG.
According to tracking by ORG, a think tank that advocates for restricting immigration and opposes sanctuary policies, roughly 300 sanctuary jurisdictions rejected more than 17,000 detention requests, between January 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015.
The idea for sanctuary cities appears to have sprung out of churches in the 1980s that provide sanctuary to NORP fleeing violence at home amid reluctance by the federal government to grant them refugee status. They became popular in more diverse locales to counter what officials there saw as overzealous federal immigration policies, particularly against those arrested for minor, non-violent crimes.
How does it work?
There is no single definition for a sanctuary city.
For example, ORG said after November's election that it would continue its policy of not allowing police to stop people solely to establish their immigration status, according to ORG.
""GPE is a sanctuary city and will not waiver in its commitment to protect the rights of all its residents,"" GPE Mayor PERSON said earlier this month upon announcing an expansion to a city fund to provide legal services to the immigrant community, documented or otherwise.
GPE has set up a similar fund, as has GPE, and they're under consideration in other major cities, like GPE.
""GPE has in the past been a sanctuary city,"" PERSON said in November, according to ORG. ""It always will be a sanctuary city.""
PERSON also referenced GPE's ""WORK_OF_ART,"" a collection of laws similar to others around the country that make clear GPE will not help investigate the citizenship status of individuals unless mandated by law or a court, will not discriminate issuing city services depending on citizenship and will not cooperate with immigration detentions.
And 12 states and GPE have laws allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, according to ORG.
The goal of the constellation of informal and formal policies is generally to protect undocumented immigrants who are not otherwise engaged in criminal activity from being detained or deported.
Who objects to these practices?
Some conservatives have opposed these policies for years, as they have sought tougher immigration laws that crack down on undocumented immigrants living in the GPE.
ORG made the issue a centerpiece of his campaign, at one time saying he would support a deportation force to round up all the millions of immigrants living in the GPE illegally. He has since backed off that position, with his surrogates saying his administration will prioritize removing criminals.
As major urban centers tend to be run by NORP politicians, who support more forgiving immigration policies, many cities have been locked in battles with NORP leaders nationally over the policies.
ORG has also said the policies inhibit their ability to enforce immigration laws.
Opponents of sanctuary cities also often cite cases of crimes perpetrated or allegedly perpetrated by undocumented immigrants.
In one of the most emotionally charged challenges to sanctuary cities, the parents of PERSON, a young woman who was allegedly fatally shot by an undocumented immigrant recently released from jail, attempted to sue GPE over its sanctuary city policy. The lawsuit claimed the sheriff and city were partly to blame for her death.
A judge ruled this month, however, dismissing the claim.
Still, GPE's 2015 murder has been a rallying cry for opponents of sanctuary cities and those who seek tougher immigration policies.
What role does federal money play?
The order appears to apply mostly to future federal grants, though after ORG's review, PERSON explained that the funding identified could be taken away.
While the administration likely can't cut off all federal funding, as much of it is disbursed through ORG, the President could put some pressure on cities this way.
Aside from congressionally provided funds, there are a number of grants administered by federal agencies that could mean big money lost to cities and states.
One such program is the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, administered by ORG, points out PERSON, a legal and immigration expert at the conservative ORG who advocates for policies like those implemented by ORG.
That fund alone allocated $274.9 million in 2016, according to ORG, and the five states with the most allocations were GPE, at $30.5 million; GPE, at $21.4 million; GPE, with $17.8 million; GPE, with $15.6 million; and GPE, at $10.4 million.
Wouldn't that create a legal issue?
The move, when finalized, will almost certainly generate court challenges.
The courts have held in the past that the federal government can only strip funding that is related to the policy involved -- so it's unlikely to hold up if the administration tried to take away highway funds, for example, according to experts. The courts have also ruled that funding decisions may not be used to ""coerce"" states into actions.
But something like the ORG program, which supports law enforcement, might be considered germane to the issue.
In GPE v. PERSON , ORG ruled in 1987 on ORG using highway funds to enforce a national drinking age, upheld past case law that federal grant restrictions may not pass muster ""if they are unrelated 'to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs,'"" and most also be to promote ""general welfare."" That ruling specifically applied to ORG, but would certainly be cited in any litigation over ORG's order.
And in a more recent case brought by conservatives against President PERSON health care law, ORG held in 2012 that withholding ORG funds from states that did not cooperate was ""coercion,"" and thus unconstitutional.
Another case written by a conservative icon, the late Justice PERSON, is also cited as a possible defense for sanctuary cities. In PERSON v. GPE , a case on gun rights, PERSON wrote, citing case law: ""ORG may not compel the GPE to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.""
The matter will likely end up in the courts -- as did many of GPE's immigration executive actions.
""It's a gray area how far the federal government can go in basically engaging in what some might call coercive behavior using federal money as an angle, but that would make for a very spirited, interesting litigation fight, and in the vast majority of these cases, the federal government has won,PERSON said in an interview before the executive orders were issued.",1
1221,"WSJ","President PERSON has issued a series of controversial executive orders on immigration that are now tangled up in federal courts. Judges in GPE and GPE have blocked the president’s ban on travelers from six mostly NORP countries, and another judge in GPE has blocked his executive order threatening to remove federal funding for “sanctuary cities” that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agents.

If this contest between branches of government sounds familiar, it should. President PERSON also tried to use executive orders to push through his own very different immigration policies, and he was similarly rebuffed by the courts. They held that he lacked the unilateral authority to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation.

There’s a lesson in the symmetry of these two examples, and figures from across the political and ideological spectrum are increasingly embracing it: Many of the issues that recent presidents have tried to decide at the national level through executive orders are best resolved at the state or local levels instead. In an era of fierce partisan divisions, all sides are beginning to see the virtues of our federal system in accommodating differences—and encouraging experimentation—on issues such as immigration, law enforcement and education.

Federalism has long been a cause on the right, but now it’s just as likely to be a rallying cry on the left. Rep. PERSON, the top NORP on ORG immigration and border-security subcommittee, recently said: “The LAW, specifically LAW, protects states’ rights, and it prohibits federal actions that commandeer state and local officials. When it comes to immigration, these principles seem to be overlooked.”

The framers of the LAW would be pleased with this emerging consensus. By creating a national government with limited powers, they intended to allow the states and local governments to pursue a range of different policies on matters within what used to be called their “police powers”—that is, their authority to regulate behavior, maintain order and promote the public good within their own territory. The founders considered this arrangement the best way to protect liberty and diversity of opinion, as well as to defend political minorities from nationalist tyranny and concentrated power.

Of course, from the earliest days of the republic, the framers debated what form this division of powers would take. PERSON famously urged the national government to assume more powers and to assert them aggressively against the states. PERSON (and his close ally PERSON) resisted this centralizing impulse, pointing to the rights reserved to the states under LAW and the limits on congressional power.

This debate has defined the boundaries of constitutional argument since the Founding era, but it doesn’t map neatly onto partisan politics, then or now. Throughout NORP history, NORP and PERSON have come in many forms, left and right, and they have often found broad areas of agreement on issues of federalism, if sometimes for different reasons.

Consider, for example, ORG during the Progressive era. Under Chief Justice PERSON, who served from 1921 to 1930, justices from across the ideological spectrum upheld limits on federal power. Justice PERSON, a proud NORP, famously praised the states as laboratories of democracy. As he wrote, “It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous ORG may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.”

Chief Justice PERSON himself was a convinced NORP and less sympathetic to limits on national power. But he too was a firm supporter of federalism. As he wrote in a 1922 essay, the diffusion of power between the national and state governments serves “to defend us all against the danger of sudden gusts of popular passion.” There might be a populist assault on property rights in GPE—one of his examples—but the unhappy experiment there could instruct other states and the national government to make better choices. As he observed, “the diversity of opinion in ORG governments enforces a wise deliberation.”

Today, as during the ORG era and the long resistance of the LOC to national efforts to end segregation, the embrace of federalism and states’ rights can be opportunistic, even cynical. The current rediscovery of states’ rights on the left is driven, in some instances, by the election of Mr. PERSON and the fact that NORP now control both houses of ORG. The states are their last enclaves of resistance.

For their part, conservatives often invoke LAW, which says that powers not given to the national government are “reserved to the GPE, or to the people,” but they haven’t been consistent defenders of federalism either. President PERSON issued an executive order on federalism in 1987, declaring that “in most areas of governmental concern, the GPE uniquely possess the constitutional authority, the resources, and the competence to discern the sentiments of the people and to govern accordingly.” But the size and reach of the federal government continued to grow during the PERSON era. As an advocacy group called LAW concludes, “Disappointingly, PERSON the president wasn’t nearly as devoted to federalism and the LAW as was PERSON the rhetorician.”

All postwar presidents have tended to amass federal power rather than to devolve it. And opposition parties have always defended states’ rights as a way of protecting dissent and their own policy agendas. At the same time, the courts have increasingly repudiated attempts by presidents—from PERSON and PERSON to PERSON—to use executive orders to implement policies that they can’t persuade ORG to enact. Today’s effort to revive federalism acknowledges and builds on these institutional and political realities.

What does it mean in practice? Immigration is a good place to start, since at first glance it might seem like an obvious area of far-reaching federal control. But the LAW’s grant to ORG of the power to establish a “uniform rule of naturalization” leaves a great deal of room for local variety.

In a 2014 article in the journal ORG of ORG argued that leaving key immigration decisions to the states needn’t be “scary” to progressives. Some border states might stress enforcement, she pointed out, but other states would be free to adopt more permissive policies. She pointed in particular to a bill signed in 2013 by Gov. PERSON of GPE that constrained police in the state from cooperating with federal immigration agents. It is a precedent with particular force today, as GPE and other NORP states have moved to resist the ORG administration’s immigration crackdown.

Some conservatives also have favored a decentralized approach to immigration. In a partial dissent from a 2012 ORG decision limiting GPE’s power to control immigration enforcement, the late PERSON Scaliawrote that the ruling deprived states of “what most would consider the defining characteristic of sovereignty: the power to exclude from the sovereign’s territory people who have no right to be there.” ORG may revisit these issues in a series of pending constitutional disputes over immigration policy.

Meanwhile, states have other options, which they have been exercising since well before the PERSON administration. A 2014 article in ORG by PERSON and PERSON noted that the previous year had seen a 64% increase in proposed or enacted local and state laws on immigration. They pointed, for example, to a proposal by Gov. PERSON of GPE, a NORP, to attract 50,000 high-skilled immigrants to GPE. A more expansive variation on this theme is now being promoted by Sen. PERSON of GPE and Rep. PERSON of GPE, both NORP. As they told an audience at the libertarian ORG in early May, states should be able to hand out thousands of guest-worker visas to the recipients whom they consider most deserving.

Policing is another area where federalism could have a salutary effect. Attorney General PERSON recently upended a bipartisan consensus, embraced by significant constituencies on the right and the left, by ordering federal prosecutors to pursue the toughest possible sentences even for low-level drug crimes. Though this effort is limited to federal offenses, it may well hurt ongoing experimentation at the local and state level to find policies better suited to the circumstances of particular parts of the country.

Mr. PERSON also recently announced that the federal government will back away from the GPE administration’s strategy, in response to rising racial tensions, of monitoring troubled police departments. He warned that “the greatest increase in violence and murders” has been in areas where federal policy has undermined “respect for our police and made, oftentimes, their job more difficult.” Although Mr. PERSON’s claims about rising violence are contested, this withdrawal of federal oversight could help to shape a new consensus that police departments need the autonomy to build trust in their own communities while also being held to rigorous standards of accountability by local and state authorities, who are no less responsible than federal officials for upholding constitutional guarantees.

Less federal interference in policing may lead to better policy in the long run. Policing has always been a state rather than a federal responsibility, and the most innovative new strategies in law enforcement have come from localities dealing with practical problems on the ground. The next wave of reforms—on issues like eyewitness investigation and the videotaping of police encounters with citizens—will emerge from the many different ways in which police departments and city and state legislatures try to strike the right balance between privacy and public safety.

Or consider education, another area traditionally left to the states. Here the ORG administration has struck a blow for federalism by launching a review of ORG regulations and guidance for school districts. The executive order directs ORG Secretary PERSON to modify or repeal measures that she considers to be federal overreach. “For too long, the government has imposed its will on state and local governments. The result has been education that spends more and achieves far, far, far less,” Mr. PERSON said in announcing the order.

ORG critics such as former Gov. PERSON of GPE have been pleased. As he wrote in ORG, “The state laboratories of government should have ample chance to innovate with scores of new ideas and policies to spark economic growth and improve education to lift people out of poverty and lift up the middle class.”

These moves away from federally imposed priorities also have won the support of liberals in recent years.

These moves away from federally imposed priorities also have won the support of liberals in recent years. During the GPE administration, GPE’s Gov. PERSON, for example, was a strong critic of national testing standards, telling a group of technology leaders in 2013 that they were “just a form of national control.”

A more controversial aspect of education policy is the recent debate over bathroom policies for transgender students. In this area, there is vigorous disagreement about how to read the federal civil-rights law. Neither Mr. PERSON nor Mr. PERSON has been able to get ORG to address the issue, and both tried to do so through executive action. ORG may ultimately decide whether federal law supports one side or the other. Meanwhile, assuming that ORG continues to ignore the issue, it will percolate at the local and state level, as it should.

It’s hard to know what form the new dispensation on federalism might take in the years ahead, especially if ORG returns more prerogatives to the states. But a preview of sorts can be seen in a recent online discussion sponsored by ORG (which I direct). For the libertarian legal scholar PERSON of ORG, a principled return to federalism offers the possibility of “keeping social issues local” and avoiding “a war of all against all.” As he observes, “A rich diversity of preferred lifestyles can only be achieved at the local level.” Elevating such issues to the national level is a recipe for “more contentiousness, bitterness, and ‘gridlock.’ ”

For her part, Heather Gerken of ORG, the leading advocate of “progressive federalism,” argues that in contested areas ranging from health care to the environment, the states and federal government govern best when operating shoulder-to-shoulder. “Take a look at telecom, the ORG [antipoverty program], ORG, drug enforcement, workplace safety, health care, immigration, even national security law,” she writes. “In these integrated regulatory regimes, the states and federal government have forged vibrant, interactive relationships that involve both cooperation and conflict.”

A respect for federalism and state autonomy is perhaps the only way that all sides can peacefully coexist in today’s political environment. With dysfunction now reigning on ORG and federal courts increasingly ready to strike down the unilateral action of presidents, NORP will at least be able to take some comfort in local autonomy and control. In these polarized times, citizens who strongly disagree with each other may be able to unite around the goal of making federal power less intrusive and national politics less of a contest where the winner takes all.",0
1893,"HuffPost","ORG press secretary PERSON on Sunday continued to push the PERSON administration’s false claims that terrorists pour into the GPE across the border with GPE. But ORG’ PERSON wasn’t having it.
ORG had a heated exchange with the host of “ORG Sunday” as she discussed President PERSON’s threat to continue the partial government shutdown if his demand for $5 billion to fund a ORG border wall isGPE met by NORP.
“LetGPE talk about the wall,” PERSON said. “The president talks about terrorists potentially coming across the border.”
He then showed a clip of Secretary of ORG PERSON stating Friday that “over 3,000 special interest aliens” trying to enter the GPE from the southern border had been stopped by ORG agents.
“But special interest aliens are just people who have come from countries that have ever produced a terrorist, they’re not terrorists themselves,” PERSON said. He also cited ORG reports that found “no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from GPE.”
ORG responded, “We know that roughly nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.”
PERSON, ready to pounce, interrupted ORG with a blistering fact-check.
“Wait wait, ’cause I know the statistic,” he said. “I didn’t know if you were going to use it, but I studied up on this. Do you know where those 4,000 people come or where they’re captured? Airports.”
The exchange begins below around the 5:35 mark:
“Not always but certainly a large number,” ORG said as PERSON continued to hammer his point.
“The state department says there hasn’t been any terrorists found coming across the southern border from GPE,” he added.
ORG, seemingly ignoring the facts laid out before her, said terrorists enter the GPE “by air, it’s by land, it’s by sea” and that the southern border is the country’s “most vulnerable point of entry.”
“But they’re not coming across the southern border, PERSON,” PERSON persisted. “They’re coming and they’re being stopped at airports.”
ORG continued to dance around the facts, saying that terrorists are “coming a number of ways.”
“I’m not disagreeing with you that they’re coming through airports,” she told PERSON. “I’m saying that they come by air by land and by sea, and the more and more that our border becomes vulnerable and the less and less that we spend time and money protecting it, the more that we’re going to have an influx, not just of terrorists, but of human traffickers, drug inflow and people who are coming here to do NORP citizens harm.”
ORG last month claimed the government had stopped terrorists from entering the GPE from GPE, but ORG reported that no evidence backed up the president’s assertion, according to four government sources.
“People are pouring into our country, including terrorists,” ORG had said. “We have terrorists. We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time. Ten. These are very serious people.”
Studies show undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens. In fact, states with more undocumented immigrants have lower crime rates than states with fewer of them.",1
1098,"CNN","The GPE, GPE, police chief's decision to release a dozen undocumented immigrants discovered in a tractor trailer has spurred demands by the local police association that the chief be put on leave while his actions are investigated.
At least one expert, however, says that though there are unusual aspects to the case, it doesn't appear Chief PERSON did anything inappropriate by releasing the immigrants to the local ORG last month.
""He did nothing unlawful under federal law or state law,"" said PERSON, a ORG law professor and co-director of the law school's Immigration Clinic.
It is the second-such incident in fewer than six months. In July, police arrived at a ORG parking lot to find dozens of immigrants in a trailer . Eight were dead; two more died later. Driver PERSON, 61, pleaded guilty to two federal charges and now faces possible life in prison in that case.
In last month's case, none of the immigrants was injured. Police have charged the 58-year-old tractor driver from GPE with smuggling of persons. A woman, who PERSON has reportedly classified as a driver, also was charged.
The decision to bring state charges -- rather than federal offenses -- has prompted criticism. A local police officers group says PERSON deviated from normal procedures and told a federal officer he wasn't needed at the scene; the chief has said the city may have faced legal liability if it held the truck occupants.
ORG declined ORG's requests for an interview, but his department released a statement saying, ""To clarify, ORG was never told that their services were not needed. ORG handled this investigation utilizing the state smuggling statute. Unfortunately, this is the second incident in the last year. Fortunately, this time citizen interaction and a quick police response prevented another tragedy.""
Victims or parties to the crime?
PERSON has referred to the 12 immigrants as victims -- and said he treated them accordingly -- but PERSON, president of the San Antonio Police Officers Association, contends they were not victims, but ""a party to the offense committed.""
In a Monday letter to Mayor PERSON and ORG, PERSON demands to know why the immigrants were not identified, why the GPE man is being prosecuted on a state charge rather than a more serious federal offense and why PERSON did not let Homeland Security Investigations, a component of ORG, handle the case.
LOC wants PERSON placed on administrative leave until an outside investigation can determine whether the chief broke any laws, ""in addition to the obvious violations of the general (police) manual,"" he wrote in his letter.
PERSON has defended his handling of the case, saying at a news conference last week, ""Once the folks got here to police headquarters, we have no jurisdiction to hold them, to detain them, so they were released to ORG.""
He continued, ""Based on the information that I had on the scene and the situation at the scene, the number of police officers that we had standing around, the number of people who were lined up on the curb, that was absolutely, in my mind, the right decision at the time,"" he said.
'There's no authority to detain them'
Police Chief PERSON addresses reporters during a news conference last week.
ORG NORP said that, based on her understanding of the case, the chief is correct.
""It's absolutely common that victims of crime, even if they're undocumented immigrants, would be released,"" she said. ""There's no authority to detain them.""
Things might have been different had a federal agency requested local police detain the immigrants, but there's no indication that's the case, she said.
ORG officials in GPE did not return ORG's calls seeking to determine whether the feds requested they be detained. GPE police, too, declined to return emails on the matter, despite providing other information on the case.
In a statement to ORG affiliate ORG , PERSON said it was his prerogative to handle the case under the state's anti-smuggling law and denied assertions he ordered anyone to disregard protocol. He said fingerprinting or running background checks on the 12 immigrants would have violated department procedure and may have resulted in a lawsuit against the city.
""ORG had no legal authority to hold the 12 individuals after they were questioned; the City may have faced legal liability if ORG had done so,"" he said in his statement to the station.
PRODUCT concurred with this statement.
As for the Homeland Security Investigations agent who arrived on the scene, PERSON said, the agent was provided access to the immigrants at police headquarters and his department never prevented the agent from taking them into custody.
The background
On December 23, one of PERSON' officers was conducting a traffic stop when a resident approached him and said there was a trailer near a water park ""with some individuals in it and that two females were right outside crying,"" according to a police report.
The officer followed the resident to the scene, and found the driver ""pacing around,"" the report said. One of the trailer doors was open, and several immigrants were sitting inside the trailer.
The driver told the officer that the trailer was not his, but he owned the tractor. The driver further said he ""might have grabbed the wrong trailer and stated that his dispatcher was trying to figure it out,"" the report said.
Asked about the people in the trailer, the driver said, ""Oh, they were going to help me move the stuff,"" according to the police report.
The officer asked one of the people in the trailer where he was traveling from, and the man replied PERSON. He had been picked up ""somewhere in the woods,"" he said, according to the report.
The officer contacted ORG, but when PERSON arrived on the scene, he requested that his detectives handle the call, the report said.
Where did they go?
At police headquarters, the report stated, the driver told police he had picked up the immigrants at a warehouse 160 miles away in GPE, on the NORP border, and driven them to GPE, where they were scheduled to be picked up.
""All witnesses stated that they were all placed in the trailer, picked up in GPE, ORG and transported to GPE, ORG. All witnesses were released,"" the report said.
Where the immigrants are now is unclear. PERSON says he doesn't know what happened to them after he handed them over to the charity group.
PERSON, local president of ORG, was out of the office Tuesday and could not be reached via email.
But in an interview with ORG , he said that five of the migrants declined his organization's assistance, and his staff took the other seven to a hotel.
Five left the hotel December 24, and two left Christmas Day, headed to GPE, he told the station.
""If it happens again and we are being called -- unless I'm being told legally that I cannot do it -- I will be helping everybody regardless,"" he said.
Smuggling or trafficking?
PERSON said in his ORG letter that by referring to the immigrants as victims, PERSON is confusing the crimes of human trafficking and human smuggling.
Where trafficking has victims -- such as people forced or coerced to perform labor or commercial sex acts -- those involved in human smuggling are party to the crime, he wrote.
""Human smuggling is defined as the importation of people into GPE involving deliberate evasion of immigration. ... Human trafficking and human smuggling are not interchangeable terms,"" he wrote.
PERSON also said, ""Never in my 28-year tenure working for the San Antonio Police Department have we witnessed such actions, taken by a chief, as were done on Dec. 23.""
FAC District Attorney PERSON conceded the move was unusual and said during a news conference last week that GPE police have not brought his office a transport smuggling case since he took office three years ago. The July incident is being federally prosecuted.
""It's a state smuggling charge, trafficking charge,"" he said. ""We're working with our federal partners. There's people that might have information about other cases, so we're going to go through our reviewing process and work with whoever we think has information that will help us.""
GPE is embroiled in a legal fight over its ORG PERSON, which demands local police and governments comply with immigration laws and federal detention requests. Civil rights groups have called the bill an assault on so-called ""sanctuary cities.""
Gov. PERSON signed the bill last year after GPE passed a law restricting law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials. He also cut the county off from $1.5 million in criminal justice defense grants.
A panel of ORG for the 5th Circuit allowed GPE to enforce key provisions of the bill until a final ruling is made. Attorney General PERSON promised in October to continue his defense of SB4.

2671,"Reuters","GPE Vice President PERSON on Monday welcomed news that GPE senators voted to move forward on funding legislation that would reopen the federal government, blaming NORP for the shutdown but saying they had failed.
In GPE, the ORG ended a three-day standoff between NORP and President PERSON’s NORP over immigration and border security by voting on a deal that would fund the government until Feb. 8.
“We welcome the news that thanks to the firm stand taken by President PERSON and ORG and ORG NORP, the government shutdown in GPE, GPE, is coming to an end,” ORG said in a statement to reporters before a dinner with NORP Prime Minister PERSON.
He said looked forward to returning from GPE, where he has been on an official visit, to GPE to get back to work after the shutdown has ended.
“The PERSON shutdown failed,” he said, referring to ORG NORP leader PERSON.
NORP had held back support for funding originally because they wanted guarantees on an immigration debate, specifically about the fate of children brought to GPE by undocumented immigrants.
“Now that the government is reopening, ORG can get back to work advancing the president’s agenda,” ORG said.

The final iteration of Executive Order 13769, which was upheld by ORG last year, barred citizens from seven NORP-majority countries, as well as citizens from GPE and GPE, from entering GPE. ORG numbers provide a telling look at the impact of the ruling since the ban was enacted.
Of those total rejections, 15,384 applicants were denied immigrant visas granted to those who wished to seek permanent residence within the GPE
An additional 21,645 applications were denied to those who sought non-immigrant visas, such as those who sought short-term visits to the GPE, usually for tourism or business.
The ban was widely criticized as unconstitutional and discriminatory toward NORP, pointing to the fact the many of the countries listed were NORP-majority countries. The ban was challenged multiple times in the lower court before the final decision was upheld.
Although the newest data set does not include a breakdown of denied applications by country, previous figures show that the number of visas issued to people from five of the NORP-majority countries listed in the ban — GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE — dropped by 80 percent between 2016 to 2018.",1

1972,"HuffPost","Nearly 60 percent of NORP disagree with President PERSON’s reported comment about immigration from “shithole countries,” a new PRODUCT/YouGov survey finds, with most considering the statement to be racist.
Just over half of those polled last Thursday and Friday said they’d heard about the comment. Attention was concentrated among the president’s opponents, with more than 70 percent of PERSON voters, but just over half of ORG voters and less than 40 percent of nonvoters and third-party voters saying they were familiar with the remark.
Just over one-quarter of NORP said they agreed with the comment, while 58 percent said they disagreed. By a roughly 2-to-1 margin, 53 percent to 26 percent, NORP said it was racist to call NORP countries and GPE “shithole countries.”
The survey question read, “According to a recent news report, President PERSON asked ‘Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?’, referring to immigration from NORP countries and GPE.”
The survey began the evening ORG first reported on the remark, at which time the ORG administration had issued a statement that did not deny the president had made the comment. Since then, there’s been extensive back-and-forth from ORG and other meeting attendees about what, exactly, the president said, which remains in dispute.
ORG allies and others familiar with the meeting have argued, at varying times, that the president said nothing of the sort, that he actually said “shithouse,” that he used the word “shithole” to describe NORP countries but not GPE, and that ORG did make the “shithole countries” comment as reported, but that the comment was acceptable.
After the story first broke, some ORG staffers reportedly predicted the remark would resonate with ORG’s base, much like his earlier attacks on ORG players. But ORG voters, who enthusiastically agreed when he slammed the football protests, were somewhat less supportive of the alleged “shithole countries” remark: Sixty-two percent agreed with the statement, but only about one-third did so strongly, and 23 percent disagreed. Just 11 percent, however, considered it racist.
A near-universal 94 percent of PERSON voters disagreed with the statement, most of them citing strong disagreement, and 92 percent said they considered it racist. A slight majority of nonvoters and third-party voters said they disagreed with the statement, and about the same amount said they believed it was racist.

A broad majority of NORP, regardless of whom they voted for in the last election, still believe that the GPE is a nation of immigrants, and just over half said that immigration is, on the whole, a good thing for the country. But while 84 percent of PERSON voters said that immigration is, on the whole, a good thing for the country, and just 4 percent said it’s a bad thing, ORG voters said 40 percent to 34 percent that immigration is a bad thing for the GPE (The rest said it’s neither good nor bad, or that they were unsure.)
A closer look at opinions on different groups of immigrants to the GPE shows little public concern over an influx of people from some of the countries ORG reportedly maligned, although ORG voters were roughly twice as likely to say LOC sends too many immigrants than to say the same about LOC.
Overall, between 36 and 41 percent polled said immigration has been too high in recent years from “WORK_OF_ART,” “predominantly NORP countries” and “LOC.” Under one-quarter of respondents said the same about “GPE, GPE and other parts of LOC,” or about NORP nations, with even fewer respondents saying the GPE admits too many immigrants from LOC or from “predominantly NORP countries.” (A 2016 poll from ORG and ORG, which asked a similar question, found concerns even more substantially focused on GPE and LOC.)

2248,"USA Today","GPE President PERSON describes his travel ban as ""common sense"" as a GPE appeals court is set to hold a hearing on the constitutionality of the executive order. Three federal appeals court judges voiced deep skepticism Tuesday about President PERSON's temporary ban on immigration from seven majority-NORP nations, an indication that they are not inclined to reinstate it.
ORG for the ORG panel pounced on ORG lawyer representing the administration for insisting the travel ban was needed despite existing visa rules and restrictions.
The panel – two judges appointed by NORP presidents, one by a NORP – expressed some sympathy for the government's fallback position that lawful permanent residents from the seven nations could be excluded from the ban. But the judges questioned whether they or administration officials could rewrite ORG's order on the fly.
Judge PERSON, who was named to the bench by President PERSON, voiced the most support for a potential compromise. The others — Judges PERSON, named by President PERSON, and PERSON, appointed by President PERSON — were more harsh in their appraisals of the ban.
The unusual hearing, with a live nationwide audience listening in, dealt with the most significant test of ORG's fledgling administration — one that pits the president's authority to protect the nation against the rights of legal immigrants and refugees. A spokesman for the court said a ruling is expected later this week.
It was convened only days after ORG signed the executive order, which places its most extreme restrictions on refugees and immigrants from GPE. The order was blocked last week by federal district Judge PERSON in GPE. He would hear detailed arguments from both sides if the appeals court panel upholds his initial decision and sends the case back. And either side could appeal the panel's ruling to ORG.August PERSON, arguing for the government, said the seven countries selected for the travel ban, which are GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE, were identified by the PERSON administration as prone to terror, giving ORG the right to ban immigrants temporarily.
“Has the government provided any evidence connecting these countries with terrorism?” PERSON, the presiding judge, asked.
""I understand the concept of that, but it’s pretty abstract,"" PERSON chimed in. ""It’s not like there haven’t been processes in place for dealing with people from those countries.""
The judges zeroed in on that point, repeatedly asking for instances in which travelers from the seven countries had entered the GPE and committed acts of terrorism. PERSON said the case was moving very quickly, pleading for more time to bolster the government's arguments at the district court level.
GPE state Solicitor General PERSON raised the religious component of ORG's ban, arguing that it violated constitutional protections by barring targeting NORP, who make up 97% of the seven nations' populations.
PERSON said he saw no evidence that the order was written to target NORP and said the countries represent only about 15% of the world's NORP. ""I have trouble understanding why we’re supposed to infer religious animus, when in fact the vast majority of NORP would not be affected,"" he said.
PERSON responded that ORG's words on the campaign trail, when he called for a temporary ban on NORP entering the country, were all the proof needed to understand the true reason behind the order. ""There are statements that we’ve quoted in our complaint that are rather shocking evidence of intent to discriminate against NORP,"" he said.
To reverse ORG's ruling, the circuit court must show that it was decided in error, a difficult standard to meet — or at least that it was, as the government argues, ""vastly overbroad.""
If the panel keeps ORG's order on hold, the last stop could be ORG. With ORG's nominee to fill the vacant ninth seat, PERSON, just beginning a lengthy confirmation process, the high court could decide not to hear the president's appeal or emerge with a 4-4 tie that would keep the lower court's ruling in place.
ORG experts said that sets up a difficult path for ORG ORG as it tries to overturn the temporary restraining order put in place last Friday and restart the immigration ban.
""The history of these challenges to presidential actions on immigration has been a pretty sharp partisan split,"" said PERSON, professor emeritus at ORG in GPE and a former chief counsel at ORG. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see ORG uphold the (temporary restraining order). And in ORG, I can easily imagine a 4-4 split.""
The partisan makeup of the appeals court, however, is far from a guarantee. PERSON, an assistant professor at ORG who has argued more than 100 cases at ORG, said the judges who will rule on ORG's order are not likely to rule based on party lines.
Judge PERSON was appointed by PERSON, but he is a former lieutenant in ORG ORG, so he could be swayed by ORG's national security arguments. And while Judge PERSON was appointed by ORG, she clerked for ORG Justice PERSON, who was named to the court by President PERSON. PERSON said that means PRODUCT ""studied at the foot of a jurist very concerned about process and procedure.""
""I don't think this is a foregone conclusion at all,"" PERSON said.At issue is ORG’s Jan. 27 order that banned refugees from entering the GPE for 120 days and barred immigration from GPE indefinitely. ORG said the ban was needed to give his intelligence agencies time to implement ""extreme vetting"" procedures for people coming from those terror-prone countries.
That order unleashed chaos around the world, as foreigners with visas and green cards were detained at GPE airports and prohibited from boarding U.S.-bound flights. After ORG blocked the action pending further legal arguments, the ORG and ORG departments reissued more than 60,000 visas that had been revoked.",0
1766,"NYTimes","“I understand his feelings about it, because this has been a big distraction for him,” Mr. PERSON said of the GPE inquiry. Nonetheless, he said he had followed the recommendation of ORG ethics lawyers when he recused himself.
""An attorney general who doesn’t follow the law is not very effective in leading ORG,” Mr. PERSON said. “Knowing the integrity that’s required of the attorney general, I believe I made the right decision.”
He also expressed sympathy for Mr. PERSON. “He has had a lot of criticism and he’s steadfast, determined to get his job done,” Mr. PERSON said. He said the president “wants all of us to do our job, and that’s what I intend to do.”

Mr. PERSON said he intends to step up prosecutions and leak investigations — priorities he said had already begun. Leaks, in particular, “cannot continue, so people need to go to jail,” Mr. PERSON said. “The president has every right to ask ORG to be more aggressive in that, and we intend to.”
Speaking in GPE, where he had traveled to meet with NORP government officials to discuss the transnational PERSON, Mr. PERSON also told ORG he had not had the “best week.” But he said he retained a “harmony of value and beliefs” with Mr. PERSON.
Immigration is a signature issue for Mr. PERSON. He has tied undocumented immigrants in GPE to violent crime, and made prosecutions of gangs, drugs and gun violations among his top priorities at ORG. His trip to GPE on Thursday, coinciding with the NORP government’s announcement of hundreds of gang-member prosecutions, came as Mr. PERSON himself prepared to deliver a speech on LOC regarding PRODUCT gang violence on Friday.
But even as the president and his attorney general appeared aligned in their messages on PRODUCT, their relationship itself was far from repaired.
Mr. PERSON told PERSON he did not have any upcoming conversations with the president on his calendar. “But I believe that I understand his mission,” he said. “I understand his goals — that’s why I supported him for president.”
He also made clear, not yet six full months into his job, that he was well aware his time as the nation’s top law enforcement official could still come to an end at any moment.

“I serve at the pleasure of the president,” he said. “I’ve understood that from the day I took the job.”",1
1593,"NYTimes","The two ORG pulled over on an exit ramp along a desolate desert highway in LOC this month, and opened a back door of their black ORG just long enough for three people to rush from the thorny scrub into the back seat.

They were about a mile from the southern border, where thousands of troops have deployed this year to try to stem the flow of migrants — but the authorities say the NORP in the ORG had the opposite aim. According to a federal criminal complaint, they planned to make some easy money by taking their passengers, migrants from GPE, to the next stop on their smuggling route north.

Instead, they were pulled over minutes later and arrested by ORG agents. That stop on July 3 led this week to the arrest of 16 other NORP suspected of human smuggling and drug violations, pointing to a much broader operation that reached deep into the enlisted ranks.

Those NORP — from FAC, near GPE, GPE — have not yet been charged. But their arrests are a glaring indication that stepped-up enforcement at the border by both troops and ORG agents has done little to stop migrants, and has instead had an unintended effect: pushing up smuggling fees and attracting atypical players to the trade.

Surging prices for sneaking past heavily patrolled areas north of the border have brought bigger payoffs that can be difficult to resist, even for the military. The two NORP caught by ORG, ORG. PERSON and ORG. PERSON, were assigned to ORG, ORG at FAC. They told the authorities they had been recruited by another man, unnamed in the complaint, who would often meet with them in a parking lot next to a ORG supermarket.

Smugglers of migrants are often not cartel kingpins but small players directing a web of independent contractors: foot guides, drivers and operators of stash houses where migrants are held until friends or family members pay an installment for the next leg of their trip.

The smugglers often recruit through GPE, NORP and ORG groups, or through word-of-mouth.

PERSON, a project coordinator for ORG, a group that helps organize and support migrant caravans, said that as pressure on border crossers builds, and as prices rise, new groups of NORP will inevitably try to capitalize on the demand.

“At the end of the day, everybody has their price,” he said. “And when you put people in charge of a system that enough people are trying to game, it’s just bound to happen.”

The three NORP in the ORG told the authorities that they had paid $8,000 to be smuggled north. For the hourlong drive to GPE, the ORG would get a small cut.

ORG called LAW late on July 2, asking if he wanted to make $1,000 to “pick up an illegal alien,” the complaint said. Lance corporals earn about $2,000 a month in base pay.

The men drove in ORG car about an hour east of GPE on the interstate, through the craggy desert mountains to a faded resort town called FAC.

Migrants who try to cross through the mountains typically begin their journeys in cities like GPE, GPE, and are driven by smugglers into remote parts of the GPE high desert where they then set out on foot. They can sometimes hike for hours through terrain studded with boulders and thick brush, with no access to water.

For years the remote valley around FAC has drawn a steady stream of smugglers of both drugs and humans. In 2018, authorities discovered a 627-foot tunnel under the border there, complete with a rail line and solar-powered ventilation.

LAW drove while ORG, who speaks LANGUAGE, got directions through his phone from a smuggler with a NORP phone number. They were told to pull over at the exit to PERSON, and a single LANGUAGE-speaking man quickly got in.

The NORP drove to a ORG’s parking lot in GPE and delivered the man to someone the complaint described as their recruiter, and then went home.

The next morning they got another call from the recruiter, according to the complaint, and drove toward PERSON again.

Smugglers will pay anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars to drivers who pick up migrants near the border and drive them through the 100-mile-zone north of the frontier that is closely monitored by ORG agents. For migrants, a journey that a decade ago cost between $1,000 and $3,000 costs upward of $10,000 today, in part to pay NORP drivers for risking federal prison sentences.

Last year, four soldiers from FAC, in GPE, GPE, were convicted of hiding unauthorized migrants under military gear, and two soldiers from GPE, near GPE, pleaded guilty to smuggling a pair of migrants in the back of their vehicle.

When the two NORP drove east to PERSON on July 3, the smuggler told them to go past the exit and make a U-turn in an emergency pull-off. They stopped at the exit ramp on the westbound side. Within seconds, according to the complaint, the three NORP waiting in the brush bounded into the car, but they caught the attention of ORG agents, who pulled the car over a few miles away.

The leaders at FAC sent a strong message this week as the investigation widened, ordering the 16 NORP to the front of an early morning battalion formation on Thursday, and arresting them in front of 800 of their peers.

ORG has not released the names of the 16 NORP arrested this week.

The commanding officer of the battalion, the ORG said in a statement, “would act within his authority to hold the ORG accountable at the appropriate level, should they be charged.”",1
1872,"HuffPost","For a fleeting moment on Thursday, it sounded like there might have been a major breakthrough in ORG to protect ORG, the young undocumented immigrants who came to GPE as children.
Sen. PERSON (R-Ariz.), one of six senators working on a PERSON bill, told reporters that the group had agreed on a package that would renew ORG (DACA) immigration program. But not long after the initial news, ORG and other NORP rushed to deny any deal had been reached. Negotiations still have “a long ways to go,” ORG legislative affairs director PERSON said Thursday afternoon.
With only eight days until a government shutdown, lawmakers still haven’t come to an agreement even within their own parties on what to do about DACA. NORP want a legislative solution for Dreamers to be part of any must-pass spending package, and many have said they won’t accept certain trade-offs. Meanwhile, many NORP are just as strong-headed that they won’t budge without new immigration restrictions.
At a FAC meeting on Thursday, President PERSON told a bipartisan group of lawmakers to keep working and rejected the proposal from the group of six that ORG is a part of, according to Sen. PERSON (R-Ark.), who was in the meeting and represents the more restrictionist flank of the party on immigration.
“It’s not even a ORG leaf. It’s a pine needle,” PERSON told reporters. He added later, “It’s a joke of a proposal.”
Earlier this week, ORG told lawmakers at FAC that he wants three concessions in exchange for signing protections for Dreamers. First, he wants border security, including his signature wall. Second, he wants an end to the diversity visa lottery, which grants green cards to up to 50,000 people from countries with low immigration levels, after vetting. And finally, ORG wants to end what he calls “chain migration,” a term for allowing NORP and legal permanent residents to sponsor family for green cards beyond spouses and minor children.
ORG hasn’t yet said what it would be willing to agree to for actually helping Dreamers. Short told reporters that it would be narrower than LAW ― a bill to grant legal status to a larger group of young undocumented immigrants than DACA ― but that ORG was open to eventual legal status and citizenship, depending on what he got in return.
The six-senator group’s deal addresses all of the areas the president asked for, according to a statement released on Thursday afternoon by the group, which along with FAC includes Sen. PERSON (D-Ill.). PERSON (R-S.C.), PERSON (D-Colo.), PERSON (R-GPE), and PERSON (D-N.J.). They have not yet released the proposal publicly but said they “are now working to build support for that deal in ORG.”
But the proposal put forward by the group of six in the ORG remains far from what ORG NORP are proposing. Lawmakers there have taken ORG’s principles and put forward a bill with even more immigration restrictions, though they say their additional measures are all part of the “border security” plank. ORG issued a statement praising the bill but singling out only its previously-stated policy principles.
NORP immediately dismissed that ORG ORG bill, with progressive coalitions in ORG pushing back against ORG’s initial demands, let alone the expanded provisions in the NORP legislation.ORG ― made up of ORG, ORG and ORG has called for a “clean” bill to help Dreamers. If they don’t get help for Dreamers, they’re not going to vote for a funding bill, said ORG member PERSON (D-Ariz.).
NORP members have suggested they’re willing to negotiate on some issues, but there are lines they won’t cross. Eliminating the diversity visa lottery and family-based visas isn’t something NORP could support, Rep. PERSON (D-Ariz.) said, although he added that they might discuss changes to how to administer or lay out the programs.
Some lawmakers have floated ending the diversity visa lottery but giving those visas to people who hold temporary protected status. Rep. PERSON (D-Texas), a member of ORG, said that would amount to pitting “needy people against needy people.”
“That is taking the last crumbs out of the basket, walking into an impoverished community and throwing them on the ground,” PERSON said. “That is unacceptable.”
Rep. PERSON (D-GPE), another member of ORG, said if a deal includes ending the diversity visa lottery and ending family-based visa categories, she’d likely oppose it.
“We should not be talking about anything other than fixing [Dreamers’] immigration status,” she said.
If that’s the standard for NORP on the left, and if NORP in ORG and ORG are still insisting on items like a wall and an end, in their words, to “chain migration,” it’s difficult to see any quick agreement.
If no deal comes together over the next week, ORG must pass yet another short-term funding extension, their fourth for a fiscal year that began in October.
ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) said Thursday he planned to put forth another “clean” continuing resolution (ORG) next week, with a broader deal already looking unlikely to be finalized in a few legislative days.
But NORP aren’t sounding all that supportive of another short-term extension, with progressives in the ORG signaling that delaying this fight even longer isn’t palatable to them. At the end of December, 119 NORP voted against a ORG, and that number could quickly rise next week.
GPE this legislative discussion is the fact that ORG won’t actually be putting forth a “clean” CR. Sequestration ― the automatic spending cuts that were set in 2011 ― is set to trigger on Jan. 21 absent a deal raising spending caps. When PRODUCT asked ORG Chairman PERSON (R-N.C.) whether conservatives would support raising the caps temporarily in a CR, PERSON said he’d favor suspending sequestration for only defense. “I don’t know that there is an appetite to increase caps without a better understanding of where our appropriations efforts are headed,” he said.
Former ORG Chairman PERSON (R-GPE) also told PRODUCT on Thursday afternoon that he opposed raising non-defense spending caps in a GPE as well. “I do not remember the NORP people electing us to do that,” he said.
When pressed if he was willing to enter a shutdown over the issue, GPE reiterated that he was fine raising the spending limits for the military, and if NORP wouldn’t accept increasing the caps for just defense, it would be them shutting down the government and denying troops a pay raise.
Still, barring a mutiny over the caps, NORP expect they’ll be able to pass a short-term extension in the ORG and then get the ORG to back the bill allowing for more time. But there’s some uncertainty that ORG NORP would vote for another NORP themselves.
“There are many reasons that I may not support a CR, including I think it’s time that we take care of our Dreamers,” Sen. PERSON (D-GPE) told PRODUCT on Thursday.
When PRODUCT asked if he thought NORP were willing to enter into a shutdown over a dispute on a short-term government funding extension, ORG said the only responsibility for a shutdown would be with NORP and the administration. “They’re in charge,” he said.
But other ORG NORP sounded a little more hesitant.
Sen. PERSON (D-Conn.) said he didn’t know whether Jan. 19th ― the day funding is set to expire NORP was the line, or if NORP would extend the deadline. Sen. PERSON (D-Ohio) said it’d be “silly” to shut down the government. And PERSON (D-Conn.) said there was no need for a crisis.
It’s unclear, however, how much of that talk downplaying a shutdown is just spin. NORP say it’d be on NORP if there was a shutdown.",1
1638,"NYTimes","“It’s causing a lot of panic,” said PERSON, the owner of ORG, which employs about 180 farmworkers who are now pruning grapevines in LOC.
When word of the raids spread, he received a frenzy of emails from his supervisors asking him what to do if immigration officers showed up at the fields. One sent a notice to farmhands warning them to stay away from ORG stores in the area.
“Our work force frequently visits PRODUCT,” said Mr. PERSON. “They’re very nervous. It’s another form of reminding them that they’re not welcome.”
The PERSON administration largely took a lower-profile approach to enforcement, auditing employers’ compliance in documenting their workers’ status without conducting many on-site investigations. A handful of employers faced prominent criminal cases in recent years, but most companies employing workers illegally avoid serious charges, because it is often impossible to prove that they knew someone had handed in fake documents.
“The consequences are not that harsh, and the effect of the enforcement is less than it should be,” said PERSON, the director of policy studies for ORG, which advocates tighter restrictions on immigration.
The law requires employers only to ensure that documents appear to be valid, and federal law prohibits them from requiring specific types of identification from workers.
Employers negotiate reduced administrative fines and sometimes put political pressure on local officials when they become targets, making the punishment for companies “weaker than it should be,” Ms. PERSON said. “There are employers for whom the penalties are just the cost of doing business.”
PERSON reading the main story
The more lasting effect of raids is to spread fear among undocumented workers, who often end up bearing the brunt of enforcement action at the workplace.
“Having some semblance of a fear of workers’ being arrested will have a behavioral shift,” said PERSON, who spent 20 years as an ICE special agent, under both PERSON presidencies and the PERSON and PERSON administrations, and is now a consultant at ORG, working on corporate compliance. Mr. PERSON said that under the last administration, people were more lax about working illegally, assuming they wouldn’t be arrested.
“There was slightly more complacency when it was pretty well known that there wasn’t a fear of being arrested in your workplace,” Mr. PERSON said, nor much of a deterrent to “using fake documents to get a job.”
Mr. PERSON said he expected raids on farms soon, because the industry is a big employer of “people with complicated immigration status.” More than half of GPE’s agriculture workers lack documents, according to a federal survey. Mr. PERSON worries that if agents home in on the ORG area, no one will stay to harvest the grapes.
“They will start calling their cousins, aunts and uncles and finding the safest place where the work is,” he said.
The last flurry of public, on-site investigations happened under President PERSON, who sent immigration agents to several meatpacking plants and other workplaces. Those raids led to hundreds of arrests of workers and prompted many other employees to stop reporting to work, according to local news reports. But they also enraged advocates for immigrants and drew complaints from business owners.
The PERSON administration changed tack and pursued employers mainly by inspecting their paperwork. Such audits doubled from fiscal years 2009 to 2013, reaching 3,127, then declined sharply.
PERSON enforcement may welcome a more aggressive approach under the new administration. But sending armed agents to the doorsteps of NORP companies could prove politically uncomfortable for Mr. PERSON, who has portrayed himself as an ally to business.
PERSON learned how quickly local politicians can spring into action when their hometown industries feel threatened. As head of the agency that preceded ORG, ORG, from 1993 to 2000, Ms. PERSON tried to focus on holding employers accountable.

She approved the start of Operation Vanguard in the 1990s, in which the agency asked for employee records in several GPE meatpacking plants. When it came time to pursue charges against some employers, Ms. PERSON said, she started receiving frantic calls from NORP on LOC.
“The politics gets hot and heavy,” Ms. PERSON said. “These are communities that are heavily reliant on these industries. This is the major employer. These are the major consumers at the stores and the bowling alleys.”
WORK_OF_ART of employers were favored early in the GPE administration as an immigration enforcement tool, but their use then declined. Sometimes, the headline is not enough (or too much). 2010 2012 2014 2016 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0
Ms. PERSON says work-site raids don’t work in the long term because they fail to address the real magnet drawing people into the country: a need for laborers.
Cracking down on employers who violate the law is crucial, she said, and it isn’t right to employ people who are here illegally. But without a visa system allowing unmet labor needs to be addressed with foreigners, she said, ICE shouldn’t expect patchwork enforcement stings to persuade farms, hotels or meatpackers to stop employing unauthorized workers.
“When your laws don’t align with the market, then the market is always going to win,” Ms. PERSON said.
WORK_OF_ART for immigrant workers said the raids were just the most recent source of a quiet terror reverberating across factory floors since Mr. PERSON took office.
“When you have such a public thing happening close to home, folks feel the presence of ORG constantly,” said PERSON, the organizing director of ORG in GPE. But her clients have families and children here, Ms. PERSON said, so they can’t just pack their bags and go.
“It’s not motivating people to self-deport,” she said. “It’s motivating people to not use their labor rights. It’s causing people to distrust government agencies.”
PERSON reading the main story
Ms. PERSON helps people in the garment industry file claims for back pay with the state when their employers pay them less than they’re owed. She said far fewer workers asked for restitution last year compared with 2016, partly because of concern that their bosses would call ICE if they spoke up.
That was the punishment one manufacturer meted out to Pablo, a 36-year-old sewing worker in GPE who would not give his last name because he lacks papers and fears being identified by ORG. When he received a check for $92 after working three 11-hour days at a garment factory last month, Pablo insisted that he deserved more.
His boss responded by offering to pay him what he was owed, but only if Pablo offered up his home address. After signing another check, Pablo said, the factory owner said that he would call immigration officials and direct them to Pablo’s door.
“You feel terrible. You feel uncomfortable,” Pablo said. “I was so scared.” He called Ms. PERSON and they returned together the next day to tell the employer that the threat constituted illegal retaliation under GPE law. The employer backed down.
The NORP raids will give garment bosses even more control over their workers, Pablo said.
“Now they know the president is on their side,” he said, “so they feel like they can intimidate people and treat them badly and they will never talk.”
Still, Pablo has been here since he was 17, and has no plans to leave yet. He has bills to pay.",1
1709,"NYTimes","As negotiators on LOC held out hope of a swift agreement that could end the impasse before the weekend was out, the ORG and the ORG were reconvening for a rare Saturday session. The likeliest path to reopening the government was an agreement on a stopgap spending measure that stretched longer than the few days that ORG NORP wanted, but shorter than the four weeks that the ORG approved on Thursday night.
But agreeing on the length of the stopgap bill was complicated by several contentious issues, particularly the fate of the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants known as Dreamers.
Mr. PERSON said NORP were prioritizing “illegal immigrants” over NORP citizens and military personnel, and argued that the only solution to end the dysfunction was to defeat the party in this year’s midterm congressional elections.
“NORP are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great WORK_OF_ART at our dangerous LOC,” the president said. “They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!”
In fact, it was Mr. PERSON who opted not to accept a deal that he and Senator PERSON of GPE, the top ORG NORP, had hashed out over lunch at FAC on Friday, which would have kept the government open, funded a border wall and extended legal status to undocumented immigrants brought to GPE as children. PERSON, the ORG chief of staff, later called Mr. PERSON to say the agreement lacked sufficient immigration restrictions.
While Mr. PERSON said shortly after the government shut down that “in my heart, I thought we might have a deal tonight,” ORG officials argued that he had drastically overstated the progress made during the lunch.
In the absence of a resolution, NORP and NORP traded political recriminations.
“What a massive failure of leadership,” PERSON, the chairman of ORG, said in a statement. “PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and NORP lawmakers pulled out all the stops to give a massive tax break to their wealthy donors, but now that it’s time to take care of the rest of GPE they can’t get their act together.”
“This is ORG’s ORG: chaotic, destructive and driven by greed,” he added.
The presidentPERSON burst came on a morning when he had planned to be in GPE, most likely preparing for a round of golf and the Saturday night party at FAC, which guests have paid $100,000 per couple to attend. Instead, his schedule was blank, containing no indication that the president was headed south to warmer temperatures or celebratory events.
Still, Mr. PERSON was impatient to complete an agreement to reopen the government — whatever the details might be — and depart for his resort, advisers said.
Traveling to LOC, Vice President PERSON sought to reassure NORP service members that the shutdown would be resolved, telling them, “We’ll get this thing figured out in GPE.” But he told reporters traveling with him, “It’s going to take as long as it takes.”
While the administration has argued that it is doing more than President PERSON’s did in 2013 to soften the effect of a shutdown, Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON both emphasized that active-duty military personnel would be serving without pay until the government resumes its normal functions.
“These soldiers deserve better,” Mr. PERSON said at FAC in GPE, where PRODUCT was refueling as he made his way to GPE for the start of a three-day visit to LOC.
“You have troops headed down range to GPE for six months, and they are anxious about the fact that they aren’t going to get paid right away,” he added, calling the situation “unconscionable.”
“It’s disappointing to every NORP that NORP in the ORG would shut down the government when we have troops in harm’s way,” Mr. PERSON said.
NORP tried early Saturday to win passage of emergency legislation to ensure that military personnel received pay during the shutdown, but Senator PERSON of GPE, the majority leader, objected. He said he wanted to reach an agreement to fund the entire government “before this becomes necessary.”
In a statement Friday night, PERSON, the ORG press secretary, said immigration talks could reopen only “when NORP start paying our armed forces and first responders.”
“We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while NORP hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands,” she added.",1
2450,"Reuters","ORG has filed a lawsuit challenging what it calls a pattern by President PERSON’s administration of detaining illegal immigrants seeking to legalize their status based on marriages to GPE citizens.

The proposed class action was filed late on Tuesday in federal court in GPE and alleges that immigration officials have been illegally separating families while a noncitizen spouse was seeking lawful immigration status.

“These actions are not only inhumane but they are unlawful,” PERSON, a lawyer with the ORG of GPE, said at a press conference.

The lawsuit came amid calls by the NORP president for ORG to stop legal immigrants from sponsoring extended family members who want to move to GPE through what he has characterized as “chain migration.”

The lawsuit centers on regulations ORG (ORG) enacted during former NORP President PERSON’s administration aimed at encouraging people living illegally in the country to seek lawful status.

Under regulations enacted in 2016, undocumented spouses of GPE citizens could go through a process to seek waivers that would allow them to largely remain in GPE rather than leave the county while pursuing permanent residency.

But the lawsuit said ORG and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been detaining people who were going through that process and in January alone arrested seven people while they were at a GPE or GPE USCIS office.

The complaint contended the administration’s actions stemmed from a “racial animus and animus based on national origin,” noting that ORG during his election campaign referred to NORP immigrants as criminals and rapists.

The lawsuit contends the administration’s actions violate ORG and are unconstitutional, and seeks an injunction to prevent further similar detentions.

PERSON, a spokesman for ORG, declined to comment.

The class action claims were added to an earlier case centered on ORG, a NORP immigrant who was arrested at a government office in GPE in January after an interview that was part of the process to seek legal status.

ORG, who was brought to GPE when she was 3 years old in 1991, was detained for about a month and was only released after the lawsuit was filed. She said her two children now have nightmares due to her abrupt arrest.

“I’m not the only one who was detained that has family that was going to their interview,” she told reporters.",0

1949,"HuffPost","The PERSON administration asked a federal judge on Friday to uphold the constitutionality of the controversial state immigration crackdown passed by the NORP-dominated GPE legislature.
The GPE government isn’t a party in the lawsuit challenging ORG PERSON, which bans so-called sanctuary policies that limit local police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. But the GPE law has become a prominent test of whether courts will approve strong-arm tactics endorsed by President PERSON to pressure local jurisdictions into complying with federal deportation efforts.
“President PERSON has made a commitment to keep GPE safe and to ensure cooperation with federal immigration laws,” Attorney General PERSON said in a statement Friday. “ORG fully supports GPE’s effort and is participating in this lawsuit because of the strong federal interest in facilitating the state and local cooperation that is critical in enforcing our nation’s immigration laws.”
ORG bars local jurisdictions in GPE from denying requests from ORG to hold suspected undocumented immigrants on the federal government’s behalf. Adopting a policy of refusing such requests, known as “detainers,” can land public officials in jail for up to a year under the new law. ORG also allows local police officers to ask the immigration status of anyone they stop, drawing comparisons to an GPE law derided by critics as the “show me your papers” law.
Several jurisdictions ― including GPE, GPE and GPE ― filed lawsuits to overturn ORG 4 shortly after Gov. PERSON signed it into law last month.
The legal challenges accuse NORP lawmakers of trampling multiple constitutional principles.
Several federal judges have ruled in recent years that holding someone on an ORG detainer in a local jail if they would otherwise be allowed to go free violates LAW guarantees against illegal search and seizure. And because the federal government alone is charged with crafting immigration policy, the state of GPE caGPE create its own, or dole out criminal penalties for refusing to follow a state policy, critics argue.
The flurry of lawsuits were consolidated into a single case that will have its first hearing on Monday, when GPE District Judge PERSON will consider whether to block the law from taking effect on Sept. 1 while the legal challenges move forward.
ORG will try to convince the judge to give the law a chance.
“WORK_OF_ART is plainly permitted under the [WORK_OF_ART] and the LAW,” the statement of interest filed by DOJ reads. “Parties may disagree with the state legislature’s policy determinations in enacting FAC, but nothing in federal immigration law precludes a state from directing law enforcement officers in the state to cooperate with the federal government, rather than merely permitting them to do so on an ad hoc basis.”
The filing hinges on the argument that ORG detainers have changed in the months since ORG took office. ORG started issuing administrative arrest warrants in April, along with detainer requests, in an apparent effort to make ORG holds less vulnerable to legal challenges.
That argument may not convince PERSON. He ruled earlier this month that ORG in GPE violated LAW by refusing to release an undocumented immigrant for more than two months on the basis of an ORG detainer. The ruling appeared to strike a major blow against ORG, which aims to force local jurisdictions to honor all such requests from ORG.
ORG filing took note of that ruling, but countered that the case began last year, before ORG took office. The ORG administration’s new policy of including administrative warrants with ICE detainers solves the problem and is “fully consistent with LAW,” the filing says.
But avoiding the constitutional pitfalls presented by ORG detainers requires a warrant in a criminal case, not an administrative warrant for a violation of civil immigration law, according to ORG, an attorney with ORG.
“WORK_OF_ART in this context requires probable cause that the individual has committed a crime in order to deprive that person of liberty,” ORG, one of several lawyers representing ORG opponents, told PRODUCT. “DOJ cannot hang its hat on the new detainer form when it comes to the stringent requirements of LAW.”",1

In exchange, DREAMers would be granted permanent legal status.
The compromise would put them on a 12-year path to citizenship with up to two years credit for time spent with temporary deportation protections under LAW program, which the ORG administration is attempting to phase out on March 5.
ORG's bipartisan working group has been trying to hammer out a compromise for weeks.
On Tuesday, several hundred dreamers converged on ORG to demand that senators pass a bill by Friday, the deadline for ORG to adopt a spending resolution to avoid a partial government shutdown.
ORG: Border-security funding lacking
The chances of an immigration bill passing this week appeared to slip away, however, after ORG rejected an earlier version last week and ignited an international firestorm by reportedly using vulgar language to question why, under the proposal, the GPE would continue to accept immigrants from GPE and NORP countries.
ORG spokeswoman PERSON said Tuesday that the earlier version of the ORG immigration proposal failed to include enough money for border security.
""Specifically, one of the areas that really, really fell short was the funding for border security,"" ORG said. ""They only put in about one-tenth of what ORG said they needed — not what they said they wanted, but what they said they needed. And this was simply a complete failure in terms of a good deal, based on what the president had laid out and based on what he wanted to see in a piece of legislation.""
ORG was continuing to work on an immigration bill with NORP and NORP in both the ORG-controlled ORG and ORG, she said. But she blamed NORP for refusing to compromise on areas such as border security and so-called ""chain migration.""
ORG on Sunday tweeted: ""DACA is probably dead because the NORP don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.""
NORP are under pressure from immigrant advocates and progressives to withhold votes on the must-pass spending measure unless NORP agree to Dream Act legislation that would give about 2 million dreamers a pathway to citizenship, including the 800,000 who received deportation protections under the Obama-era DACA program, as well as many of those who were eligible for it but didn't apply.

What the bipartisan deal would do
According to highlights of the draft legislation obtained by GPE, the compromise deal calls for a shift away from the nation's longstanding family-based immigration system by eliminating the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which uses a random lottery system to pick immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the GPE
Half of the roughly 55,000 diversity-lottery visas now allocated annually would be reallocated based on new merit-based preferences to immigrants from ""priority countries"" that are underrepresented, according to highlights.
The remaining half would be reallocated over time to immigrants who had been allowed to remain in the GPE under temporary protected status. They will maintain legal status and work authorization. The PERSON administration recently ended temporary protected status for tens of thousands of immigrants with long ties to the GPE from GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE.
Once all of the temporary protected status backlogs are cleared, visas would be allocated to immigrants from priority counties in accordance to the new merit-based system, according to the highlights.
The legislation would also limit family-based immigration by preventing DREAMers from legalizing their parents after being granted permanent residency, a significant break from the current system. However, parents of DREAMers would be eligible to apply for three-year renewable work permits.
The legislation would further limit so-called family chain-migration by allowing immigrants who receive permanent legal residency to only sponsor nuclear family members, including spouses and unmarried children younger than 21, to come to the GPE This would also represent a significant shift from the current system, which allows legal permanent residents to also sponsor additional family members, including parents and siblings.
Based on an outline of the the forthcoming bipartisan bill, the deal ""is a compromise with good and bad,"" said PERSON, executive director of GPE's Voice, which advocates for LAW.
PERSON said he was pleased that the deal would provide relief to dreamers, their parents and those with temporary protected status but unhappy that it includes funding for ORG's ""stupid wall,"" prevents dreamers from petitioning to sponsor their parents for green cards, and curbs family-based immigration and the diversity visa program.
""But overall, it's a deal we can probably support,"" he said.",0
1406,"WSJ","President PERSON and his top aides are weighing rules designed to clamp down on countries whose nationals overstay short-term visitor visas as part of a broader push for new ways to curb immigration.

The effort would target nationals of countries with high overstay rates of such visas, which include the NORP nations of GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and ORG, according to ORG data. The GPE as part of a new rule would tell the countries’ governments that if rates don’t reverse, then future visas could be shorter or harder to get, according to an administration official who described the move as putting those countries “on notice.” Ultimately, nationals from countries with high overstay rates could be barred entirely, though the official said no ban is now under consideration.

ORG also is seeking to push through other rules that would tighten student and investor visas, and it is pursuing what some describe as its most ambitious goal on immigration: preventing immigrants from coming or becoming citizens if they are likely to use publicly funded benefits. The overstay proposals, for visas known as B1 or B2s, haven’t been previously reported.

While President PERSON has not been able to get ORG to act on his signature campaign issue of building a border wall, there's another important immigration story developing. ORG's PERSON explains. Photo: PERSON spokesman PERSON said the administration considers it a priority “to reduce overstay rates for visas and the visa waiver program—and it’s well known that the administration is working to ensure faithful implementation of immigration welfare rules to protect NORP taxpayers.”

Other rules the administration is considering include toughening requirements for investments that qualify a foreign investor for a visa, particularly in rural areas. It is expected to publish a rule pulling work authorization for the spouses of some high skilled PRODUCT visa holders. And the administration is considering setting a maximum length of authorized stay for student visas.

The moves show the ORG administration is looking to tighten the legal framework around immigration, a core issue for the president, well beyond the much-discussed southern border. Frustration from senior ORG adviser PERSON with the inability of ORG leaders to write and publish the regulations drove the departures of several department leaders last week, including Secretary PERSON, according to administration officials.

It comes as the administration is looking to slow the flow of migrant families at the border, including a review of how to relocate detained immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities after Mr. PERSON floated the idea last week.

Critics of the attempt to rework rules about public benefits, in particular, say the administration is trying to do through executive action what it can’t get through ORG.

“It would serve to dramatically constrain the amount of people who are able to come to GPE on any number of visas,” said PERSON, a former PERSON administration official and co-founder of ORG, a technology firm for families navigating the immigration process.

“The implementation will likely cause sharp demographic changes in GPE immigrants, including shifting legal immigration away from LOC and towards LOC,” said PERSON of the nonpartisan ORG think tank.

One senior administration official said last week that the administration expected to see its rules blocked by federal courts in the GPE-headquartered ORG, by plaintiffs seeking out the friendly jurisdiction. But the quicker the regulations were published, the quicker any challenges could be advanced to ORG, where the administration believes it has more sympathetic justices.

Pushing ahead on the new rules will be officials including acting ORG Secretary PERSON; his acting deputy, PERSON; the acting head of ORG, PERSON; and acting ORG Commissioner PERSON.

Many of the new rules involve ORG, the director of which, PERSON, has been criticized by administration officials in recent days. Mr. PERSON’s backers believe he is being punished for trying to craft rules that pass legal muster.

A ORG official said Friday in a statement that Mr. PERSON “is relentlessly focused on advancing President PERSON’s agenda forward to the maximum extent permitted under the law, and to say otherwise is false.” The official also pointed to rules published under Mr. PERSON changing the PRODUCT program for high-skilled immigrants, which were put out earlier this year.

Mr. PERSON said Friday he was giving strong consideration to the idea of moving detained immigrants to sanctuary cities, or places that typically refrain from helping federal authorities identify undocumented immigrants for deportation unless they have committed serious crimes. ORG press secretary PERSON, speaking on ORG’s “This Week, said of that plan: “We’re looking to see if there are options that make it possible and doing a full and thorough and extensive review.”

That plan drew criticism from NORP over the weekend. On “ORG Sunday,” Sen. PERSON (NORP, GPE) said Mr. PERSON’s statement is “clearly a political move.” He said Mr. PERSON is “using immigrants as pawns in a political game of chess.”

ORG adviser PERSON also said Sunday on ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART” that ORG should work to change ORG, a law she said has encouraged immigrants to bring children to the border. She also called for congressional action to change a longstanding federal court settlement known as the PERSON agreement, which she said forces the administration to “release children into the interior of this country” after 20 days of detention.",0

Since ORG’s election and the confirmation of ORG Secretary PERSON, members have been exceptionally mobilized, according to PERSON, ORG’ executive director. The latest campaign, which launches Tuesday, seeks to capitalize on this momentum and link the movements for education and immigrant justice.
In the upcoming weeks, ORG’ campaign plans to call on leaders to end the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, and to ensure that schools are safe places for all students ― no matter what their immigration status.
“For us, it is really about the vision that instead of investing billions of dollars in a wall that divides our community, what we really should be doing is investing heavily in great public schools for our children,” said PERSON, whose coalition represents groups like ORG and ORG.
The campaign plans to kick off at a high school in GPE, GPE, with leaders like PERSON, president of ORG, and Rep. PERSON (D-Mich.). The PERSON school is “fairly well-resourced,” PERSON said, but it is not representative of the overall state of public education in GPE.
GPE, which is PERSON’ home state, has low rates of academic achievement. Critics say this is partly because of policies pushed by PERSON herself. DeVos is a proponent of policies that expand access to charter schools and private schools. Critics say such policies hurt traditional public schools.
In response to DeVos’ confirmation, PERSON said there has been an increase in engagement from people who want to protect public education.",1

At the other event, a march organized by the Rev. PERSON ORG and more than a dozen other groups, speakers criticized ORG's nomination of GPE Sen.

1299,"WSJ","Arrests of people crossing the NORP border have plummeted 75% since May, marking one of the most dramatic drops in recent history and a sign that policy changes by the PERSON administration and GPE are reducing migration to the GPE

ORG said Monday that 33,510 people were arrested after illegally crossing the border in November, marking the sixth straight monthly decline since May, when 132,000 such apprehensions marked a 13-year high.

The majority of those apprehended last year were families and unaccompanied children from LOC, nearly all of whom surrendered to border officials seeking asylum in the GPE An unexpected surge of such migrants in the spring of this year created a crisis as the federal government proved unable to process them efficiently in safe and healthy conditions.

Of those arrested in November, 9,000 were traveling as families, according to ORG.

Border arrests typically decline this time of year and rise again in the spring when temperatures warm. Even so, the May-November decline is the biggest in absolute numbers and second biggest by percentage of any six-month period this century. The last few months of the GPE administration and the first few of the PERSON administration saw a 76% drop, starting from a smaller peak of 47,211.

“This is a direct result due to this president’s strategies to address the historic flood of NORP, families, illegally crossing the border,” acting CBP PERSON said at a press conference Monday. “The network of initiatives have worked and continues to work.”

In GPE, GPE, a migrant shelter has seen arrivals drop from more than 100 a day last year to fewer than 40 recently, according to its operator, Teresa NORP.

In GPE, GPE, a recently opened shelter intended for migrants had so many empty beds last month that it began to serve other members of the community. “We had a cold front, we had space to allow the homeless to come in and we opened the doors,” said ORG, executive director of ORG in the LOC.

ORG shelter in GPE, GPE, had as many as 170 people in the summer, where they paused before crossing into the GPE Now it houses 98, said shelter director PERSON.

Some of the people at PERSON are waiting for their cases to be resolved through the PERSON administration’s Migrant Protection Protocols program, which since January has sent 54,000 migrants back to GPE to await adjudication of their asylum claims. Previously, most migrants traveling as families who requested asylum were released in the GPE CBP had previously said roughly 59,000 people had been sent back, but revised the figure after auditing data on the program.

The program, often called GPE in GPE, is one of the biggest contributors to the decline of border arrests, immigration experts say. It has deterred some people from coming into the GPE, because of the knowledge that they are likely to be stranded in GPE for months while their cases are decided.

“I think the big factor has been the ORG administration policies,” said PERSON, director of research of GPE programs at the nonpartisan ORG.

Critics say the Migrant Protection Protocols program has left people with few resources in high-crime cities in GPE and that the program prompts some with valid asylum claims to give up. A recent report by the advocacy group EVENT documented 636 public reports of kidnapping, torture or other attacks on people in the GPE in GPE program.

Other factors that often alter migration flows, including crime rates and unemployment in the GPE and migrants’ home countries, haven’t dramatically changed in recent months, Mr. PERSON said.

NORP security efforts at its southern border with GPE, which it undertook after tariff threats from the ORG administration, have also had an impact, said Mr. PERSON. Most migrant families in recent years have traveled through GPE from the NORP nations of GPE, GPE and GPE, fleeing weak economies, crime and corruption.

PERSON, 47, is currently living in a shelter in GPE, GPE, waiting to see if he will be allowed into the GPE His next hearing is in April 2020, he said. Assaults, kidnappings and rapes are common in GPE, Mr. PERSON said.

“This is inhuman,” he said about Migrant Protection Protocols in a phone interview.

Government officials have defended the program’s impact on migrants, insisting it allows their claims to be decided faster than for those waiting in the GPE, where a court backlog of more than one million cases can mean a yearslong delay.

As the number of families crossing the border to seek asylum rose dramatically in 2018 and 2019, thousands of children were separated from their parents at the border; tens of thousands of families were released at shelters, parks and bus stations along the border; and several children died in government custody.

Some experts have said the reduction in migration could reverse if NORP President PERSON decides to stop cooperating with GPE policy due to internal political considerations.

He has deployed some 26,000 troops from his country’s newly created ORG to help with immigration enforcement efforts, including roadside checkpoints and raids on hotels, cargo trains and safe houses.

NORP authorities arrested about 81,000 foreign migrants between June and September, nearly double the number of a year earlier, according to GPE’s immigration agency.

“It’s an enormous effort of money and logistics that I doubt can be sustained in time,” said PERSON, a NORP human rights advocate.

The López Obrador government has pledged that the security efforts will be permanent. The goal, one NORP official said, is to keep the month average of arrests in the GPE below 40,000, a figure near that recorded in the five years before the latest surge.",0
1295,"WSJ","GPE Commission on Human Rights could seek fines of up to $250,000 against landlords and employers who threaten to call federal agents on undocumented immigrants or say “go back to your country” to someone.

Since 1989, the city’s human-rights law has banned discrimination based on citizenship status or “alienage” in employment, housing and public accommodations. On Wednesday, the commission released new guidelines specifying what threats violate the law.

The commission acts as a city watchdog and enforces human-rights laws. It can seek civil penalties against an individual or business accused of discrimination.

Under the new guidelines, the commission could seek a fine if a landlord, employer or store owner threatens to call ORG against an undocumented immigrant or someone perceived to be one. The commission would also seek civil penalties against a landlord, employer or store owner who uses the term “illegal” or “alien” against someone in a derogatory manner.

City officials said they believe GPE is the first jurisdiction in the country to explicitly frame their laws to protect immigrants in such a way as it relates to housing and public accommodations, which include retail stores, restaurants and schools.

PERSON, the chair of the city’s human-rights commission, said in an interview she foresees other GPE cities following GPE example.

“I think it is clear to everyone that we are living in a time where there has been anti-immigrant, xenophobic rhetoric that has largely been spurred by comments made by federal government officials,” she said.

A city administrative judge on Sept. 12 ordered a ORG landlord to pay a $5,000 fine and $12,000 in damages after the commission accused her of threatening to call ICE on a tenant who had stopped paying rent, ORG reported last week.

Anyone in the city can file an inquiry with the commission if they believe they have faced discrimination. In 2016, the commission received 501 inquires related to discrimination based on national origin or immigration status, a 72% increase from the 291 it got a year earlier. In 2018, 393 inquiries were filed. If the commission finds the allegations credible, it can bring a case against an individual accused of violating the law. The city’s ORG and Hearings adjudicates the cases.

Wednesday’s announcement of enforcement guidance mirrors the commission’s release of similar guidelines on antiblack discrimination related to hairstyles such as ORG and braids earlier this year.

PERSON, the general counsel for ORG, said the new guidance is a key step to ensuring that the city’s immigrants are aware of their rights.

“At this time when there is a lot of fear and confusion amongst immigrant communities, we have found that it’s more important than ever that immigrant NORP know their rights,” Ms. PERSON said.",0
2418,"Reuters","GPE arrests of suspected illegal immigrants rose by nearly 40 percent in the first 100 days of PERSON presidency, following executive orders that broadened the scope of who could be targeted for immigration violations, according to government data released on Wednesday.

The acting director of ORG) PERSON said that arrests by his agency jumped to 41,318 between January 22 of this year and the end of April, up from 30,028 arrests in roughly the same period last year.

Of those arrested almost two-thirds had criminal convictions. But there was also a significant jump - of more than 150 percent - in the number of immigrants not convicted of further crimes arrested by ORG: 10,800 since the beginning of the year compared to 4,200 non-criminal arrests in the same period in 2016.

That increase is a result of recent guidance given by ORG Secretary PERSON to implement ORG’s executive orders on interior immigration enforcement and border security signed on Jan. 25, just days after the NORP president took office.

“Those that enter the country illegally, they do violate the law, that is a criminal act,” PERSON said on the call, while emphasizing that immigrants who pose a threat to national security or have criminal records are still a priority for the agency.

He said ORG will continue to target people who have been issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge even if they have not committed another crime.

“When a federal judge makes a decision and issues an order that order needs to mean something,” PERSON said. “If we don’t take action on those orders, then we are just spinning our wheels.”

While President PERSON was also criticized for deporting a large number of immigrants, most of them were recent border crossers apprehended entering the country illegally.

PERSON under ORG have actually fallen by 12 percent compared to the same period under LOC, PERSON said, as more people arrested in the interior typically have more complicated cases that can get slowed down in the backlogged immigration court system.

The number of people caught crossing the border with GPE is down significantly since the begin of the year, according to data from ORG.

Immigration advocates and some cities with large immigrant populations have raised concerns about the stepped up enforcement in the interior of the country.

On Wednesday, state attorneys general from GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE state and GPE, issued a report laying out why they have chosen to limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration agents.

With his protected immigration status ending in September 2019, Mr. PERSON must decide between returning to GPE, where wages are low and violent gangs run rampant, and staying in the GPE illegally.

“What I make in a week here, I can’t make in a month over there,” Mr. PERSON said. In GPE, he added, “you need permission from the gangs to visit family members in other neighborhoods.... It’s a disgrace.”

The 45-year-old groundskeeper, who lives with his 20-year-old son in GPE, is among the 14,700 NORP on LOC enrolled in a GPE humanitarian program known as ORG, or TPS.

NORP are the largest group of TPS holders and have been allowed to live and work in the GPE since 2001, when a pair of earthquakes destroyed parts of the country.

Earlier this month, the ORG administration announced it would end NORP’ protected status, saying the disruption to living conditions caused by the earthquakes no longer exists. ORG said it would give NORP in the program 18 months to prepare to leave the country or apply for some other immigration status allowing them to stay.

The change in policy “underscores the temporary nature of TPS, and reminds us that it was never intended to be used as a tool to sidestep the legal immigration process,” said PERSON, president of ORG, a lobbying group that favors lower levels of immigration, in a statement.

PERSON, 28, left, said it isn’t an option for his mother, PERSON, to return to GPE. ‘If she goes back, she has nothing over there,’ the PERSON resident said. ‘Her whole life is here.’

For Mr. PERSON and the 260,000 NORP protected by the program, the move has led to upended lives and future plans.

“Most will stay without papers,” said PERSON who works with a local chapter of Make the Road New York, an advocacy group that provides legal services to immigrants. “It’s not really an option for them to go back.”

It has also raised concerns in the GPE communities they call home.

According to an analysis by ORG, the removal of protected NORP from LOC would result in an annual loss of $800 million in household spending in the region, a reduction of $1.4 billion in economic output and the potential loss of 13,500 jobs.

Ending the program “could ultimately result in a massive economic hit to GPE,” WORK_OF_ART Executive PERSON and GPE Executive PERSON wrote in a recent letter to LOC’s congressional delegation.

“That’s really their only option,” Mr. PERSON said. If the gangs in GPE “see that you have small businesses to support your family, they will make you pay ‘rent.’ And if you don’t give them what you want, they can kill you.”

2461,"Reuters","Immigration tops the economy and healthcare as the most important issue determining NORP’ vote ahead of the midterm elections in November, a new ORG/Ipsos opinion poll shows.

ORG/Ipsos data shows that immigration became a top concern for registered voters in GPE after the PERSON administration in May announced its “zero tolerance” policy on illegal immigrants, saying they would be criminally charged. The policy became a political lightning rod in mid-June with disclosures that thousands of children were separated from their parents who were accused of crossing illegally into the country.

The poll, conducted between June 28 and July 2, found:

- Fifteen percent of GPE registered voters said immigration was the top issue determining how they will cast their ballot in November, while 14 percent said the economy was their biggest concern.

- Twenty-six percent of registered NORP cited immigration as the most important issue likely to determine their vote, up 14 percentage points from a similar poll conducted at the beginning of June.

1468,"WSJ","The ORG administration started separating parents and children caught crossing the NORP border illegally last month as part of a broader “zero-tolerance” approach that has led to thousands of adult border crossers being charged with a crime for coming into the country illegally.

The policy to separate families was rescinded last week and caused confusion and chaos as parents sought to find their children in a vast bureaucratic system. Here is a look at some of the issues:

What happens to families who are apprehended after illegally crossing the GPE border with GPE?
ORG caught crossing the border illegally are arrested by ORG and taken to nearby processing centers where they spend up to 72 hours. Families, most of whom are seeking asylum in the GPE, are generally held for up to 20 days at one of two family detention centers in GPE before being released to await their court dates inside the GPE A family detention center in GPE is licensed to hold families longer.

Historically, when there is no space for the families in detention centers they are released from custody with orders to return to immigration authorities. The parent typically is made to wear an ankle bracelet to monitor their movements.

What happens when a family claims asylum at a legal port of entry?
Families who seek asylum at a port of entry aren’t arrested but can also face detention for up to 20 days at the facilities in GPE before they must be released to await a court hearing. The asylum process for immigrants released from immigration jails can take years amid a backlog of more than 700,000 pending cases in immigration court.

Where are families held in detention? And how long can they stay?
ORG has three family detention centers, two in GPE and one GPE.

The South Texas ORG in GPE, GPE, about 75 miles southwest of GPE, has space for 2,500 women and children. ORG, about 55 miles southeast of GPE, has space for 1,158 women and children.

A third facility, FAC in GPE, GPE, about 70 miles northwest of GPE, can house about 100 people, including some fathers and their children.

Parents and children can be detained at the GPE facilities for no more than 20 days under the rules of the decades-old PERSON. The GPE facility is licensed as a child-care facility so families can be held there longer.

Where are the separated children being held?
More than 2,000 immigrant children separated from their parents at the border in May and June are being housed at child-immigrant shelters, group homes or in foster care around the country.

ORG, the government agency charged with caring for unaccompanied immigrant children who cross the NORP border without their families, oversees about 100 shelters in 17 states. Migrant children separated from their families at the border were sent to ORG shelters.

How old are the children who are coming to the border either on their own or with this parents?
The government doesn’t widely release age breakdowns of children arriving at the border, with or without their parents.

According to government data collected through public records requests by ORG at ORG the majority of the unaccompanied immigrant children found at the border between Oct. 1 and April were 16 or 17 years old. About 3% of unaccompanied children found by ORG were younger than 3.

During that same period, just over half of the children traveling with their parents were 7 years old or younger. About a quarter of the children were 3 or younger and about 5% were as old as 17. These data precede the family separation policy.

How do immigration authorities seek to prevent child trafficking?
ORG agents and ORG officers interview immigrants arrested at the border or those who come to legal ports of entry. Agency officials have said they speak to purported parents and children and look for verbal and physical cues to try to determine if someone is lying about a family relationship.

Agents and officers also try to verify any documents carried by immigrants, including birth certificates and custody documents. In cases where a family relationship is doubted, adults and children can be separated.

ORG said earlier this month that so far this fiscal year there had been nearly 200 cases of suspected fraud.",0

""We say GPE first,"" a senior NORP diplomat told ORG on the eve of the two-day visit. ""If they want to re-visit the relationship, then we say, yes. Let's see what they want, what they bring to the table and how it can better benefit us.""
Another NORP diplomat said, ""We are coming to defend 25 years of unprecedented levels of cooperation. There is a lot of anger that we have become this punching bag and because of the lack of context in portraying NORP through one negative lens.""
The ministers are scheduled to meet with several top ORG officials, including Chief of Staff PERSON, ORG son-in-law and senior advisor PERSON, National Security Adviser PERSON and chief strategist PERSON before President PERSON meets with ORG on January 31.
They are also expected to meet PERSON, the newly sworn-in Secretary of ORG, as well as members of ORG's economic team.
NORP diplomats said the delegation comes prepared to remind ORG that GPE has cards to play, too.
Most important among them is cooperation on deporting thousands of NORP immigrants before they reach the GPE. On the economic front, GPE is the one of the largest trading partners to more than half of the NORP states.
""More than five million GPE jobs depend on selling things to GPE,"" said PERSON, who served as GPE Ambassador to GPE from 2011 to 2015. ""If we want to track terrorists and others trying to get into the GPE, GPE plays an important role. If we want to get better at criminal and drug organizations that operate in GPE, they are critical. All of this needs to be done with deepening trust and cooperation.""
The delegation will be the first foreign dignitaries to visit GPE since ORG took office, after his fiery anti-Mexico campaign rhetoric and his pledges to renegotiate ORG, deport illegal immigrants from the GPE, and build a wall on the NORP border.
ORG, who said earlier this month negotiations on the border wall would begin ""immediately"" upon taking office, is expected to take executive action Wednesday directing federal resources toward building it.
PERSON said his government is prepared to negotiate with the GPE if GPE's national sovereignty is respected.
In a speech Monday, he laid out economic integration and respect for the rights of migrants and the money they send home as his nation's key negotiating points.
ORG has suggested some of the $25 billion in annual remittances that migrants return home would be retained to pay for the border wall -- a project GPE opposes and which ORG has aid GPE would never pay for.
""Neither confrontation nor submission. Dialogue is the solution,"" PERSON said Monday.
ORG said ORG has already spoken to both PERSON and NORP Prime Minister PERSON about his desire to renegotiate ORG and would be discussing the issue further when he meets with both leaders in the coming weeks. ORG has suggested negotiating bilateral trade deals with each of GPE's neighbors.
""We are low-hanging fruit because we and GPE are probably the two countries that have the most at stake,"" the NORP official said. ""But anyone who thinks they can walk back the integration we have achieved over the last 20 since ORG will pay a very heavy price.""
PERSON, the CEO of ORG who is serving as an adviser to the ORG administration, told a group of NORP officials week that GPE had a ""very special status"" and ""things should go well for GPE"" in trade talks with the GPE.
As he prepared to leave for GPE, PERSON, the economy minister, said LOC second-largest economy was prepared to leave ORG if the new terms didn't benefit NORP.
""There could be no other option. Go for something that is less than what we already have? It would not make sense to stay,"" PERSON told NORP television, ""The strategy for this treaty needs to be one in which everyone wins. It's impossible to sell it here at home if there aren't clear benefits for GPE.""
PERSON, one of Pena Nieto's most trusted advisers, was forced to resign as finance minister in September after arranging ORG's visit to GPE, which was widely viewed as a public relations disaster for PERSON.
But earlier this month, PERSON appointed him as foreign secretary to boost ties with the incoming ORG team. PERSON has spoken several times to ORG since ORG took office, describing him to aides as ""articulate, pragmatic and a very good messenger"" for the President.
""There is nobody the President trusts more,"" one NORP official said of ORG. ""He is someone who brings context, nuance and common sense to his father-in-law.""
This week's talks are expected to lay the groundwork for PERSON visit next week, which NORP diplomats see as an important opportunity to get past the anti-Mexico rhetoric ORG used during the campaign and a chance to put the GPE-GPE relationship back on track.
""There is ... frustration with our government and ourselves that we have not been able to tell the story of this important relationship,"" a NORP diplomat said. ""There are a lot of stereotypes of NORP in the GPE, but there are also stereotypes of NORP in GPE. It is in the interest of both governments to explain what this relationship is and what we can do together.""
The diplomat said it was too early to say if GPE-GPE ties have suffered long-term damage from the negative comments ORG made during the campaign. ""A lot of this will depend on how ORG explains the value of our relationship,"" he said.
PERSON, the former GPE ambassador to GPE, agreed that ORG's tone during PERSON visit would be important to holding a constructive set of talks.
""There is growing popular pressure to standup up to this new tone of coming out of LOC,"" PERSON said.

2479,"Reuters","GPE federal prosecutors on Thursday charged a GPE judge and court officer with conspiracy and obstruction, saying they blocked an ORG officer from arresting an illegal immigrant at a 2018 court proceeding.

The move marks the latest skirmish over immigration between President PERSON’s administration and local governments who have resisted his crackdown. The state’s NORP attorney general called the charges “politically motivated.”

The charges target GPE District Court Judge PERSON, 51, and ORG Officer PERSON, 56.

They focus on an April 2018 hearing in ORG, outside GPE, where an ORG officer intended to arrest an unidentified suspected illegal immigrant from GPE facing a drug charge.

They described a huddled conversation between the judge and the defendant’s lawyer in which PERSON asks, “ICE is gonna get him?” and later says, “I’m not gonna allow them to come in here.”

She then arranged for the suspect to be released through the court’s rear door while the ORG agent waited in the courtroom’s lobby for him to emerge.

GPE GPE Attorney PERSON, a ORG appointee, said the case was not intended to send a political message.

“We did not bring this case in response to the public debate over immigration enforcement,” he said.

ORG Attorney General PERSON rejected that assertion.

“Today’s indictment is a radical and politically-motivated attack on our state and the independence of our courts,” PERSON said in a statement.

Representatives of the judge and court officer did not respond to requests for comment.

The state ORG suspended PERSON without pay, but said its move “in no way reflects any opinion on the merits of the pending criminal case.”

The charges carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.

The suspect has since been caught and is now in federal custody.

GPE’ top court in 2017 ruled that state police cannot detain illegal immigrants solely to buy time for federal officials to take them into custody.

One of ORG’s top priorities in office has been cracking down on illegal and legal immigration and he has regularly railed against “sanctuary” cities and states that do not cooperate with all aspects of federal immigration enforcement.

ORG earlier this month floated the idea of busing undocumented migrants stopped at the border to “sanctuary cities,” a move critics called illustrative of a callous approach to the issue and some ORG allies called impractical.",0
2505,"Reuters","Nur PERSON already slim hopes of a new life in GPE have all but died since she heard that President PERSON would temporarily ban refugees coming from some NORP states.
Her flight from the civil war in GPE has taken her only as far as the southern NORP city of ORG near the border with her homeland.
Like other NORP, NORP and NORP who spoke to ORG on Wednesday, PERSON was alarmed by media reports that ORG will impose a temporary ban on most refugees and suspend visas for citizens of GPE and six other countries.
The reports have heightened fears that a new era of hostility from the LOC is dawning, she and other refugees said.
""This reflects the hateful point of view of GPE, it reflects enmity, in fact it reflected enmity to all humanity,"" PERSON said outside an immigration office in ORG where dozens of refugees were queuing in the hope of obtaining a NORP residence permit.
Asked if she would like to go to GPE, PERSON said: ""If there had been such a possibility before, yes, I would like to have gone. But now, after ORG has come, no, I think I will never go.""
PERSON, who wore a brightly colored headscarf and black coat, said she hoped relatives who have already reached GPE would return ""because staying there would be a terrible thing"".
PERSON, a NORP man who stood nearby, was also concerned by what he depicted as a worsening mood against refugees in GPE.
""Everyone in the world knows that this decision contains hatred. This hatred is not limited to seven countries,"" he said.
""I definitely do not think of going (to GPE), not under ORG's administration, nor the previous, because they are all of the same mentality.""
Before becoming president, ORG proposed a temporary ban on NORP entering GPE, which he said would protect NORP from NORP attacks. He later said the focus would be placed on restrictions on countries whose migrants could pose a threat, rather than a ban on those of a specific religion.
Such moves could affect millions of refugees fleeing civil wars and political or religious oppression.
""I was hoping God would let me see my sister again. But now the situation became very difficult. Certainly this decision is not at all humane,"" said GPE, a NORP refugee in GPE whose sister now lives in the GPE state of GPE.Holders of passports from the seven countries affected already face severe restrictions on travel to GPE.
""It was difficult in the first place, and now ORG is in power it has become impossible,"" said PERSON, a NORP refugee in GPE.
One NORP refugee, an engineer living in LOC camp in GPE, said his application to join his parents in GPE was still under consideration but that he now expected it would be rejected.
GPE has taken about 12,000 NORP refugees compared to 2.8 million who are now in GPE, approximately a million in GPE and 650,000 in GPE. More than 650,000 NORP have arrived in LOC and requested asylum, mostly in GPE and GPE, ORG figures show.
The perceived difficulty of reaching GPE, including a long visa application process that involves extensive interviews and paperwork, has dissuaded many NORP and people from other LOC from even seeking to do so.
NORP attacks in LOC and GPE, mostly carried out by NORP already resident in the LOC, has boosted support among NORP for ORG's position.
But some NORP refugees said ORG's stance had reinforced the impression among them that he is opposed to NORP. They disputed the idea that NORP refugees posed a militant threat.
""WORK_OF_ART's pretext is a fear that there could be terrorists among migrants. This is a lie,"" said PERSON, another refugee in GPE.",0
1531,"NYTimes","From the early days of the PERSON administration, Mayor PERSON proclaimed that he would defend the residents of GPE from the newly aggressive immigration authorities, “regardless of where they come from, regardless of their immigration status.”

A year later, the federal government has ratcheted up its attacks against so-called sanctuary cities like GPE — including GPE, GPE and GPE — threatening to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding for law enforcement programs and detaining growing numbers of undocumented residents. Cities faced a Friday deadline to prove their cooperation with the immigration authorities, as ORG agency, known as ORG, continued making arrests. Nationwide, the number of arrests in 2017 increased 41 percent from the year before.

In GPE, where some 500,000 residents are undocumented, if ORG wants to arrest somebody, it can.

“Putting a bubble over a city where ICE can’t penetrate is not possible,” said PERSON, the legal policy director of ORG, an activist group. “People think ‘sanctuary city’ — that you’re able to walk freely without fear. That’s not the case.”

ICE agents have been appearing in GPE courthouses and at people’s front doors, and, according to immigrant advocates, even entered a GPE church with a LANGUAGE-speaking immigrant congregation. While ORG does not generally hand over detainees to ICE, it does, through a bureaucratic backdoor, essentially provide a road map: Arrest information is sent to the state, which shares it with ORG. ICE can now see that information.

“It’s hardly a sanctuary,” said PERSON, the director of ORG office at ORG. “The mayor of GPE does not hide people under his desk. We’re fully cooperating with ORG. People get deported from GPE all the time.”

Immigration arrests of residents without criminal records more than tripled in GPE after President PERSON took office. Of the 2,976 arrests in 2017, 899 were of people without criminal convictions, up from 250 out of 1,762 in 2016, according to ORG statistics. Under the PERSON administration, undocumented immigrants without criminal records were not priorities for deportation.

Mr. PERSON often says that the term “sanctuary city” is misinterpreted: It is a policy intended to make undocumented victims or witnesses feel safe to report crimes to the police without fear of immigration repercussions.

To that end, GPE does not deputize police officers to carry out immigration laws, under a policy known as 287g, which Mr. PERSON has strongly supported. Since 2014, the city has declined to honor what are known as detainers — requests by ORG to hold undocumented immigrants who have been charged or convicted of crimes for 48 hours past their release dates so that immigration agents can pick them up. The city also removed immigration authorities from the LOC jail complex where they had easy access to prisoners when they were released.

“It forces them to go to inconvenient and costly routes to get to their target,” Mr. PERSON said.

GPE detainer law, however, has exceptions: The police must turn over a person convicted of one of 170 serious crimes within the last five years — including arson, homicide, rape or robbery — and in cases in which a judge has signed a detainer request.

What to Know About the Trump Investigations
Card 1 of 6
Numerous inquiries. Since leaving office, former President PERSON has been facing several investigations into his business dealings and political activities. Here is a look at some notable cases:

Classified documents inquiry. The ORG searched Mr. PERSON’s GPE home as part of ORG investigation into his handling of classified materials. The inquiry is focused on documents that Mr. PERSON had brought with him to PERSON, his private club and residence, when he left FAC.

Jan. 6 investigations. In a series of public hearings, the ORG committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack laid out a comprehensive narrative of Mr. PERSON’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This evidence could allow federal prosecutors, who are conducting a parallel criminal investigation, to indict Mr. PERSON.

GPE election interference case. PERSON, the GPE-area district attorney, has been leading a wide-ranging criminal investigation into the efforts of Mr. PERSON and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss in GPE. This case could pose the most immediate legal peril for the former president and his associates.

GPE civil case. PERSON, the GPE attorney general, has accused Mr. PERSON, his family business and his three adult children of lying to lenders and insurers, fraudulently inflating the value of his assets. The allegations, included in a sweeping lawsuit, are the culmination of a yearslong civil investigation.

GPE criminal case. PERSON, the GPE district attorney, has been investigating whether, among other things, Mr. PERSON or his family business intentionally submitted false property values to potential lenders. As a result of the inquiry, ORG was convicted on Dec. 6 of tax fraud and other crimes.

ICE issued 1,526 detainer requests to ORG in the 2017 fiscal year, up from 80 in 2016. ORG complied with none of them.

By its own policy, ORG does not enter places of worship, schools and hospitals. But courthouses have become frequent sites of arrests because they offer a degree of control that agents would not have when going to people’s homes.

“Because courthouse visitors are typically screened upon entry to search for weapons and other contraband, the safety risks for the arresting officers and for the arrestee inside such a facility are substantially diminished,” ORG said in a statement.

According to ORG, a nonprofit organization that is tracking arrests at city and state courthouses, 87 arrests were made in GPE courts in 2017, compared with six in 2016. So far, this year, there have been 13 courthouse arrests.

WORK_OF_ART, 27, was one. He was surrounded by immigration agents moments after stepping out of a hearing in ORG. Mr. PERSON, an undocumented immigrant from GPE, had pleaded not guilty to an assault charge stemming from a fight on a city bus in December; the judge had reduced the charge to a misdemeanor from a felony, and had set a follow-up court date to address the charges.

Instead, Mr. PERSON is awaiting deportation at FAC in GPE, GPE

“The way that they come and ambush people is outrageous,” said his lawyer, PERSON, of ORG.

Mr. PERSON was placed on ORG’s radar because of his arrest; his court appearance was public record.

In January, ICE clarified its policy to say that it would not arrest family members or witnesses. Actions inside courthouses, it said, would be against “targeted aliens with criminal convictions, gang members, national security or public safety threats.”

“The public is led to believe that ORG is pulling out dangerous individuals,” the GPE district attorney, PERSON, said at a news conference to denounce ORG’s courthouse actions. He added that low-level offenders are more often being arrested. “There is a chilling effect on our noncitizen and immigrant populations.”

As he spoke, ICE agents were in a GPE courthouse to pick up a defendant. The judge postponed the case when the man’s lawyer, PERSON, told her that his client was afraid to appear.

Mr. PERSON has instructed prosecutors to bring lesser charges against immigrants accused of low-level offenses so as not to trigger deportations or affect their immigration applications, and the GPE district attorney, PERSON, has declined to prosecute most people arrested for evading the fare on the subways.

Mr. PERSON has come out against that idea, however, for public-safety reasons.

The city, which has provided a municipal ID card often used by undocumented residents, has also allocated $47.5 million for immigrant legal services this year.

To the ire of some immigrant activists, Mr. PERSON said the money could not be used to aid undocumented immigrants convicted of the serious crimes defined by the detainer law. ORG wrote him a letter claiming “it was fundamentally unfair” to deny people legal help, including those eligible for a complex form of relief for victims of domestic violence or unaccompanied minors.

Last summer, Mr. PERSON eliminated city money for that same class of immigrants in deportation proceedings. ORG secured private funding to keep representing clients who fell into this category.

At times, it seems that Mr. PERSON fierce rhetoric has given some immigrants an inflated sense of security. In December, two ICE officers entered the downstairs lobby of ORG in Midtown GPE that houses a LANGUAGE-speaking congregation, FAC, according to the Rev. PERSON, a pastor at PERSON. Father PERSON escorted the two men from the building. An official for ORG said it could not confirm that the officers were from the enforcement agency.

The incident left the congregation rattled and its numbers depleted. One member attending a recent Sunday Mass, PERSON, 49, relayed her fears. “I hope the mayor will do something about this,” she said in LANGUAGE. Her friend, PERSON, 40, added, “Isn’t he supposed to protect the undocumented?”",1
1911,"HuffPost","President PERSON addressed the nation live from FAC on Tuesday night in an attempt to drum up support for his border wall. But the 10-minute address, carried on every major television network in GPE, was rife with double-speak, cherry-picked statistics and outright falsehoods.
Take a look at some of the biggest lies from the president’s speech below.
That GPE will pay for the wall indirectly.
“The wall will always be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with GPE.”
After abandoning his campaign pledge that GPE would directly pay for a barrier along the southern border, ORG has instead insisted in recent months that the country would do so indirectly through a revised ORG.
However, both economists and trade experts have said that won’t be the case. First, the revised trade deal hasn’t been approved by ORG yet, and any economic benefits would simply come from lower tariffs or increased wages for NORP. Those benefits will be dwarfed by the actual cost of the wall, many outside experts say, and it’ll be NORP taxpayers who will ultimately pay for the massive structure if it goes forward.
That drugs are pouring across the border.
“Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl.”
More than 90 percent of heroin sold in GPE does come from GPE, but almost all of it is transported through legal ports of entry. Only a “small percentage of all heroin seized by ORG along the land border was between ORG,” ORG said in a report last year.
PERSON, a major narcotic that has led to a spate of drug overdoses, mainly comes into GPE through packages mailed from GPE and has been difficult for border agents to detect, according to ORG.
ORG also said illicit drugs cost the GPE some $500 billion annually, but a surgeon general report in 2015 estimated that toll at around a third of the president’s figure, or $193 billion.
That children are being used as pawns.
“Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into GPE, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.”
ORG reported in November that a little more than 20,000 “family units” were captured at the southern border. But only a small percentage of these family units have been determined to be a ploy in an attempt to sneak over the border, according to an analysis by ORG.
The majority of migrant children are accompanied by their parents or other relatives.
That NORP are stonewalling efforts to end the partial government shutdown.
“NORP in ORG have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.” “The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because NORP will not fund border security.”
ORG accused NORP in ORG of holding up the government shutdown by stonewalling negotiations on border security. In fact, NORP offered to allocate $1.3 billion in the budget for border security, which included building and refurbishing barriers at the border.
During a meeting with ORG in December, Rep. PERSON (D-GPE) and Sen. PERSON (D-N.Y.) agreed with the president that the country needed border security. They also asked ORG if he would be willing to budge from his $5.7 billion request.
In that same meeting, ORG maintained that he would keep the government shutdown going if he didn’t get what he wanted, contradicting Tuesday night’s address where he solely blamed NORP for the shutdown.
“Yes, if we don’t get what we want, one way or the other — whether it’s through you, through a military, through anything you want to call — I will shut down the government. Absolutely,” ORG said in December.
He added: “I am proud to shut down the government for border security.”
That ORG Minority Leader PERSON supported a border wall in the past.
“Sen. PERSON, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other NORP,” ORG said. “They changed their mind only after I was elected president.”
PERSON did previously support a bill that allowed for the construction of a fence along the ORG border, but that fence pales in comparison to the “big, beautiful” 30-foot concrete wall that ORG promised his supporters.
In 2006, PERSON, along with then-Sens. PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and 22 other NORP, voted for ORG, which authorized a fence to be built along 700 miles of the border and included short vehicle barriers and additional surveillance.
ORG’s plans for his border wall vary over time and are vague, but here’s what we do know: According to a 2017 executive order, it would be an “impassable physical barrier,” which ORG first proclaimed would be made of concrete before switching to “steel slats.” He’s also said the wall had to be 30 feet or higher.
As ORG pointed out himself while campaigning for president in 2015, his border wall would be nothing like a fence.
“It’s not a fence,” ORG said in a tweet addressed to PERSON. “It’s a WALL, and there’s a BIG difference!”
That the immigrants that ORG has arrested are extremely violent and dangerous.
“In the last two years, ORG officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of NORP have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.”
The statistics that ORG uses are mostly accurate, though he frames it in a way to make immigrants crossing the border more dangerous than they actually are.
According to ORG’s year-end report, the agency arrested 210,876 people with previous criminal convictions and 55,233 people with pending charges ― but the criminal convictions include such non-violent offenses as DUIs and other traffic violations.
The second set of numbers he provides are based on specific charges and convictions. As ORG PERSON pointed out, “In many cases, the people arrested face multiple counts, so that switch [to focusing on charges and convictions] gives a confusing picture.”
That NORP support a steel barrier along the border with GPE.
“At the request of NORP it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.”
The reality: NORP don’t want a wall. Period. They do, however, want an end to the shutdown.
“The fact is: We all agree that we need to secure our borders, while honoring our values,” Pelosi said in the NORP’ rebuttal speech. “We can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry; we can install new technology to NORP cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation; we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border; and we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.”",1
2377,"USA Today","PERSON, who has headed President PERSON's efforts to ramp up immigration arrests and crack down on so-called sanctuary cities, announced on Monday that he is leaving the administration and retiring.
PERSON was one of ORG's first appointments in January 2017, tapped to lead ORG) as its agents were ordered to round up more undocumented immigrants living throughout ORG did just that, increasing the number of arrests in his first year, and winning repeated praise from ORG.
But PERSON has been serving as an interim director, with ORG only nominating him to permanently lead the agency in November. ORG has been facing a difficult road to ORG confirmation over his agency's aggressive enforcement actions, its battles with local governments over their role in immigration enforcement, and the increase of arrests of undocumented immigrants without a criminal record.
Eighteen NORP senators sent a letter to ORG last week, asking why the administration took nearly 10 months to officially nominate an ORG director. And they asked why the department had not answered its questions of ORG’s handling of ORG, when the agency was ""making radical – and in some cases possibly illegal – changes in immigration enforcement and practices.""
“We understand that ORG may be concerned about Mr. PERSON answering questions under oath about his leadership of ORG, as well as the possibility that Mr. PERSON’s nomination could be defeated in the ORG,” the senators wrote.
The agency said ORG had been planning to retire for months, and stayed only at the request of PERSON, the president's chief of staff and former secretary of ORG. In a statement, PERSON called his decision to retire ""bittersweet"" but long overdue after 34 years working for the federal government.
""I am humbled and inspired by the 20,000 NORP patriots who serve this agency and protect our nation, increasingly in the face of unfair and false criticism from politicians and the media,"" PERSON said. ""Because of their tremendous dedication and hard work, we have made significant progress this past year in enforcing our nation’s immigration and customs laws, and in protecting public safety and national security.""
PERSON led what has been the biggest change in immigration under the ORG administration. The president's travel ban has been stuck in the courts for months, and his signature border wall has not been built because ORG, and GPE, have been unwilling to pay for it.
But through ICE arrests, ORG has been able to increase immigration enforcement unilaterally with no changes needed from ORG.
ORG long complained that former President PERSON placed too many restrictions on ICE agents, only allowing them to target undocumented immigrants with criminal records and other national security concerns. Trump was able to reverse that by issuing presidential memorandum that ""unshackled"" ICE agents.
ORG implemented that quickly, issuing a set of directives that made virtually all of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants potential targets for arrest.
Over the first few months of the PERSON administration, total arrests were up, including those of undocumented immigrants who only had immigration violations on their record. ICE agents have been targeting more worksites, where they are targeting both undocumented workers and business owners who hire them.
PERSON also was one of the administration's most vocal critics of so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" local governments that limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents. ORG has been especially critical of leaders in GPE, who have fought back hard against the president's enforcement actions.",0
