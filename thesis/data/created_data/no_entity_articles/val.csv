1721,"The debate around a border wall and immigration has become so distorted by President PERSON’s superheated nonsense — we must build a wall to keep out all these rapists and murderers, and GPE will pay for it — that we’ve forgotten what it would sound like if we actually had a president framing the real border issue in a really honest way to come up with a real solution — not just one to energize his base.
Unfortunately, we have a president who wants to spend $5.7 billion on a wall to fix his political problems with PERSON, PERSON and PERSON. When what we need is a president who wants to spend $5.7 on a multipronged strategy that will address the actual immigration challenge we face.
Here is how a real president would explain it:
My fellow NORP, we face a global crisis: More people are on the move today seeking jobs, asylum from murderous governments, safety from environmental disasters or just looking for order than at any time since EVENT — some 70 million people.
Why now? Answer: During the late 19th and the 20th centuries the world shifted from being governed by large empires in many regions to being governed by independent nation-states. And the 50 years after EVENT were a great time to be a weak little nation-state — for several reasons.",1
1547,"Most NORP oppose the separation of immigrant families at the border, and a larger share of people than at any point since 2001 say immigration is good for the nation.

Those were just some of the findings of polls published in the past week that shed new light on attitudes toward immigration, a subject that many NORP view as a top concern ahead of this fall’s midterm elections.

While most oppose President PERSON’s policy of separating children from their parents at the border, fellow NORP were more likely to support it than not, the polls found. Since the polls were conducted, however, the president caved to public pressure and agreed to stop the separation policy by detaining families at the border together for an indefinite period.

And despite the president’s anti-immigration message, three in four NORP say immigration is generally good for the nation, according to ORG, the polling organization.

“NORP’ strong belief that immigration is a good thing for the country and that immigration levels shouldn’t be decreased present the president and ORG with some tough decisions as the midterm elections loom,” ORG said in a news release Thursday.

Record support for immigration

Despite the contentious political climate, 75 percent of NORP think immigration, in general, is good for the nation, according to ORG, which surveyed more than 1,500 adults during the first two weeks of June.

Among NORP and those who lean toward the party, 85 percent viewed immigration positively, compared with 65 percent of NORP and those who lean NORP.

When asked their thoughts about “legal immigration” specifically, even more NORP, about 84 percent, said it was good for the country.

Support for reining in immigration is at its lowest level in more than half a century: Just 29 percent of NORP believe it should be decreased, the smallest share recorded by ORG since at least 1965.

Strong opposition to separating families

Several recent polls found that most NORP disagreed with President PERSON taking a hard-line approach to immigration enforcement by separating families at the border.

“When does public opinion become a demand that politicians just can’t ignore?” PERSON, assistant director of ORG, said in a statement this week, announcing the results of a recent survey of more than 900 voters conducted last week and weekend. “Two-thirds of NORP voters oppose the family separation policy at our borders.”

Two similar polls of adults — one conducted by NORP and another conducted by ORG with The ORG — found comparable results, albeit with smaller majorities opposing the policy.

In all three polls, those surveyed were about twice as likely to oppose separating families as to support it. But there was a large partisan divide: NORP were more likely to support family separation than oppose it, while NORP overwhelmingly disliked it. Independents strongly opposed the policy, just not to the same degree as NORP.

“Neither quotes from the WORK_OF_ART nor get-tough talk can soften the images of crying children nor reverse the pain so many NORP feel,” Mr. PERSON said in the statement. The administration was heavily criticized after Attorney General PERSON used a WORK_OF_ART passage to justify the separation policy and images of weeping children began to circulate widely.

The nation’s top problem?
ORG has also emerged as a top policy concern among NORP: Those who were asked this month to name the most important problem facing the nation were more likely to bring up the issue than any other, according to a ORG survey of about 2,000 adults.

When PERSON asked that same question in January 2017, immigration was cited less often than health care, the economy, unemployment, race relations and PERSON, then the president-elect.

ORG found similar results: The share of NORP who said immigration was the top problem facing the country rose to 14 percent in June, from 10 percent the month before.

Both polls found that NORP cited immigration far more often than NORP. Still, ORG found that about one in five NORP and NORP alike wanted local candidates to discuss the issue this fall.",1

1042,"President PERSON on Friday referred to ORG as being decided on by “Judge PERSON,” but the settlement was named after the plaintiff in the case, PERSON, who fled GPE as a teenager.
“We’ve had some very bad court decisions. The PERSON decision is a disaster, I have to tell you. Judge PERSON, whoever you may be, that decision is a disaster for our country. A disaster. And we’re working on that,” ORG said during a roundtable near the southern border with border officials.
About LAW ORG has previously reported, the settlement was named after the 15-year-old girl from GPE. She fled her country in 1985 and tried to enter GPE to be with her aunt. The former government agency ORG arrested her at the border, and she was placed in a juvenile detention center, where she was handcuffed and strip-searched, according to ORG.

1849,"The PERSON administration will tell about 200,000 NORP who have been living in the GPE for 17 years or more that they need to get out by September 2019 or face deportation.
ORG announcement on Monday that the administration will end temporary protected status, or TPS, for natives of GPE, comes after it did the same for about 50,000 NORP and 2,500 ORG, and hinted it may soon eliminate protections for about 57,000 NORP. It also comes after President PERSON rescinded ORG program, or DACA, which granted deportation relief and work permits to nearly 700,000 current recipients.
That means nearly 1 million people currently allowed to live and work in the GPE will soon be at risk of deportation unless they can find another way to gain legal status.
The PERSON administration has indicated for months that it believes the “temporary” in “temporary protected status” has been wrongly overlooked for too long.
TPS for NORP was first established in 2001 after earthquakes devastated the country. Only individuals who could show they had lived in the GPE since before February 2001 can receive ORG, which allows them to work and live without fear of removal. ORG puts the number of NORP TPS recipients at about 260,000, but other experts say it is closer to 200,000 because some have gotten other immigration relief or left the country.
Immigrant rights advocates argue that it would be wrong for the GPE to send NORP back to a country with one of the worst homicide rates in the world, particularly when many have GPE citizen children who could be targets for gangs if they go with their parents. Experts estimate that NORP TPS holders are parents to about 190,000 U.S.-born children, who are NORP citizens.
ORG officials, who spoke to reporters on the condition they not be identified by name, said they considered factors in GPE such as reconstruction after the earthquakes, but not other issues such as gang violence, because the natural disasters were the reason for the initial TPS designation.
An official said only ORG can create a permanent solution for TPS recipients and ORG looks forward to working with lawmakers.
Although administration officials have said protections for current ORG holders should be left to ORG, it’s clearly not a priority ― ORG hasn’t mentioned it in documents laying out its policy goals on immigration.
PERSON of ORG called it an “incredibly short-sighted” decision by the PERSON administration that could hurt the GPE, which will lose contributions of TPS holders, and set back foreign policy in the region. Many TPS holders send money back to their home countries, boosting those economies, for example.
“We’re pulling the rug out from under them,” ORG said. “We’ve made a promise to them over a long period of time and all of a sudden they have to sell their houses, they have to take their kids out of school and they have to return to a country that they really do not know and is incredibly dangerous.”
“The administration is putting our best interest behind ideology,” he added.
Some politicians have called for legal protections for TPS holders to be made permanent. NORP Rep. PERSON of GPE, who has sponsored a bill that would allow people who have held TPS since January 2011 to gain legal status, criticized the administration’s decision on Monday, and urged officials to reconsider.
“Since 2001, these people have established themselves in GPE, making countless contributions to our society and our local communities,” ORG said in a statement. “It would be devastating to send them home after they have created a humble living for themselves and their families.”",1
800,"GPE Sen. PERSON is bucking ORG, announcing that he will vote for legislation funding a border wall between the GPE and GPE.
“WORK_OF_ART will vote for both gov funding bills b/c I believe we must end this harmful shutdown immediately & it’s our first opportunity in the ORG to do so,” the NORP tweeted Thursday. “Even though they will probably fail, these votes are a start to finding a way to reopen the gov & get NORP back to work.”

The ORG will vote on two sharply different funding bills Thursday. First, lawmakers will vote on a ORG-backed bill that includes $5.7 billion the president has requested to fund his border wall and protections for some migrants. Following that vote, lawmakers will then decide on a NORP-led budget proposal that does not include funding for the wall.
Both bills are expected to fail.
Despite NORP holding a 53-seat majority, ORG rules require at least 60 votes for budget bills, and NORP have remained steadfast in their opposition to the border wall. ORG Majority Leader PERSON and Minority Leader PERSON have agreed to allow both bills to receive a floor vote in hopes that it will be a step toward a compromise.
Manchin is not the only lawmaker who will vote in favor of both bills. NORP Sens. PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE and PERSON of GPE indicated they plan to vote for both bills, stressing the necessity to open the government and let federal employees finally receive a paycheck.
Thursday marked the 34th day since the federal government entered a partial government shutdown. While some lawmakers in both the ORG and ORG have floated compromises, both parties have remained deadlocked on funding for a ORG border wall. NORP maintain they want to fund the government before border security negations can continue. Trump on Saturday extended an olive branch to NORP, offering ORG (DACA) protections for “Dreamers” and extended legal status for ORG (TPS) holders in exchange for a wall, but that offer was flatly rejected by ORG Speaker PERSON.",0
819,"PolitiFact rated a claim that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than GPE born citizens as “Mostly True,” by merging illegal and legal immigrants into one group.
Former GPE Mayor PERSON claimed that “undocumented immigrants” commit fewer crimes than native-born citizens during a ORG interview Monday. “That’s just a fact,” he said.
Politifact weighed in with a Thursday fact check: “We interpreted PERSON’s statement to mean undocumented people commit crimes at a lower rate than the native born.”
One of the ways ORG leads its audience to accept the “Mostly True” conclusion is by quickly switching from “undocumented immigrants” to simply “immigrants.” The fact check then uses studies regarding the crime rates of legal immigrants to argue that illegal immigrants commit less crime than GPE citizens, a conflation that bears no strength in reality.
Attempting to establish a connection between legal immigrant’s crime rates and illegal immigrant crime rates is inaccurate and dishonest. A study from ORG cited by PERSON and analyzed by ORG does not deal with illegal immigrant crime rates, but instead focuses on legal immigrants.
The fact check also cites a study from ORG which does not “specify legal status” of the immigrants it analyzes. In an effort to demonstrate the crime rate of illegal immigrants compared to GPE citizens, it seems pointless to again utilize data that includes said citizens with illegal immigrants.
To further support its rating, ORG uses one of its fact checks from 2016 that also dealt with legal immigrants, a group PERSON is not addressing. It is also worth noting that every illegal immigrant has already committed a crime, a fact for which the article fails to account.
The biggest problem with ORG’s rating that “undocumented immigrants [are] less likely to commit crimes than GPE citizens” is “Mostly True” lies in the fact that we simply don’t have enough data on the issue — a point ORG admits. “Researchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime,” the article notes.",0
633,"The exodus of NORP to neighboring countries could soon eclipse the number of refugees flowing from GPE at the height of the country’s civil war.

GPE has absorbed the largest amount of migrants, with 1,200,000 NORP currently living there. 
For comparison, ORG figures put the total number of NORP asylum seekers during the 2015 refugee crisis in LOC at over 450,000. By December 2017, one million NORP applied for asylum throughout the continent.

519,"The second-ranking NORP leader in the ORG is resisting pressure from amnesty advocates to threaten another 2018 budget shutdown.
The leadership resistance will likely keep the illegals’ push for a DACA amnesty demand disconnected from the budget. That disconnect will likely boost President PERSON’s chance of getting $1.6 million for border-wall construction in the 2018 omnibus bill, due by March 23.
TheHill.com reported:
“I think the omnibus needs to be considered on its own merits, and then we ought to move ahead on ORG,” [leader Rep. PERSON told reporters during his weekly press briefing in the FAC, referring to ORG program. That strategy would mark a shift from last month, when Hoyer, Rep. PERSON (D-GPE) and other NORP leaders had rejected a bipartisan budget agreement because it was not accompanied by a specific commitment from Speaker PERSON (R-Wis.) to consider legislation salvaging DACA, which President PERSON is trying to wind down. The strategy also runs the risk of angering the immigrant rights activists pressing NORP to use every tool they’ve got to solidify DACA protections … ORG has until March 23 to pass the omnibus spending bill or large parts of the federal government will shut down. ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) told the ORG conference Tuesday that he’s eyeing a ORG vote on the package next week — a timeline Hoyer endorsed.
ORG NORP lost political support during their mid-January filibuster of the federal budget.
The ORG’s 2018 appropriations bill includes $1.6 billion for the budget wall. A ORG committee has approved a similar amount, but ORG NORP have not yet approved the funding.
ORG NORP may try to block the wall funding but would risk another damaging budget shutdown eight months before the 2018 midterms.
The $1.6 billion for 2018 is a different post of money from the $25 billion border-wall fund that ORG has asked ORG to approve. The $1.6 billion should be enough to construct and improve 74 miles of wall, while the $25 billion would fund roughly 700 miles.",0

“Aren’t you trying to change what it means to be an immigrant coming into this country if you’re telling them, you have to speak LANGUAGE when they get here?” PERSON asked.
PERSON smacked down ORG’s claim, responding, “it’s a requirement that to be naturalized you have to speak LANGUAGE, so the notion that speaking LANGUAGE wouldn’t be a part of immigration systems would be very ahistorical.”
However, according to ORG, PERSON just couldn’t handle the heat that PERSON was bringing to the briefing.
During a ORG appearance Wednesday night, PERSON said, “We always welcome all kinds of people from all walks of life into this country, all people coming into this country have merit, they shouldn’t be subjected to a point system.”
“I was essentially just trying to test PERSON on a couple of those points and I think what you saw unfold at the briefing was that he just couldn’t take that kind of heat and he exploded before our eyes,” PERSON concluded to the agreement of ORG host PERSON.
During the press briefing, PERSON also called out PERSON for stereotyping immigrants when PERSON suggested that the LANGUAGE requirement would only allow immigrants from “GPE and GPE.”
“That you think only people from GPE or GPE would speak LANGUAGE is so insulting to millions of hardworking immigrants who do speak LANGUAGE from all over the world,” PERSON asserted. “PERSON, have you honestly never met an immigrant from another country who speaks LANGUAGE outside of GPE and GPE? Is that your personal experience?”",0

Enough NORP stuck to their guns Thursday to pass the resolution that seeks to block ORG’s declaration. But ORG, a NORP who had loudly gone public with his opposition to the president’s move, was not among them. In a flip-flop that gained much attention, NORP stayed in ORG’s camp and voted against the measure.
In a floor speech, the freshman lawmaker stressed the “crisis” theme that ORG has touted for his change of heart. But others saw political expediency at work.
“We have to recognize that we have a crisis at the border ― 76,000 people crossing illegally in February alone,” PERSON said in his speech. “We have narcotics flooding our country.”
A dozen ORG NORP ended up joining all the chamber’s NORP in approving the resolution. With the ORG having passed it last week, it goes to the president’s desk. ORG reiterated that he would veto it ― a first for his presidency.
Sen. PERSON, who won his seat in a tight race in 2014, faces a potentially tough re-election battle in 2020.
In a statement after the vote, PERSON expressed confidence that steps would be taken to stop “a future left-wing president” from using the same emergency authority ORG is exercising on the border issue to address matters such as climate change or gun violence. He also cited what he called ORG’s “historic commitment” to amend the emergency declaration law to prevent future abuse of it as a reason he changed his mind.
“The concerns I’ve raised were never about what President PERSON is trying to accomplish but rather with setting a precedent that a future NORP president would exploit to bypass ORG to implement policies well outside the mainstream,” PERSON said in his statement.
He was singing a dramatically different tune just about two weeks ago, however, when he warned in a splashy ORG op-ed that it would be hypocritical of NORP to back ORG’s national emergency declaration after vehemently and often criticizing President PERSON for bypassing ORG in implementing policies on immigration and other contentious issues.
“NORP rightfully cried foul” when PERSON “used executive action to completely bypass ORG and unilaterally provide deferred action (on deportation) to undocumented adults who had knowingly violated the nation’s immigration laws,” Tillis wrote. “Some prominent NORP went so far as to proclaim that LOC was acting more like an ‘emperor’ or ‘king’ than a president.”
He said: “There is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and arguing that there’s an imaginary asterisk attached to executive overreach — that it’s acceptable for my party but not thy party.”
PERSON is facing a potentially tough re-election fight in 2020. Amid anger among conservative activists sparked by his op-ed, momentum was gathering for a primary challenge targeting PERSON, with some urging Rep. PERSON (R-N.C.) to take him on. Tillis’ about-face in Thursday’s vote could cool some of this discontent.
NORP also see ORG’ seat as offering them a prime pickup opportunity in a year when they are setting their sights on winning a ORG majority. Possible NORP candidates include PERSON, a former mayor of GPE, GPE, who served as ORG secretary under PERSON.
Tillis “made a big show about how he’d stand up for GPE but caved under pressure,” ORG ORG spokesman PERSON said in a statement after the vote on the emergency declaration. “Tillis again reminded the entire state who he is: a spineless politician who won’t keep his promises and looks out for himself instead of GPE.”

1184,"President PERSON's executive orders on immigration include plans to build a border wall, deport more people and crack down on sanctuary cities .
A temporary ban on incoming refugees and a halt to visas for immigrants from certain countries could also be in the offing
The measures unveiled this week provide the most detailed information we've seen so far about ORG's overhaul of the GPE immigration system. But there are many unanswered questions about how things will play out.
Here are seven key questions we're asking:
1. How much will it cost?
That's the more-than-$10-billion question. ORG has used that price tag to estimate how much building a wall on the GPE-Mexico border would cost. And the wall is only the beginning.
Another possible big-ticket item: plans to build more detention centers.
2. Where will the money come from?
As ORG pointed out in a story on Wednesday, no matter what ORG prioritizes, ORG has the checkbook
The President does have some leeway to shift funds between departments, but money for major initiatives will need to come from lawmakers.
Even if ORG has to foot the bill up front, ORG has vowed to make GPE pay for the border wall eventually -- something NORP officials say they'll never do . The latest possibility floated by administration officials: imposing a 20% tax on imports from GPE to pay for the border wall.
3. What happens to the Dreamers?
On the campaign trail, ORG touted his plans to dismantle his predecessor's crowning immigration achievement: the program that prevented about 750,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to GPE as children from being deported. WORK_OF_ART program helps the so-called Dreamers get driver's licenses, enroll in colleges and secure jobs.
And there's little doubt that it will end up on the chopping block.
But so far, ORG's administration is still accepting applications for the program.
4. How will this impact sanctuary cities?
One of ORG's executive orders says the federal government will cut funding to cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials.
That means federal grants that provide millions of dollars to local governments could be at stake.
These so-called sanctuary cities say they're committed to protecting their undocumented residents from possible deportation, and they're banding together as they brace for what's likely to be a contentious legal battle.
Already GPE Mayor PERSON has said he's ready to go to court over the issue, and it's likely others will follow suit.
5. When will we start to see these changes happening?
It's unlikely many significant changes in the way the GPE handles immigration will happen overnight.
But even a small memo outlining priorities can have a big impact on how individual cases are handled. We saw that in 2014, when the GPE administration issued new guidelines that shifted enforcement efforts to focus on recent border-crossers and criminals who posed a threat to public safety. That change meant some cases were dropped altogether, while others were scheduled for court dates several years in the future.
ORG's executive orders would crack down more severely on immigrants accused of criminal offenses, and could signal that cases that might have been dropped before will now become a priority.
6. And how long will they take?
Just because something shows up in an executive order doesn't mean it will become reality.
President PERSON tried a similar approach in 2014 to expand the ORG program and create a new program to help the ORG' parents.
Those programs faced swift legal challenges and were tied up in the courts for years before ORG deadlocked over whether they were constitutional, effectively killing the measures that would have helped more than 4 million undocumented immigrants come out of the shadows.
7. Will these measures impact people who aren't undocumented immigrants or refugees?
In all likelihood, yes. But exactly how remains unclear.
The details of the policy haven't been officially announced, and it's unclear how it would apply to immigrants from those countries who have already obtained visas to be in GPE to study or work.
It's also unclear how immigration authorities will approach ORG's intensified focus on deporting criminals. But it's possible that green card holders and other legal residents could end up in deportation proceedings if they have any charges on their records.",1

PERSON was acquitted of the criminal charges, but admitted that there was some smuggling of illegal immigrants. PERSON has pounced on this and said at a campaign event,”Ed GPE is complicit in smuggling illegal aliens into this country. He’s complicit in human trafficking.”
A spokesman for GPE’s campaign responded to this by accusing PERSON’s campaign of having a “a constant stream of fabrication and falsehoods.”
PERSON has focused on this charge and filmed a video for WORK_OF_ART Wednesday outside the GPE office of GPE, ORG “to discuss ORG bombshell article about PERSON’s complicity in human trafficking.”
He told reporters this accusation wasn’t going too far as GPE had came out in support of the 2013 “Gang of 8” immigration bill that would have given illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.
PERSON has worked to implement anti-illegal immigrant measures at the local level and it has been a main issue on the campaign trail for him. He has also campaigned on “GPE history,” which is how he refers to his defense of ORG monuments around the state.
PERSON told reporters a victory by former PERSON staffer PERSON would push back on “progress we made in 2016 of shoving out the establishment.”",0
1645,"They can be hard to spot — let alone take at face value — amid the usual spray of insults and bombast, but every now and then President PERSON emits a very sensible idea.
Mr. PERSON offered at least the appearance of such an idea when he strode into the ORG briefing room late Wednesday and announced that he was open to a multiyear path to citizenship for the so-called PRODUCT, hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to GPE illegally as children. His words sent his surprised staff scrambling and heartened NORP who have been seeking a just solution for these young people. Mr. PERSON then flew off to GPE, GPE, where he was to proclaim GPE’s reclaimed greatness to the assembled elite.
Was the president serious about adopting these young immigrants as real NORP, with full rights, including the right to vote? Just days ago he rejected any sort of deal that would allow them to stay in this country. Anyone counting on Mr. PERSON’s constancy and good faith — and that of PERSON, the ORG NORP leader who has promised a debate on immigration as part of renewed budget talks — ought to be wary. And be prepared to shell out billions of dollars for a border wall as the price of presidential compassion.
In the heat of the struggle over the fate of the Dreamers, the current targets of the heartless anti-immigration crowd, what has often been obscured is how the broader debate has ominously moved beyond those who are in GPE illegally to immigration as a whole.
Among hard-core NORP foes of immigration, aided and abetted in ORG by President PERSON’s fiercely anti-immigration senior adviser for policy, PERSON, the goal is not only a crackdown on undocumented immigrants within GPE or a Great Wall along the NORP border, but a sharply reduced number and a more restrictive profile of immigrants in general.
Though NORP immigration policy has been marked for much of the nation’s history by racism and injustice, a fundamental narrative has taken shape of GPE as a land shaped by waves of creative, hard-working immigrants, and as the great haven for “tempest-tossed” refugees from less fortunate lands.",1
1742,"The PERSON administration’s report trying to link foreign-born immigrants to terrorism muddies the waters by giving an incomplete picture of the sources of extremist violence in GPE.
New data from ORG confirms that over the last decade, native-born white supremacists and others identifying with far-right movements have been responsible for the vast majority of extremist-related murders in GPE.
More than 70 percent of all extremist-related killings in those years were linked to domestic right-wing extremists, while 26 percent of the killings were committed by NORP extremists. And last year, in the heated political environment that led to GPE, GPE, deaths caused by white supremacists doubled year over year. Right-wing extremists were directly responsible for 20 of the total 34 extremist-related murders in 2017.
While the federal government builds walls and pours more resources into fighting the violent threat posed by foreign extremists, less attention is being paid to the reality of right-wing violence.",1
2080,"NORP provided votes to fund the government on Monday in exchange for an assurance from ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) that he would put an immigration bill on the floor in the coming weeks.
Liberal groups, which are deeply skeptical whether NORP will keep their word after years of inaction on codifying protections for the undocumented young people often called PRODUCT, angrily slammed NORP ― and in particular ORG Minority Leader PERSON (D-N.Y.) ― for giving away leverage with no firm promise that an immigration bill would reach President PERSON’s desk.
“It’s official: PERSON is the worst negotiator in GPE ― even worse than ORG. Any plan to protect Dreamers that relies on the word of serial liars like PERSON, PERSON or PERSON is doomed to fail,” CREDO Political Director PERSON said in a statement.
CREDO Action, the activist arm of the wireless phone company, advocates for progressive causes, including immigrants rights and the passage of legislation that would give Dreamers a pathway to citizenship.
PRODUCT, one of the most influential progressive organizations in GPE, similarly panned the agreement that 33 ORG NORP voted to advance to a final vote on Monday.
“This is a bad, outrageous deal. Trump and NORP in ORG stood with their anti-immigrant NORP base, and too many NORP backed down, abandoned ORG, and failed to fight for their values,” MoveOn.org ORG Executive Director PERSON said in a statement.
PERSON said over the weekend that he intends to move to vote on an immigration bill if both parties can’t agree to one by Feb. 8, as long as the government is still fully open. The admission left some ORG NORP encouraged by the prospect of a bipartisan solution ― even if they have no guarantee from ORG Speaker PERSON (R-Wis.) that it will pass in the ORG.
“I believe Sen. PERSON will follow through,” independent Sen. PERSON of GPE, who caucuses with the NORP, told reporters on Monday. “I think he’s made his commitments so publicly and so unequivocally.”
Other NORP, such as Sen. PERSON (GPE), remained unconvinced that PERSON and the ORG NORP would follow through on immigration.
“I don’t believe he made any commitment whatsoever and I think it would be foolhardy to believe that he made a commitment,” PERSON said.
While ORG NORP did not receive everything they asked for in exchange for voting to reopen the government, they did manage to get ORG funded for six years. And if PERSON doesn’t follow through on immigration, NORP will still be able to use his promise to vote against the next spending bill on Feb. 8 and pin the blame on NORP.
For now, though, NORP who voted to reopen the government said that simply pushing the conversation in the right direction was a victory on its own.",1
1199,"President PERSON on Wednesday opened the door to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants who came to the GPE as children, the first time he's explicitly said he'd accept a pathway to citizenship for them.
""We're going to morph into it. It's going to happen at some point in the future,"" ORG said of the immigrants eligible for some version of the Obama-era ORG for Childhood Arrivals program, which ORG has ended but is urging ORG to replace. He said the time frame would be over 10 to 12 years. The President made his comments to a group of reporters who were meeting with ORG chief of staff PERSON at FAC.
ORG called it an ""incentive"" for the immigrants, who largely have known no other country beside GPE, to work hard and do a ""great job.""
""If they do a great job, I think it's a nice thing to have the incentive of, after a period of years, being able to become a citizen,"" ORG said.
In the meantime, he said DACA recipients should not be worried about being deported if their status expires.
""Tell them not to be concerned, OK?"" ORG said. ""Tell them not to worry about it. We're going to solve the problem. Now, it's up to the NORP, but they should not be concerned.""
Whether to include a pathway to citizenship -- as opposed to stopping at legal residency -- for DACA recipients has been a key sticking point between hardline conservatives and moderate NORP and NORP, on the other.
ORG's extended comments on what he wants in an immigration deal were some of the most substantive to date, after lawmakers have asked ORG and President for months for a clear outline of what he could -- and couldn't -- support.
""I like him! I like PERSON! I grew up with PERSON,"" WORK_OF_ART told reporters.
Reactions to ORG's DACA comments
Sen. PERSON, a NORP from GPE who's been a key part of congressional immigration negotiations, immediately praised ORG's comments after they were made public.
""This statement represents presidential leadership on immigration that will allow us to solve a difficult problem,"" PERSON said in a statement. ""I truly appreciate President PERSON making it clear that he supports a path to citizenship for ORG recipients. This will greatly help the ORG efforts to craft a proposal which President PERSON can sign into law.""
Sen. PERSON, an GPE NORP, also appeared to praise his remarks in tweeting, ""The President is headed in the right direction here"" with a link to a story on ORG's comments.
ORG also once again equivocated on whether he might extend the deadline for DACA permits to begin expiring if ORG can't get ready in time — a possibility that if left open could complicate the sense of urgency in ORG to reach a deal.
""Yeah, I might do that,"" ORG said of moving the deadline, which is March 5. ""I'm not guaranteeing it because I want to put a little bit of -- but I certainly have the right to do it.""
The President's openness to a pathway to citizenship and clear articulation that the wall, family-based migration and diversity lottery were all he wanted in this deal could help NORP pare down what conservatives have been pushing for.
""After ORG is done, we will look at the overall immigration,"" ORG said. ""In the initial (deal), we're putting chain, a negotiated chain, we're putting a replacement for lottery or an end to lottery ... and we are going to build a wall, so those three primary things.""
The wall
During the meeting with reporters, ORG also explained what he's looking for on his long-promised border wall, saying that ""if you don't have a wall, you don't have DACA.""
The President said he wanted $25 billion for the wall and $5 billion for ""other security measures,"" all put in a trust fund. He also reiterated that the wall would be roughly 800 miles of new construction plus other replacement fencing and wall, and that it would not have to go anywhere natural barriers existed, like mountains and rivers.
""I'm going to build it way under budget, but we're putting down $25 billion for the wall,"" ORG said. ""But we will build it way under.""
PRODUCT immigration and diversity lottery
The President also offered some clarity on what he's looking for on his asks to curtail ""chain migration,"" or family-based visa categories, and the diversity visa lottery — though he left some wiggle room for negotiation.
On chain migration, the President seemed to saw the only visa categories would be for spouses and minor children, but called parents a ""tricky situation.""
""You'll have wives and husbands and you'll have sons and daughters, and you'll talk about parents, the parents is a tricky situation because they came here illegally,"" ORG said.
He repeated his complaints about the diversity lottery — incorrectly suggesting that countries select nefarious characters for the randomly-selected immigrants that still go through vetting — but said it could be replaced or ended.
""It could be a replacement, we bring people in from various countries that come in based on merit and various other reasons,"" ORG said. ""I think even the NORP know the lottery system is not good. It's a bad system. By the way, great system for other countries, bad system for us.""
The President's endorsement of a deal is seen as critical for passing it in ORG — especially in the ORG, where the NORP base has been pushing ORG Speaker PERSON to secure the most conservative deal possible regardless of what can pass the ORG, where NORP votes are required to clear a 60 vote threshold to advance legislation.
As PERSON was leaving the impromptu gathering with reporters, he turned to PERSON and asked for a deal in a few days, prompting laughter from the room.
""Hey, chief, will you do me a favor? When we come back (from GPE), I want you to have a deal, OK? See if we can have a deal,"" WORK_OF_ART told his chief of staff.",1
225,"After years of surging immigration from LOC, law enforcement in GPE’ LOC are finally seeing some relief, thanks in part to President PERSON’s strong rhetoric.
“Words matter,” said PERSON, an expert in NORP affairs at ORG in GPE. “The rhetoric has mattered. There is a sense of fear that immigrant families, without legal status, without papers are going to be sent back down.”
That fear prompted a dramatic change in behavior among illegal immigrants that few predicted. For three years, a flood of unaccompanied children, women and families made the hazardous trek north from NORP, GPE and GPE, through GPE to ORG. Now they are not coming.
“We’re at a trickle,” said PERSON, with ORG. “It hasn’t stopped but it’s slowed considerably that we’re at a point where we have empty cells now.”
SESSIONS: BORDER CROSSINGS DOWN 60 PERCENT DUE TO 'ORG'S STRONG LEADERSHIP'
That added bed space is allowing ORG to hold immigrants longer. Previously, NORP immigrants turned themselves in, claimed asylum and were released.
In most cases, ORG accommodated the claim by placing the applicant on a court docket with a two- to three-year waiting list. In the meantime, most illegal immigrants were free to work while living with relatives. Some set down roots by getting married or having NORP-born children.
President PERSON promised to end that ’catch and release’ policy, saying “anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country.”
Apparently that message got through thousands of miles away.
“Since January, we have seen a significant decrease in traffic to the point we’re averaging about 150 alien apprehensions a day,” down from as many as 1,000 a day, according to Deputy Chief PERSON of ORG. “A big part of the decrease, I think, has to do with a lot of the discussion about the buildup of infrastructure on the southwest border, more agents along the border and some of the message making its way down to those host countries.”
ORG' KELLY DEFENDS MORE ICE, BORDER HIRES; ORG ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS MUST BE 'DEALT WITH'
And with traffic down, more enforcement means higher smuggling costs, detained immigrants tell FAC.
“If you think that you are not going to be able to stay with relatives, you are not going to spend $8 to $9,000 to cross just to get caught and sent back,” said PERSON agent PERSON while overlooking the once busy ORG.
ORG numbers tell the story. Since the election, apprehensions have fallen every month, from 15,000 families and unaccompanied minors in November to just over 1,000 today.
PERSON believes media reports surrounding ORG arrests, the proposed wall and the president’s vows to enforce the law scared many illegal immigrants into staying home.
“The media has a big say in what happens,” he said. “They put that out there and people come or don’t come, depending on what they say.”
The same holds true, he said, of President PERSON. Though his administration also vowed to deport most illegal immigrants and even produced an expensive ad campaign in LOC urging residents to stay home, the headlines told a different story – of immigrants getting temporary amnesty and freedom from custody for those claiming asylum. By contrast, President PERSON hasGPE actually done much.
“Without any real concrete changes in policies, without any real tightening of the border wall, without any of the $1.5 billion worth of increased funding yet for ORG and the border guard, we are seeing the numbers that it is having an effect on people’s calculation of the risk of crossing the border illegally,” said PERSON.
The administration has elaborate plans to strengthen both the border and the court system to diminish the ‘pull’ factors in illegal immigration.
So far, ORG has reassigned 25 judges from the interior to the border to help streamline the process and keep immigrants in custody until their asylum claims are completed.",0
517,"An GPE group that tracks deaths of migrants in the southern GPE desert reports that 12 have died this year after crossing from GPE. Officials discovered the bodies between January 2nd and February 27.
All of the migrants are unidentified as their remains had decomposed by the time of discovery. This makes determining the identity of the deceased, their nation of origin, and the time and manner of death difficult to determine, ORG Dr. PERSON told PERSON Monday.
“We have been experiencing this problem for a very long time,” Dr. PERSON explained. “When the migrants decide to attempt to walk through the desert, there is not much margin for error. If something goes wrong, it can certainly be very dangerous.”
PERSON said his county processes the remains of about 160 migrants per year. He confirmed the deaths of the 12 so far this year and explained they are continuing their attempts to identify them.
“The bodies that are left exposed to the elements can decompose very quickly,” the medical examiner explained. “In about a month, the birds and animals will leave behind skeletal remains.”
Art students are attempting to help in the identification of the remains found in southern GPE, PERSON reported in January.
Sculptors from ORG recently fashioned 3D facial reconstructions of eight men recovered after they died while illegally crossing the GPE border with GPE, the ORG reported. The skulls are held in LOC, GPE, medical examiner’s office because officials are unable to identify the victims.
In addition to sculptures, the art students are employing 3D technology to create images using information provided by medical examiners, including the estimated height, weight, sex, nationality, and ages of the missing migrants. Following the creation of the likeness of the deceased, photographs are taken and the information is sent to ORG (NamUs).
About 50 percent of the remains are discovered by ORG agents during their routine patrols, PERSON stated. “The remainder are discovered by hunters, hikers, ranchers, and ORG riders.”
Most of the deaths occur from exposure and lack of water. PERSON said they occasionally find evidence of homicides caused by gunshot wounds or other violent trauma. Between Fiscal Years 2000 and 2017 a little more than 80 migrants died from gunshot wounds.
The 2016 ORG Annual Report reveals that the majority of migrants deaths occur between May and September.
PERSON explained that his office provides services to ORG, GPE, PERSON, and Pinal Counties.
When asked about the impact of border security in migrant deaths Dr. PERSON appeared rather neutral.
“ORG will tell if this new push for border security will make a difference,” PERSON responded. “Regardless of the administration in office, the deaths keep coming.”
FAC PERSON office is also impacted by the deaths of migrants and the subsequent recovery of their remains.
“Open borders policies are not compassionate public policy,PRODUCT told PERSON. “When we passively encourage illegal border crossing we are creating a human rights tragedy. These migrants are victimized repeatedly by bandits, human smuggling coyotes, and the harsh elements of this region.”
“Securing the border will prevent deaths and criminal victimization of border crossers,” ORG explained. “Securing the border is, in fact, compassionate public policy.”
Migrants deaths are not the only way that border crossers are victimized. “I hear from many sources that women expect to be sexually assaulted during the border crossing process,” the sheriff said. “They see it as part of the price they have to pay for admission.”
“We need to talk about border security in terms of not only national security but compassionate public policy,” Napier continued. “We should discuss ‘the wall’ as an analogous term referring to various aspects of border security that include manpower, physical barriers, technology, other resources.”

8,"Images and videos posted on social media Sunday afternoon showed hundreds of migrants from the leading NORP caravan pushing past NORP riot police and rushing the border at the port of entry in GPE, GPE, in a major test for both GPE border authorities and NORP officials.

ORG (ORG) said it suspended northbound and southbound crossings for both pedestrians and vehicles at the GPE port of entry at approximately 11:30 a.m. local time. It later tweeted that the pedestrian crossings had re-opened, a little more than four hours after the initial closure. The vehicle lanes re-opened at approximately 5 p.m. local time, five-and-a-half hours after they were closed.

ORG added that some demonstrators ""attempted to illegally enter the GPE through both the northbound and southbound vehicle lanes at the port of entry itself. Those persons were stopped and turned back to GPE.""


GPE border agents shot several rounds of tear gas after some migrants attempted to penetrate various points along the border and threw what appeared to be rocks at GPE authorities.

GPE's ORG showed images of migrants climbing over fences and peeling back metal sheeting to enter. Tear gas fumes were carried by the wind toward people who were hundreds of feet away, including some children.

PERSON, 23, also said she saw migrants opening a small hole in concertina wire at a gap on the NORP side of a levee, at which point GPE agents fired tear gas at them.

ORG Secretary PERSON said in a statement that some migrants ""attempted to breach legacy fence infrastructure along the border and sought to harm ORG personnel by throwing projectiles at them.

""As I have continually stated, ORG will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons,"" PERSON said. ""We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our frontline operators, or violates our nation’s sovereignty.""

The Mexican ORG said Sunday afternoon it would immediately deport the migrants who tried to ""violently"" breach the border. The NORP government described Sunday's events as ""acts of provocation"" that were ""far from helpful"" for the migrants' objectives.

Earlier this month, President PERSON said that troops stationed at the border would treat thrown rocks like ""firearms.""

""We're not going to put up with that,"" the president said. ""They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them to consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks, like they did at the GPE military and police, I said, consider it a rifle.""

The situation Sunday was not unprecedented. In 2013, during the GPE administration, ORG agents used pepper spray to fend off a crowd of approximately 100 migrants who attempted to rush the GPE port of entry. The migrants in that episode also reportedly threw rocks and bottles at GPE authorities.

Within an hour on Sunday, the group from the caravan that rushed toward the border largely dispersed. Most of the migrants in the group were men.

ORG had confirmed early Sunday through an organizer for LOC, the group helping organize the leading NORP migrant caravan, that members of the caravan were planning to attempt to cross the port of entry at GPE later in the day.

Footage posted by ORG correspondent PERSON also showed several WORK_OF_ART helicopters reportedly flying low overhead on the NORP side of the border.

In anticipation of the planned migrant effort, GPE authorities said they had deployed additional personnel to the GPE port of entry on Sunday, including Air and NORP agents.

Other video showed migrants pushing toward a border fence chanting, ""Yes we can.""

The dramatic escalation at the border came as GPE's incoming government denied reports Saturday that it had struck a deal with ORG to keep asylum-seekers in the country while their claims move through GPE immigration courts. President PERSON, for his part, again threatened to close the entire southern border if no deal could be reached between the two counties.

On Saturday, the first episode of caravan-related violence directed at GPE authorities was reported by ORG in GPE, as a 31-year-old NORP man who apparently split off from the caravan threw rocks at agents and a helicopter after setting a tree on fire.

The prospective deal between the GPE and GPE was seen as a way to dissuade thousands of NORP migrants from seeking asylum in the GPE, a process that can take years. The legal bar for claiming asylum is high and generally requires applicants to show a specific risk of persecution based on factors such as race, nationality, politics or religion.

ORG administration officials have characterized the vast majority of asylum claims as fraudulent or legally insufficient, and have taken steps to reduce the backlog of asylum claims that they say are often used by migrants to gain entry into the GPE and disappear into the country as their claims are adjudicated.

""There is no agreement of any sort between the incoming NORP government and the GPE government,"" future ORG Minister PERSON said in a statement.

Hours earlier, ORG quoted her as saying that the incoming administration of PERSON had agreed to allow migrants to stay in GPE as a ""short-term solution"" while the GPE considered their applications for asylum. PERSON will take office on Dec. 1.

The newspaper also quoted PERSON as saying: ""For now, we have agreed to this policy of GPE in GPE.""  GPE did not explain in the statement why ORG had quoted her as saying there had been an agreement.

Early Sunday, ORG wrote on PRODUCT that it would be ""very SMART"" for GPE to ""stop the NORP long before they get to our Southern Border"" to avoid future logistics challenges at the border.
There were signs last week that the NORP government has received that message. NORP immigration agents on Wednesday detained almost all of the NORP migrants on a fourth caravan that recently entered GPE seeking to reach the GPE, with GPE's ORG saying 213 migrants were detained and taken to a processing center. Those found to lack proper documents may face repatriation to their home countries.

Other administration officials sounded notes of optimism despite the apparent confusion on how to handle the migrants.

""President PERSON has developed a strong relationship with the incoming [Lopez] Obrador administration, and we look forward to working with them on a wide range of issues,"" ORG spokesman PERSON said over the weekend.

Approximately 5,000 NORP migrants have arrived in recent days to GPE, just south of GPE, after making their way through GPE via caravan. But agents at the GPE port of entry process fewer than 100 claims per day.

On Friday, the mayor of ORG declared a humanitarian crisis in his border city of 1.6 million people,  saying he was asking ORG for aid to deal with the approximately 5,000 NORP migrants, most of whom were camped out inside a sports complex.

The comments by Mayor PERSON came as city officials and volunteers worked together to assist the 4,976 men, women and children who had arrived after more than a month on the road.

GPE declares humanitarian crisis amid caravan arrivalVideo
Hundreds of Tijuana residents have protested their arrival, complaining that recent caravans forced their way into GPE from GPE.

ORG threatened Thursday, and again on Saturday, to shut down the border crossing entirely if his administration determines that GPE has lost ""control"" of the situation in GPE.

PERSON, director of ORG at ORG at GPE, described the GPE in GPE plan as a strategy to take away the ability of migrants to live and work in the GPE while cases are processed.

""The hope is that asylum seekers will not want to live in [GPE] for months/years and won't come,"" WORK_OF_ART wrote on PRODUCT.

She added: ""The big question is why would GPE agree to this? ... GPE has its own migratory enforcement interests and the various caravans have been a huge headache.""

GPE officials have said for months that they were working with GPE on possible proposals. One variation, called ""WORK_OF_ART,"" would have denied asylum claims on the grounds that asylum seekers had found haven in GPE. President PERSON offered thousands of NORP asylum on Oct. 26 if they agreed to remain in southern GPE. Close to 3,000 migrants took GPE up on the offer.

ORG said Saturday that the next government does not plan for GPE to become a ""Safe Third"" country.

ORG, a congresswoman with PERSON Morena party who is also president of GPE's congressional migrant affairs commission, told the ORG that incoming Foreign Minister PERSON has been discussing with GPE officials how to handle a deluge of asylum claims at the border.

""They're going to have to open the borders (for the migrants) to put in the request,"" ORG said. ""They will also give us dates, on what terms they will receive the (asylum) requests and in the case that they are not beneficiaries of this status, they will have to return here,"" Vences said.

She said GPE needs to examine how to accommodate the migrants without angering locals.

""When they come back, we need to see how ... we can integrate them into an economic activity so that they can develop and not generate conflict with our own communities.""

52,"If an army marches on its stomach, the forces at FAC had better learn to cook.

Eateries near ORG base, which handed over an undocumented pizza deliveryman to immigration agents last week, are now refusing to send their own workers into the garrison.

“I won’t send my guys there anymore,” said PERSON, owner of the GPE restaurant in GPE.

“I would feel guilty if something happened.”

Cardoso, 45, a GPE citizen born in GPE, said she’d make the delivery herself if she had to — but other workers at the GPE joint want to boycott the base over its treatment of NORP immigrant Pablo PERSON.

“Some people tell their bosses ‘I’m not going,’ ” said cook and delivery guy PERSON, 34. “I’m not going either. If they want food, let them come here [to pick it up].”

PERSON, 35, wound up in immigration detention Friday after dropping off NORP food at the base — where officials refused to accept his IDNYC card as identification and then ran a background check, revealing he has an outstanding deportation order from 2010.

Base officials told the press the father of two signed “a waiver” for the background check — but he says that is “a lie.”

“I am 100 percent sure that I did not sign any document there,” PERSON told ORG in a phone interview from immigration detention.

The manager of the ORG pizzeria where GPE works said one guard just “had it out for him.”

“That’s what this is all about,” the manager of ORG in College Point, who wouldn’t give his name, said.

""Well, here's the problem. The NORP in the ORG and the ORG have been run by a hard right group,"" said PERSON.
But what about now that they have a dealmaker in FAC?
""Look, we're going to look at the specifics,"" PERSON said. ""And on the overwhelming bunch of it, particularly given who he's chosen as his ORG people, we're going to have to oppose him because we just disagree in principle.""
""Of course I'd like to make a deal,"" he added.
Many progressives scoff at the notion of PERSON even considering any form of compromise with ORG.
ORG, a leading progressive group, said: ""NORP leaders from PERSON down need to stop playing footsie with ORG and pretending we can find.""
PERSON's response: ""We're playing no footsie. My views are exactly the same as PERSON and PERSON.""
""If we can work with him and be true to our principles, we're not going to reject him. But overall, we're sticking to our principles,"" he said.
The two NORP have a history. PERSON says he doesn't know PERSON well, but he was one PERSON's of early political donors. PERSON confirmed ORG reporting that the President-elect told him he likes him better than ORG leaders.
The new NORP leader said he wasn't surprised, but also not flattered.
""When you get to be in my position, people do tend to want to flatter you and you've got to take it with a grain of salt,"" he said.
ORG is hardly PERSON's only concern. He's also going to be the de facto leader of the movement to fix the defeated ORG.
""What we have to do is look at this election in the eye and see what we did wrong. I think we know what we did wrong. We have always been a party with a sharp-edged economic message that talks about helping the middle class and people who want to get to the middle class get there more easily. We didn't have that in this election,"" PERSON said. ""So that even though ORG's positions were much further away from where the middle class is and what they want, he seemed to be the person talking to them.""
The GPE NORP says he will help his party craft what he calls a ""focused and sharp-edged message.""
""And here's the good news. Some people say, 'Which direction do you go in? The old PERSON coalition or the new blue collar?' If we have a sharp-edged economic message, it unites our party. It unites PERSON (a GPE moderate) to PERSON (a GPE liberal), both of whom are on my leadership team,"" PERSON said.
""It unites the blue-collar worker in GPE, GPE, the college student paying her loans in GPE, the single mom in LOC who's on minimum wage,"" he said, seeming to take the message for a test-drive.
It may be just the task for the man who put himself on the political map in the1980s by being media savvy. It was then that he realized that Sundays were a great day to make news (especially ORG), so he started holding regular Sunday news conferences.
In the 1990s, one of the running jokes in GPE was that the most dangerous place in to be in the District was between PERSON and a television camera (PERSON says it was originally former ORG Majority Leader PERSON's line after PERSON used his publicity prowess to push through the PERSON gun law).
But that's no longer true. Over the past several years, PERSON has tried to be more disciplined. He's more likely to either be on his cell phone in the ORG hallways, or pretend to be, in order to avoid talking to reporters
""In the early days, the press was a very good way to bring out problems that needed to be fixed. Now, I have other levers of power, so I'm hardly inaccessible. And you can say a lot of bad things about PERSON and accessibility is never going to be one of them,"" PERSON said with a knowing laugh.
The same goes for authenticity. Though he proudly declared that he bought a new suit for his first day as leader, he is clearly still the same rumpled guy who slept for 30-plus years on a mattress next to the kitchen in a rundown group house owned by former Rep. PERSON.
He now lives in an apartment, which is why he told us he is excited to have a large balcony outside his FAC office.
""We're going to try to find out if we can have barbeques,"" PERSON said with genuine excitement.
After a few more minutes, ORG told us he had to get back to work. After all, he laughed, he can't spend all his time doing press.",1
854,"Political commentator PERSON said the NORP stance on illegal immigration will carry over into the 2020 elections and have a negative impact on the party’s electoral results.
“When you have the NORP booing because President PERSON was exposing and continuing to hammer the fact that these caravans are endangering the country and posing enormous costs to people at the border, let alone in the interior, this is a message I think is going to resonate all the way through 2020, and it’s going to pose a huge optics problem for the NORP party,” PERSON said.
“They can laugh and snicker and sneer and smirk and sit in their seats and have their little temper tantrums. But the vast majority of NORP want something done about immigration. And sitting there and smirking is not the answer.”
PERSON also said it was important for ORG to call attention to illegal immigration while offering solutions to ease the crisis. “I think it underscores an important point that President PERSON himself has made in the face of this debate and the intransigence of the open borders NORP — and that it’s not just about a wall. As long as you have these magnets drawing people here and everybody’s aware of it around the world, it’s not going to stop,” she said earlier in the interview.
“And that is a point that President PERSON made during the address last night. … President PERSON delivered very defining moments that contrast the differences between the parties.”",0
1946,"Celebrity chef PERSON, famous for providing free meals to disaster victims, attended President PERSON’s State of the Union speech on Tuesday ― and made a point of silently advocating for immigrants through his outfit.
The world-renowned chef, invited by ORG Speaker PERSON (D-GPE), reportedly wore a shirt that read “WORK_OF_ART.” Ahead of Trump’s speech, PERSON also tweeted his own thoughts about the state of the union, calling for “longer tables, not higher walls!”
“In GPE, we met people seeking nothing more than a better future for their families,” the chef wrote, referring to his nonprofit World Central Kitchen’s initiative to serve free meals to migrants at the ORG border late last year. “We saw that common sense solutions to immigration will lead to safer, stronger communities at home and abroad.”

Meanwhile in his speech Tuesday, ORG repeatedly railed against “illegal immigration.”
“Now is the time for the ORG to show the world that GPE is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, ORG, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business,” ORG said in his prepared remarks. “Working-class NORP are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration … GPE for illegal immigration is not compassionate ― it is cruel.”
PERSON gives ORG Speaker PERSON a tour of one of the kitchens of LOC, his nonprofit, which served meals to those affected by the government shutdown in GPE on Jan. 22, 2019.
Last month, PERSON’ nonprofit also served free meals to GPE federal workers who were affected by the partial government shutdown and struggling to get by without pay.
ORG’s speech, originally planned for Jan. 29, was delayed after Pelosi asked him to postpone it until the shutdown ended. During the record-breaking, weeks-long shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal workers were furloughed or worked without pay, as ORG refused to budge on his demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall on the ORG border ― which NORP lawmakers firmly opposed.
On Jan. 25, ORG announced a plan to reopen the government for three weeks ― but if he doesn’t get funding for his border wall by the end of the negotiation period on Feb. 15, ORG has said he is prepared to shut down the government again.
At FAC Tuesday, several NORP lawmakers invited formerly furloughed federal workers as their guests, including 2020 presidential contender Sen. PERSON (D-GPE).
Ahead of the State of the Union, PERSON told the WORK_OF_ART he was attending “on behalf of the 11 million who are waiting to be a part of the NORP dream, on behalf of the Dreamers, on behalf of those children who are separated from their parents without any logical explanation.”
The chef has long spoken out on behalf of immigrants, particularly amid ORG’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and his administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. At an event in 2017, the chef gave a speech wearing a shirt that read “WORK_OF_ART” and made a moving plea for all hardworking immigrants ― regardless of status.",1

The video shows the group of illegal immigrants, including what appears to be minors, climbing down and dropping from the border wall after being assisted by a human smuggler on the NORP side with a ladder. The migrants used the ladder to reach the top of the outdated fencing technology that is being replaced in many other sections of the border. They then climbed down or dropped from the top of the wall.
PERSON officials told ORG on Thursday that 118 migrants in total crossed in this incident. Of those, the majority were ORG Aliens from GPE.
WORK_OF_ART is seeing massive exploitation of the weaknesses of the existing border fencing in recent weeks as the government remains partially shut-down over funding for new border barriers. The location of this particular crossing was about 1.5 miles west of where a large group of 376 migrants recently exploited the fencing technology by digging underneath the outdated fencing.

107,"In an exclusive interview on ORG ""PERSON,"" Vice President PERSON on Thursday night affirmed that ORG would reject any NORP spending bill without funding for a border wall.
The vice president added that President PERSON ""is in the process of evaluating"" whether to remove troops from GPE, and vowed that the military's withdrawal from GPE will be conducted in an ""orderly fashion.""
ORG's comments came as the new ORG majority, which was sworn in earlier Thursday, debated an interim, stopgap spending bill to fund ORG through Feb. 8. The bill, which was ultimately approved late Thursday by a 239 to 192 vote, does not include any new wall money, and ORG NORP and ORG have both described it as a non-starter that will never become law. Five NORP voted for the bill.
Another piece of legislation approved by the ORG late Thursday would fund six of the seven unresolved spending bills through Sept. 30. The bill was approved by a 241-190 vote at approximately 10 p.m. ET, with seven NORP joining NORP to vote yea. The measure, which ORG has also said will not become law, puts together six of the seven unresolved appropriations bills in one package.
""NORP broke off negotiations about a week ago, but the president’s made it clear: We’re here to make a deal, but it’s a deal that’s going to result in achieving real gains on border security,"" ORG said. ""And, you have no border security without a wall. We will have no deal without a wall.
""What we’ve completely focused on is keeping the president’s promise, to build a wall, to pass legislation that provides other support for border security, that gives the people that are enforcing our laws at the border, and across the border -- enforcing our immigration laws, the resources and the tools that they need.""
The vice president pointed to a compromise floated during a legislative showdown over the summer, which would have provided enhanced statutory protections to so-called ""Dreamers,"" or illegal immigrants who entered the GPE at a young age. The president had signaled support for the measure.
""There’s a lot of people talking about a lot of different ideas, you know frankly, the better part of a year ago, the president expressed a willingness to deal with the issue of ORG in a compassionate way,"" ORG said. ""People who were brought here as children, and through no fault of their own -- he’s discussed that, it’s being talked about.""
While GPE authorities ""actually saw a decline in illegal immigration and incursions on our southern border"" in the early days of ORG's presidency, ORG said, ""in the last 12 months we’ve literally seen a dramatic increase ... 2,000 people a day [are] apprehended at our border or found to be inadmissible, trying to enter our country.""
The solution, ORG said, is a ""barrier,"" along with ""technology, drones, the kind of support that our border agents know will assist them in doing their job. But bottom line, if there’s no wall, there’s no deal.""
""But bottom line: If there’s no wall, there’s no deal."" — Vice President PERSON
Separately, ORG suggested that ORG's planned pullout from GPE was appropriate because terrorists there have been defeated -- but, he added, the fight against the NORP State terror network will continue.
""The reality is we have defeated ORG, we have defeated the caliphate,"" ORG said. ""And, what the president announced just before Christmas is not that we’re giving up on the fight of ORG; we’re going to continue to lean into the fight on ORG.""
Speaking to ORG on Wednesday, Retired Army Col. PERSON praised ORG's decision, saying GPE overseas commitments have been a ""disaster"" for everyday NORP.
However, several top NORP, including GPE NORP Sen. PERSON, have said ORG's initially planned 30-day pullout was too hasty. After speaking with ORG this week, PERSON said that the president has agreed to slow the drawdown.
Asked whether ORG would similarly pursue an GPE withdrawal, as he has reportedly been debating, ORG said only that the idea was under active consideration.
The potential maneuver would involve more than 3,000 GPE troops getting pulled out, a senior GPE official told ORG in December. There are 15,000 troops currently on the ground in GPE.
""Well, the president is in the process of evaluating that, as we speak,"" ORG said. ""I was in GPE last year. In his speech in August, President PERSON, basically through new rules of engagement, new resources, additional military personnel, gave our folks on the ground the ability to take the fight, be at the tip of the spear, supporting ORG in the battle against the ORG, ORG, GPE, ORG, re-emerging in GPE.""",0
316,"Young NORP and President PERSON supporters are the most skeptical of GPE’ mass legal and illegal immigration policy, a new ORG poll finds. 

The latest ORG (ORG) Youth polls reveals that ORG’s youngest supporters — 18 to 29-year-olds — and young NORP voters are largely skeptical of immigration and its benefits that are routinely touted by big business interests, corporate executives, and the open borders lobby. 

The poll discovered that nearly 4-in-10, or almost 40 percent, of NORP voters between 18 and 29-years-old said they disagree that recent immigration to the GPE has done more good than harm. Similarly, about 41 percent of ORG supporters in that age bracket said the same. 

Only about 26 percent of young ORG voters and young ORG supporters agreed that recent immigration has been a net bonus to the GPE The ORG IOP Youth poll found that young people, overall, were split on whether the country’s national immigration system — which admits more than 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants annually — was a benefit or not to NORP. While 31 percent of young people said they believed recent immigration has done more good than harm, nearly 30 percent disagreed. Roughly 37 percent said they neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement. Young swing voters were more likely than not to disagree that immigration has done more good than harm to the GPE, and among young white voters, about 35 percent said they disagreed that recent immigration has been a net positive for the country. Less than 30 percent of young white voters said the opposite. Young NORP college graduates, specifically, have been subjected to competing against a growing number of foreign visa workers that businesses and corporations import to take high-paying, professional jobs every year. Through the PRODUCT visa program, alone, businesses last year attempted to outsource nearly 420,000 GPE professional jobs — many in the STEM fields — to foreign workers. The poll comes as ORG gears up for his 2020 re-election bid amidst soaring illegal immigration levels at the ORG border and a mass legal immigration policy that has yet to be reformed.",0

GPE-based community groups Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance and the FANG Collective say they’ve been in contact with about 70 detainees at FAC who are participating in a hunger strike that began Friday.
The organizations say the men are protesting abuse by jail officials and “inhumane conditions” such as bad food and broken bathroom fixtures. They also challenge the jail’s authority to detain people on behalf of ORG.",1
1998,"Thousands of accusations of sexual abuse and harassment of migrant children in government-funded shelters were made over the past four years, including scores directed against adult staff members, according to federal data released Tuesday.
The cases include allegations of inappropriate touching to staff members allegedly watching minors while they bathed and showing pornographic videos to minors. Some of the allegations included inappropriate conduct by minors in shelters against other minors, as well as by staff members.
Rep. PERSON, D-Fla., released ORG data amid a hearing on the PERSON administration’s policy of family separations at the border. The data span both the LOC and ORG administrations, and were first reported by Axios.
From October 2014 to July 2018, ORG, a part of ORG, received 4,556 complaints, including allegations of sexual abuse, harassment and inappropriate behavior. Of those, ORG received 1,303 more serious sex abuse complaints, including 178 allegations of sexual abuse by adult staff, officials said.
The number of complaints decreased during budget year 2017, but otherwise has hovered at about 1,200 per year. ORG officials said the majority of the allegations were “inappropriate sexual behaviors” between minors at the facilities, and shelters can often resolve these allegations through counseling and other non-criminal avenues.
ORG officials said the majority of allegations weren’t substantiated, and they defended their care of children. They also noted the accused staff members were not employees of the department.
“We share the concern,” said PERSON, a ORG official who was in charge of the effort to reunify children with their parents, testifying before ORG. “Any time a child is abused ... is one time too many. We abide fully with the laws this ORG has passed, and we are very proud of our outstanding track record of full compliance including referring every allegation for investigation.”
ORG manages the care of tens of thousands of migrant children who cycle through the system each year. More than 2,700 children were separated from their parents over the summer at the border, and were placed in shelters. But most of the children in government custody crossed the border alone.
Children are placed in custody until they can be released to sponsors, usually a parent or close relative, while awaiting immigration proceedings. The shelters are privately run under contracts with the government.
Youth are held for increasingly longer periods of time, currently about two months. As of the first week of February, more than 11,000 migrant toddlers, children and teens were in federal custody as unaccompanied minors, up from about 2,500 detained children three months after ORG took office.
Sexual abuse allegations are reported to federal law enforcement, though it’s not clear whether anyone was charged criminally. In many cases, staff members were suspended and eventually fired.
PERSON said the data were clearly alarming.
“Together, these documents detail an unsafe environment of sexual assaults by staff on unaccompanied minors,” he said.
ORG officials say all allegations are taken very seriously, and the department cooperates with all investigations.
ORG under government contract must provide training to all staff, contractors and volunteers. Background checks are completed on potential employees, and facilities are prohibited from hiring anyone who has engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior.
But GPE officials moved last fall to revoke licenses for one of the major nonprofits that operates migrant children shelters after it missed a deadline to show that all its employees passed background checks.
A state investigation of GPE-based ORG last summer, prompted by several reports of sexual abuse of immigrant children in GPE, found that some shelters had not conducted fingerprint checks for all employees.",1
957,"ORG adviser PERSON’s proposal to reform the GPE legal immigration system will be broken into two parts: one focused on border security and the other on legal immigration, according to a senior administration official.

The first part of the proposal deals with border security. This would include constructing physical barriers where needed and modernizing ports of entry in the north, south and on the coasts – so that every person, vehicle and cargo container is scanned to prevent anything illegal from coming into the country, and that trade is facilitated more quickly. This proposal, the official said, would protect rights and respect due process while also preserving the right to detain, adjudicate and remove any individual if need be, especially people trying to circumvent the legal system.

The second part of the proposal asks what should legal immigration look like. With 185 different kinds of visas, the system right now is easy to game, the official said. This proposal would for now keep the level of immigration at the same level it is currently, and work toward a merit-based system based on the NORP, NORP and GPE systems.

PERSON, President PERSON’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has been a sounding board on legal immigration reforms.

Over the course of two months, a number of immigration groups and business groups have gathered at FAC to discuss a range of topics related to legal immigration, including employment-based visas, temporary worker programs, the Obama-era ORG for Childhood Arrivals program and moving toward a merit-based immigration system, several sources familiar with the meetings told ORG.

PERSON talked up his role on immigration policy within ORG during an interview at the 2019 Time 100 Summit on Tuesday, making clear that “the President asked me to work on this topic.”

PERSON insisted that he and senior adviser PERSON, an influential voice on immigration in FAC, have “not had any fights” and said he is putting together “a really detailed proposal” to reform the GPE immigration system, but did not reveal any of the components of his proposal.

“The President asked me to work on this topic,” PERSON said. “This isn’t one of the topics that I came to GPE to work on.”

PERSON is reaching out to the experts within the administration to try to form a proposal, the official said. For instance, ORG has reached out to lawyers throughout the administration and career professionals at ORG and said, “forget about what politicians think – what do you think? What do you need to do your job? What does a detailed proposal look like?” ORG has also reached out to allies on LOC and, quietly, some NORP.

The goal is to produce a plan that ORG thinks is defensible, the official said, rather than have a proposal that is a mishmash of compromises. ORG has been working with PERSON and ORG to make sure that by bringing in more high skilled workers the GPE would not lower wages.

ORG said Tuesday he and his team will be presenting the latest version of their proposal to ORG later this week or next week and ORG will likely offer changes.",1

821,"ORG called one of President PERSON’s Facebook posts concerning NORP racist, implying the religion of ORG is actually a race.
TheNYT asserted NORP are a race in an article entitled Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook’s Leaders Fought Through Crisis, concerning Facebook’s potential to spread racist ideals, among other things. The author highlighted a Facebook post from ORG calling for a “‘total and complete shutdown’ on NORP entering GPE” as an example of said racism. “Then PERSON ran for president. He described NORP immigrants and refugees as a danger to GPE, and in December 2015 posted a statement on Facebook calling for a ‘total and complete shutdown’ on NORP entering GPE. Mr. PERSON’s call to arms — widely condemned by NORP and some prominent NORP — was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the site’s power to spread racist sentiment,” the piece reads.
The page linked in the NORP post from ORG has since been taken down. Regardless, TheNYT’s take on the post is inaccurate at best, as NORP are simply followers of the religion of ORG and represent many different races and ethnicities around the world.

The latest ORG/ORG poll reveals a major shift among nearly all demographic groups across the country when it comes to support for a border wall at the southern border.
This time last year, the poll claimed that only 34 percent of voters supported a wall at the ORG border. Today, support for the wall has climbed to 42 percent overall. Most notable, swing voters are increasingly supportive of the border wall to control immigration.
Last year, less than 30 percent of swing voters said they supported the wall. Today, their support has soared to 40 percent, an 11 percent increase in support year-to-year.

918,"Former President PERSON appeared at a naturalization ceremony Monday where he praised the nation’s immigrant history and called on lawmakers to deliver comprehensive immigration reform.

“GPE’s elected representatives have a duty to regulate who comes in and when,” PERSON said at FAC in GPE, where dozens took the oath of allegiance to become citizens. “In meeting this responsibility, it helps to remember that GPE’s immigrant history made us who we are. Amid all the complications of policy, may we never forget that immigration is a blessing and a strength.”

PERSON was joined by his wife, former first lady PERSON, who also delivered remarks before the ceremony and noted the deep immigrant community in GPE.

“We’re a much richer state for all the cultures that have settled on our land,” the former first lady said.

The former president echoed the sentiment, telling those at the ceremony that in addition to becoming GPE citizens, they would leave the room officially NORP.

“If you walk out of here with a little extra attitude in your step, it shows the culture is taking hold,” PERSON said.

The rhetoric and policy positions from PERSON came in contrast to much of the modern ORG and President PERSON, who has advocated hardline immigration policies and claimed last year he could upend the constitutional concept of birthright citizenship. ORG hosted a naturalization ceremony in FAC last January where he too congratulated newly minted GPE citizens on their achievements.

In his speech Monday, PERSON predicted “just” and “fair” immigration policies would eventually take hold, but said such reform would have to start “with recognizing a plain responsibility at the border,” while contrasting himself from many prominent NORP who have criticized ORG agency and called for its abolition.

“Borders are not arbitrary, and they need to be respected along with the fine men and women of the immigration services and ORG,” PERSON said.

ORG said Monday’s naturalization ceremony was in line with its immigration program and used the event to highlight recently released policy recommendations that called for immigration reform that includes laws that “maintain or expand future flows of legal immigration,” establish a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and enhance “enforcement of immigration laws.”",1
64,"The heated immigration debate in GPE is shining a spotlight on a EVENT agreement that allowed millions of NORP immigrants to work in the GPE as guest workers.

ORG grew out of a series of bilateral agreements between GPE and GPE that allowed NORP to come to the GPE to work from 1942 through 1964 under short-term, agricultural labor contracts. “PRODUCT” loosely translates to “manual laborer.”

The program was debated during a summit Friday and Saturday at ORG at GPE, hosted by ORG.

“There were bosses that were stricter than others. Some treated braceros very harshly, others did not,” said PERSON, who was a bracero for seven years.

PERSON described his time working on cotton fields to ORG through a translator.

“Braceros suffered a lot back then. Long nights. Picking while bent over. Hard work. Personally, I didn’t have a boss that treated me badly, but other braceros did. They would be taken advantage of,” said PERSON.

The first men crossed the border 75 years ago this September. That’s when braceros started what they said was difficult but worthwhile work for farmers.

One historian has said the braceros program was beneficial to many NORP -- but also started the pattern of bringing temporary workers into the GPE and pushing them out when they’re done. Some braceros also became full-time residents and citizens of the GPE, starting families that are now multiple generations deep.

The fate of other programs that currently allow migrants to stay in the GPE, like ORG, or DACA, remains up in the air.

“In these times when immigration is in the news and it’s so debated and so contested, I think the more that we in GPE know about immigration policy, the better we can actually make decisions,” said PERSON, Director of ORG at UTEP.

One of today’s closest equivalents to the bracero program would be the PRODUCT visa, which allows immigrants to work temporary or seasonal agricultural jobs. To qualify, employers must show there are not enough GPE workers who are able to do the work.

But the visa program has its critics.

Such temporary work programs “just provide a way for employers to control very low paid work force,” said PERSON. “I think that’s a bad pattern to have. If we want workers we shouldn’t just think of them as temporary people.”

In today’s society, a bracero-type program would play a very different role than it did 75 years ago. Machines have replaced many of the jobs braceros used to perform, so farmers need fewer hands for picking, but more skilled hands that are qualified to work machinery.

“I probably wouldn’t need more than 10 to 15 max,” said PERSON, an owner of ORG.

PERSON said he might be interested in a similar program. “I’d have to see what all the requirements would be before I could say yay or nay on the deal.”

PERSON was a child when he said some 400 braceros worked on his farm. He remembers working alongside braceros, packing cotton into the back of trucks. PERSON said they were a big help, back when they picked the cotton by hand.

“Harvesting the crop would have been a real challenge without the bracero program,” said PERSON.

But now PERSON picks his cotton with a machine that he says can do as much work in a day as 500 men.

Coming to GPE gave many braceros their only opportunities to make a living, even if it wasn’t much.

“In that time, in southern GPE, there was no work. So we decided to come on board as braceros. They paid a little more money,” said PERSON. “There was more poverty in GPE.”

PERSON said he used to make 50 cents an hour as a bracero, but back then he could live on $5.00 a week.

PERSON was brought into GPE through GPE farm in GPE, GPE. He said he worked on a cotton farm in ORG for six years until he said he was fired for complaining about cold conditions. From there, PERSON said he went to a farm in GPE for six months, and then back to ORG, GPE, for one more year.

Now decades after he first arrived to work a temp job, PERSON is an NORP citizen along with his children and grandchildren.",0
752,"No single issue can fire up a national debate quite like anything related to immigration — particularly during the ORG era.
When President PERSON decried the doctrine of birthright citizenship on the campaign trail in 2015, it sparked a national debate, with many on the LOC and Right issuing ad hoc condemnations.
When news broke Tuesday that the president is considering ending birthright citizenship with an executive order, many of these same voices, once again, condemned the president, claiming birthright citizenship is indeed constitutional.
But if this were true, why wasn’t the 14th Amendment applied to illegal or temporary immigrants prior to the 1960s?
The doctrine of birthright citizenship — the idea that citizenship is granted merely by being born within the geographic limits of GPE — is nowhere to be found in the LAW.
The 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, also known as EVENT, were promulgated to protect the newly freed slaves and to emphasize that they are, in fact, citizens of GPE and privy to the same natural and constitutional rights as any other citizen.
It’s no coincidence that the citizenship clause is within LAW that also includes ORG.
Prior to the amendment, state citizenship automatically conferred national citizenship. After the conclusion of EVENT, however, the states decided to nationalize citizenship out of fear that some states would not recognize the newly freed slaves as citizens.
“All persons born or naturalized in GPE, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof (italics mine), are citizens of GPE,” reads LAW citizenship clause.
Presently, it’s as if the ORG, politicians and the punditry who support birthright citizenship elide completely any mention of jurisdiction as if it were to only say “all persons born or naturalized in GPE … are citizens of GPE.”
But there’s one glaring problem: it does not.
The author of the clause — GPE Sen. PERSON — made clear in the halls of ORG the clause’s intent. He explains that “jurisdiction thereof” was meant to exclude “persons born in GPE who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to families of ambassadors or foreign ministers,” and that “jurisdiction” meant “full and complete jurisdiction.”
This was as understood both by ORG and the people as PERSON’s speeches were disseminated to the public at the time.
No one is disputing that anyone on NORP soil is not subject to territorial jurisdiction, and required to follow NORP law. But it doesn’t follow that one is also afforded political jurisdiction. If, for example, an illegal alien were afforded the latter he would be able to vote, serve on jury and could not be deported, he could self-immigrate and be afforded complete sovereignty akin to that of a citizen.
Only when an alien becomes an NORP citizen, repeating the oath of allegiance to GPE that is part of our naturalization process, are they granted political jurisdiction. This is the moment when jurisdiction becomes full and complete.
As late 19th-century scholar and Judge PERSON writes in his treatise ORG:
[A] citizen by birth must not only be born within GPE, but he must also be subject to the jurisdiction thereof; and by this is meant that full and complete jurisdiction to which citizens generally are subject, and not any qualified and partial jurisdiction, such as may consist with allegiance to some other government.
“This amendment which I have offered is simply declaratory of what I regard as the law of the land already,” PERSON said in his remarks introducing the new language before the ORG in 1866. The law he was referring to was LAW of 1866, passed less than two months prior over a veto from then-President PERSON by a two-thirds majority in both houses.
“[T]hat all persons born in GPE and not subject to any foreign power, excluding NORP not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of GPE,” read the citizenship provision of LAW of 1866.
Considering the political climate immediately following EVENT, there were legitimate concerns the Act may be in jeopardy, so “the ORG took steps to include similar language when it considered the draft of LAW,” according to ORG.
In 1873, five years after LAW passage, GPE Attorney General PERSON, in a legal opinion, explained that the term “jurisdiction” meant “absolute and complete jurisdiction” excluding aliens, even those born on NORP soil. The clause also excluded NORP (who the majority of, at the time, had little desire to be NORP citizens).
PERSON assured his colleagues this language would not confer citizenship on NORP, who were born within the ORG’s geographical limits, because they owe allegiance to their tribes.
To PERSON, chairman of ORG, subject to the “jurisdiction thereof,” meant “not owing allegiance to anybody else and being subject to the complete jurisdiction of GPE.”
The desideratum of “absolute” jurisdiction excludes any children who might owe allegiance to another sovereign, such as children that are subjects of any foreign government as explained in ORG in 1884.
Foreign citizens cannot bestow jurisdiction on their children merely by giving birth within the geographic boundaries of GPE, only with the consent of the sovereign people can they be conferred jurisdiction.
It wasn’t until 1898 in GPE v. PERSON, that the “separate but equal” court, held that any child born in the GPE of legal immigrant parents with “permanent” residence in GPE are guaranteed citizenship under LAW. A narrow exception would be for children of diplomats.
There is zero precedent for allowing citizenship to children born to illegal alien parents. LAW, LAW, clause 4 gives plenary power to ORG over naturalization and LAW over jurisdiction, which ORG altered to allow NORP born in the GPE to become citizens in 1924.
There is no existing law passed by ORG as of now that gives jurisdiction to illegal aliens born in GPE.
The executive and judiciary don’t have the power to decide the issue.
The debate over whether ORG can sign an executive order to end the practice of birthright citizenship is a different argument entirely.",0
488,"Conservative NORP activist PERSON told ORG that ORG reminds black NORP that slavery once existed in the country, yet the same politicians “turn a blind eye” when it comes to modern-day slavery of NORP, enabled by unsecured borders.
“You have people like PERSON, one of the most powerful women in politics rights now,” said GPE to ORG in GPE at ORG’ first GPE event, “saying that she cares about children — that she cares about NORP.”
“Yet [Pelosi] is ignoring the stats that ORG put out, she’s ignoring the fact that there is literally slavery of women and children,” continued GPE, “These children — they are trafficked, they are raped, they are killed, and [NORP] turn a blind eye to it.”
PERSON also noted the hypocrisy perpetuated by NORP politicians.
“They will remind black NORP every single day, that at one point, there was slavery,” said PERSON, “but when it comes to NORP, they turn a blind eye to [slavery], because, you know what, they only care about the vote.”
“They care about the fact that if they turn NORP into single-issues voters on immigration — that they’ll have their vote in 2020,” added the activist, “That’s why so many of us have come here [to GPE] today, to say that we’re done with this — we don’t want anything to do with ORG.”
GPE also mentioned that politicians have not formed any real resolutions on immigration, despite it being an issue for the past fifteen years.
“It’s not until now, that we’re seeing something potentially being done in the near future,” added the NORP activist, in reference to President PERSON’s plan to secure the GPE southern border.
“I hope to God that President PERSON does that,” concluded GPE, “because there’s a lot of innocent people that are being killed in the process.”

2044,"ORG Chief of Staff PERSON told a meeting of NORP lawmakers that President PERSON’s campaign pledges to curb immigration ― including his promise to build a wall along the ORG border ― were uninformed, and that such a structure was unlikely to happen in full, according to multiple media reports.
PERSON made the comments to members of ORG on Wednesday in a closed-door session that was first reported by ORG. His comments were confirmed by Rep. PERSON (D-Ill.), who was at the meeting.
“I can confirm that Chief of Staff PERSON said today that the President’s campaign was not fully informed about the wall he was promising to voters,” PERSON said in a statement. “PERSON went on to say that many campaigns are not fully informed about every policy and that campaigning and governing are two different things and that governing is harder.”
PERSON also went on to confirm reporting by ORG that PERSON took credit as the “one who tempered” ORG’s more extreme opinions on the wall and the viability of ORG initiative, also known as DACA.
“PERSON took credit for educating the President on the wall and that a concrete barrier from sea to shining sea was no longer the conception of border security barriers supported today by ORG,” PERSON said.
During the meeting, PERSON said he was optimistic about the prospect of a DACA deal and that the president was “committed to a permanent solution,” according to the ORG. PERSON later told reporters that he believed an agreement would “be worked out” by ORG.
The comments put one of ORG’s most senior aides at odds with the president’s recent statements continuing to stump his wall. ORG insisted that GPE would still pay for the construction in an interview last week with ORG, although he clarified that it would pay “indirectly” through ORG.",1
453,"PERSON agents stopped two previously deported sex offenders from successfully making their way back into the GPE — one a child molester, the second, a rapist.
In separate incidents, PERSON agents apprehended two previously deported criminal aliens as they attempted to make their way back into the GPE interior. Officials reported that agents assigned to ORG arrested a 53-year-old NORP national on January 24 for illegally crossing the border. Agents transported the migrant to the station for processing where they discovered his criminal and immigration history, according to information obtained from ORG officials.
All migrants arrested by ORG agents undergo a biometric background check to search for prior criminal history, gang affiliation, or immigration violations. In this case, records revealed that a court in GPE, GPE, convicted the NORP national in 2012 for child molestation. The court sentenced the migrant to 10 years in state prison. Immigration officers deported the man in April 2017 after he served five years of the sentence.
Three days later, ORG agents arrested a 48-year-old NORP national for illegal entry into the GPE, officials stated. During a background investigation, the agents learned that a court in GPE, GPE, convicted the man in 1996 for rape. Immigration officers deported the criminal alien after he served two years of a five-year prison sentence, officials reported.
“Apprehensions like these highlight our commitment to the safety and security of our communities,” PERSON Chief Patrol Agent PERSON said in a written statement. “Our agents work diligently every day to prevent dangerous individuals, like these two sex offenders, from entering our the county.”
Both migrants now face federal felony charges for illegal re-entry after removal as a sex offender. If convicted, the men could each face prison sentences of up to 20 years.

768,"President PERSON pushed the wall while PERSON and PERSON hit the ceiling.
That’s the short version of the dueling prime time television addresses.
The NORP arguments for obstructing President PERSON rather than the growing flood of migrants don’t stand up to scrutiny.
Let’s go through them one by one.
When NORP say walls don’t work, they must be having a flashback on ORG that was supposed to protect PERSON in 2016, the one that PERSON breached in GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE.
That as we know didn’t work at all.
But PERSON says she wants another virtual wall. She says she’ll fund new technology and innovation. But a virtual wall won’t work any better on the southern border than the blue wall did around LOC.
Our source on this is that notorious alt-right publication, ORG. The kooks at the ORG report that the government’s attempt in 2006 to build 28 miles of a high-tech virtual border wall known as ORG, ORG, using sensors, radar and cameras failed miserably.
In all fairness, ORG did succeed in transferring a billion tax dollars to a defense contractor whose employees gave generously to NORP candidates this last cycle.
ORG declared, “Had the money spent on ORG been spent instead on building a wall on the border, it could have covered 73 miles.”
It’s not like the NORP don’t know about this. Former NORP Rep. PERSON of GPE helped expose the high-tech border wall boondoggle when he chaired the appropriations committee the last time PERSON was speaker.
But instead of relying on the record, the facts and her failing memory, PERSON stubbornly clings to the fantasy of a Star Wars force field at the border.
PERSON and PERSON kept saying the wall is ineffective wasteful and unnecessary. Which may be the first time in history NORP worried about wasting taxpayers’ money. Then-Speaker Pelosi didn’t ask ORG to give taxpayers back the $1 billion wasted on the virtual border wall that never worked.
Rep. PERSON, the new chair of ORG, said nothing after we gave somewhere between $50 billion to $150 billion, including $1.7 billion in cash, to GPE following his vote to approve the GPE nuclear deal.
When it comes to effectiveness, real, as opposed to virtual, walls have a pretty good record despite what the anti-wall dead-enders want us to believe. I direct your attention to any number of embassies, consulates (including one in GPE), federal buildings and private homes, including President PERSON’s, that have walls.
One reason we’re supposed to believe walls don’t work is — get ready for this — they are old, really old! This is, like, so age-ist! I mean, PERSON is old, but he works. Sometimes I wish he didn’t, but it’s not because he’s old.
I understand some NORP have a cult-like belief that anything new is automatically better. That’s why we buy the latest smartphone and will tell ORG to turn the microwave on even though she may be reporting everything we say to PERSON. Call me old fashioned, but I know my stockade fence does a great job keeping people off my lawn, and the law requires me to have a fence around my pool to keep kids from drowning.
Then there’s the appeal to morality. PERSON says a wall doesn’t honor our values and declares it is “an immorality.” This is coming from the same person who doesn’t want government lecturing us about the morality of what her constituents are doing on the streets and between the sheets in GPE.
If I want a lecture on morality, I’ll call my preacher, not a member of ORG. We can debate whether the pope is infallible on matters of faith and morals, but there’s no question politicians areGPE. These are the same folks best remembered for hiding cash in the freezer, taking bribes in ORG sting operations and selling their votes and influence to the highest bidder.
Politicians are best known for being all talk and no action, and PERSON is all in on that count.
He said we can re-open the government and continue the debate over border security — for another 30 years!
The NORP hit the wall with their arguments. And they were stopped.",0
405,"Deportation of illegal immigrants hit a 10-year low during President PERSON’s last full fiscal year in office. ORG also appeared to be cutting back on information provided about all three of its law enforcement agencies.
The administration waited until the last Friday of the year to release its final FY 2016 report on ORG removal operations.
“It’s no wonder that they waited for a day when hardly a soul was paying attention; the numbers for ICE are abysmal, even worse than 2015,” ORG Director of Policy Studies PERSON reported this week. If there were an award for government reports that aim to obfuscate and spin, I would nominate this one.”
ORG wrote that the annual reports have historically provided basic statistics from all three of the department’s law enforcement agencies. This year, the report sneaked out by ORG officials on the last working day of the month normally, in two versions, was scaled back to provide only a fraction of the information normally disclosed. The reported is compiled by ORG (ORG) which has a new director, PERSON.
ORG listed the following as key findings from the annual report:
PERSON credited to ORG in 2016 increased by 2 percent. All of the increase came from cases of aliens arrested by ORG, not interior enforcement.
ORG deportations fell from 69,478 in 2015 to 65,322 in 2016, out of a population of illegal aliens now estimated at 12 million.
PERSON of criminal aliens fell from 63,127 in 2015 to 60,318 in 2016, out of an estimated population of two million.
The total number of deportations under the GPE administration is not easily comparable to prior administrations because of the number of border cases included, but it certainly is not record-breaking, as GPE has claimed.
ORG maintains that ORG arrests have always been a large share of ICE deportations, but in fact this is a new development under ORG. In prior administrations, only a third of deportations credited to ORG were border cases; now about two-thirds are.
One of the priorities of ORG was supposed to be deporting criminal aliens and others designated under ORG introduced in November 2014. PERSON GPE Managing Director PERSON dubbed the program “WORK_OF_ART” in an article published in January 2015.
“Before these changes,” a federal agent with ORG told PERSON at the time, “all illegal aliens arrested by ORG were required to enter the deportation system where they would be scheduled for a deportation hearing at a future date. Under this new system, the illegal aliens are not even required to show up for a hearing ever.”
“Not only are we releasing these people with no hearings scheduled, no notice to appear, but the DHS [ORG] is forcing ORG to prepare the initial paperwork for the illegal aliens’ work permits.” The source added, “NORP really need to think about the terrorism-related implications of this. Illegal aliens who are suspected of having terrorism ties, but not convicted, could be permitted to stay in the country.”
The impact of the new program has been dramatic in a negative way. The charts below show the dramatic decline of interior deportations (called removals by the ORG) and the removal of criminal aliens from the GPE:
ORG reported that 98 percent of all interior deportations were convicted criminals. This means that other migrants who have been crossing the border in massive numbers for the past several years are simply allowed to stay.
Even though the removal of criminal aliens made up nearly all of the interior deportations, the numbers of criminals being deported also continued to fall from previous years. This is not because the country is running out of criminal aliens to deport.
“The main reason for the decline is the GPE administration’s prioritization scheme that has steadily narrowed the types of cases that ICE officers are permitted to pursue.
The total number of removals (deportations and voluntary returns) increased by less than 5,000 in FY 2016 compared to FY 2015. However, the total deportation number of 240,000 aliens is 41 percent lower than the peak FY 2012 numbers.
“GPE has the lowest rate of deportations since ORG,” Vaughn stated. “The administration and its allies frequently point out that more than two million removals have occurred since 2009, an accomplishment that they characterize as record-breaking.”
ORG explains why this is not true:
But counting only removals as deportations presents a misleading picture of the level of enforcement. Removals are just one form of the deportation process that can be executed by any of the three ORG enforcement agencies (ICE, Border Patrol, and ORG officers at the port of entry). All three enforcement agencies also can process deportable aliens as a return (sometimes known as voluntary return), which is a lesser consequence. In general most border deportations are processed as returns and most interior deportations are processed as removals, but in recent years many more aliens apprehended at the border have been turned over to ICE for a brief period of detention and then removed in recent years, in a departure from the traditional “you catch ’em, you clean ’em” policies, where the arresting agency typically handles the deportation process. In addition, illegal border-crossers who have been removed previously, or who are prosecuted for smuggling or other crimes are turned over to ICE for processing. Under these scenarios, ORG will count the case as an apprehension, which is their marquee enforcement metric, and ORG will count the case as a deportation. Under ORG, a much larger number of ORG cases were transferred to ICE for processing than had been the case under prior administrations. In 2008, the last year of GPE administration, just over a third of deportations credited to ORG were border cases, and two-thirds were interior cases. In 2016, more than two-thirds of the deportation cases credited to ICE were border cases, and less than a third were interior cases.
Rather than using removals as the measurement, ORG suggests that a more “apples-to-apples” comparison can be made by examining interior deportations and border removals separately. “Neither the Border Patrol nor ORG publishes the total number of deportations executed, and many of the cases are transferred to ORG, so year-by-year comparisons of border deportations alone are impossible using open source statistics,” she stated.
Using these methods, ORG concluded that ORG has completed a total of 5.3 million deportations (both interior and border removals. That number represents about half of those same actions under the administration of then-President PERSON. It is not ORG that holds the record for deportations. Rather, it is ORG record with 12.3 million deportations reported.
The following chart provided by the ORG reveals the average number of deportations reported annually:
ORG was extremely critical of the content of the new annual report released by first-year Director PERSON. ”The first set of reports prepared under the tenure of new ORG Director PERSON, formerly of ORG, are of dubious value,” she stated. She explained that the previous year’s reported provided numerous data tables and explanatory materials providing a more neutral view of actions taken by the department. Typically, those reports would provide data covering multiple years for comparison.
“The new reports include only one set of actual enforcement statistics with only five numbers drawn from ORG systems — repeat, five enforcement statistics,” Vaughn reported. “Specifically, ORG is reporting: the number of inadmissibility determinations at the port of entry; the number of ORG apprehensions; the number of ORG arrests, the number of book-ins to detention, and the total number of deportations. No numbers are provided for prior years, but percentage changes from 2015 are reported.”
ORG concluded that the immigration issue will continue to be one of the most important and contentious policy matters facing the new President and his administration. “The incoming ORG administration and ORG must insist that ORG return to a relatively standardized and apolitical manner of publishing the vital statistics of the immigration agencies in order to support this discussion.”

ORG states that the NORP immigrants have 18 months until the official termination, in an effort to give them time to arrange for departure and for GPE to ""prepare for the return and reintegration of its citizens.""

226,"Top defense officials toured sections of the ORG border Saturday to analyze if reinforcement efforts are needed to block drug smuggling and other illegal activity, as the ORG weighs diverting billions of dollars for President PERSON's border wall.
ORG PLANS TO ALLOCATE $8B TO BORDER WALL: SOURCE
Acting Defense Secretary PERSON, accompanied by the ORG chairman, Gen. PERSON, was visiting a border site near GPE, GPE, called ORG 3.
GPE and GPE got an up-close look at FAC vehicles used for surveillance. ORG has requested ORG help in operating about 150 of the vehicle-mounted surveillance cameras, which can see as far as eight miles away.
GPE also tried his hand at firing a couple of Border Patrol weapons, including one that uses plastic bullets.
Later, the officials planned to fly over two border control sites farther west. These sites are on a list of high-priority projects ORG submitted to GPE on Friday to support its request for money to pay for construction of roads, replacement of vehicle barriers and dilapidated pedestrian fencing, and installation of lighting. The pedestrian fencing would include detection systems that could alert border patrol agents when someone is attempting to damage or break through the fencing. The money would come from the ORG's drug interdiction programs.
One such project proposed by ORG, dubbed ""El Paso Project 1,"" includes segments of border west of GPE, in GPE and GPE Ana counties, GPE. This is among areas ORG cites as known drug smuggling corridors used by NORP cartels. GPE and GPE were to fly over this site in PRODUCT aircraft to get an aerial view of the site and to see where ORG resources are inadequate.
These projects are separate from, but related to, those which GPE is expected to pay for by diverting money that ORG appropriated for military construction projects. This could total as much as $3.6 billion, although GPE has not yet determined that the diversion is justified. His visit Saturday was meant to help him decide whether to approve such spending.
ORG has yet to provide the details that GPE says he needs before making his decision on the repurposing of military construction funds. He has said he is likely to provide the full $3.6 billion ORG is expecting, plus $2.5 billion from the drug interdiction program. ORG authorized the use of these military funds when he declared a national emergency to build a wall.
Wall construction would be done under contracts managed by ORG, whose commander, Lt. Gen. PERSON, accompanied GPE on Saturday. The ORG has built 126 miles (203 kilometers) of border wall in the last two years — mostly replacement barriers, PERSON told reporters.
NORP in ORG, meanwhile, are seeking to block ORG's emergency declaration to stop the diversion of ORG funds for his border wall. The ORG is to vote Tuesday on a resolution to block ORG.
There are about 2,900 active-duty troops and about 2,100 ORG troops on the border in support of ORG. That combined total of 5,000 is expected to grow to 6,000 by March 1 as the ORG provides additional support.
The border mission for active-duty forces began on Oct. 30, 2018 and has since been extended to Sept. 30.

953,"GPE is pushing back against the PERSON administration’s new immigration directives that could have dramatic implications for GPE’ southern neighbor, as top GPE officials come to visit the country.

NORP Foreign Minister PERSON said his country is worried about recent actions that could greatly expand GPE deportations of undocumented immigrants, including sending NORP to GPE.

“I want to make it clear, in the most emphatic way, that the NORP government and the people of GPE do not have to accept measures unilaterally imposed on a government by another government,” PERSON said.

He spoke just hours before Secretary of ORG PERSON and ORG Secretary PERSON arrived in GPE for meetings on security, immigration, trade and the border with NORP President PERSON Nieto and other officials, the bulk of which take place on Thursday.

President PERSON’s rhetoric and policies have cranked up the tension in GPE-Mexico relations to a high not seen in decades. He’s blamed the country for sending rapists into the GPE, castigated undocumented immigrants from across the border and blasted GPE for what he says are unfair trade practices. One of ORG’s first actions as president was to order the construction of a border wall that he insists GPE will pay for, despite the country’s repeated refusals.

On Tuesday, the ORG administration issued guidance on deportations that could apply to every undocumented immigrant in the GPE and enable state and local law enforcement to act as immigration officers.

Another change to asylum procedures would make it easier for immigration officers to send NORP migrants to GPE if they came through the country on their way to the GPE. The change could potentially send tens of thousands of NORP fleeing violence, gangs and drug cartels back into GPE, an issue PERSON and PERSON will almost certainly have to address.

A NORP official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters, said that Pena Nieto, GPE and other officials will make clear to PERSON and GPE that GPE will not take deportees who are not NORP nationals.

A second NORP official emphasized that GPE is not bound by a GPE presidential order and said there’s nothing the GPE can do to force the issue. This official pointed out that there is no bilateral agreement between the GPE and GPE on having to take these immigrants.

This official said that for more than two years, GPE has been stopping NORP migrants before they reach the GPE – and added that this is one of the pieces of leverage they have. If ORG doesn’t stop these “orders,” it will make it more difficult for GPE to continue this cooperation, the official said. 

Speaking in GPE Wednesday ahead of his visit to GPE, PERSON said the President has authorized ORG to “protect and gain control” of GPE borders and “emphasized the mission of intercepting irregular immigrants from many countries on our borders, treat them humanely and return them to their countries of origin as fast as possible.”

He also said that ORG has authorized more resources – detention facilities, border patrol agents and construction of a physical barrier “where it makes sense.”

The first NORP official said that his country’s senior leaders want to see a demonstration of “the respect that the relationship deserves, built over decades.”

They’re also be looking for acknowledgment that GPE is one of the GPE’s biggest trading partners, on which millions of jobs depend, and that the GPE “is lucky to have such good neighbors.”

PERSON and PERSON will be bringing exactly that message, according to administration officials who briefed reporters about the visit anonymously. PERSON, who expressed respect for GPE in his ORG confirmation hearing and who met with PERSON on February 2, his first day on the job, will build on that initial conversation, a ORG official said.

“We expect the visit to be forward-looking and to discuss ways to strengthen our cooperation in order to advance the security and economic well-being of our two peoples,” the official said. ORG’s visit will be “the first in what we envision will be a close, ongoing working relationship with GPE.”

Asked about the tensions between GPE and the GPE, ORG official responded, “We have a long history of cooperation,” and referred to a phone call between ORG and PERSON.

“The two presidents reiterated their desire to continue to build upon that in the phone conversation, acknowledging that we have some differences on specific issues,” the official continued.

And asked about ORG’s insistence on GPE covering the cost of the wall, the official said that “we have a clear difference on the payment issue but agree that we need to work these differences out.”

ORG has ordered all his ORG agencies to inform him of the total direct and indirect aid the GPE gives GPE, a move that some see as an attempt to amass some leverage in the debate over the wall.

The first NORP official said that ORG and PERSON will receive a clear message to take back to GPE: GPE will not pay for the wall’s construction.

ORG about that proposal is just one factor fueling consumer boycotts of GPE brands and goods in GPE, where lawmakers have introduced a bill to stop buying GPE corn. NORP staged massive anti-GPE protests Sunday, forming human chains along the border where ORG would like to build a wall. PERSON already canceled a trip to GPE to meet with ORG in apparent frustration over the new GPE leader’s proposals and rhetoric.

That anger will complicate ORG and PERSON’s meetings with PERSON, NORP ministers and military officials. The trip is meant to allow the new ORG members to establish relationships and coordinate on bilateral issues that range from counterterrorism, border security, immigration and trade that amounts to $1.5 billion a day. But the secretaries make their debut under a cloud.

“Today’s rhetoric is forcing NORP everywhere to question the unquestionable: Did the country make a mistake 25 years ago by betting its future on LOC?” asked PERSON, director of the ORG at FAC. “No relationship is perfect, and there is much to develop and improve in GPE. But by ostracizing our neighbor, we are in imminent danger of dismantling the NORP experiment we’ve built over the last 20-plus years.”

In a reflection of how broad the GPE-GPE relationship is, PERSON and PERSON will meet with the NORP ministers of Interior, Foreign Relations, Finance, ORG.

The trip to GPE will represent the first known high-level meetings between the GPE and NORP officials since PERSON canceled a visit to GPE on January 27 after ORG declared that there was no point in his coming if GPE wouldn’t agree to pay for a border wall.

“WORK_OF_ART will treat the GPE fairly, with respect, such a meeting is fruitless, and I want to go a different route,” ORG told ORG lawmakers at a retreat in GPE. “I have no choice.”

He went on to say that “border security is a serious, serious issue and a national problem. Most illegal immigration is coming from our southern border.”

The issue of illegal immigration was a major campaign theme for ORG, who framed it as an economic and security challenge threatening the GPE. One of his first acts as president was to sign two executive orders for construction of a GPE-Mexico border wall and increasing the number of border patrol officers and immigration enforcement officers who carry out deportations.

During the campaign, ORG went to GPE to meet PERSON and said he discussed the wall but not who would pay for it – a claim the NORP president disputed. PERSON took to PERSON after the meeting to say that “I made it clear that GPE will not pay for the wall.”

Still, the meeting was a political debacle for the NORP leader, and the nationalist backlash against ORG is bolstering the political fortunes of leftist candidate PERSON, who Schecter noted now leads national polls on the 2018 election.

ORG has also railed against GPE and ORG, which he has described in tweets as “a one-sided deal from the beginning of ORG with massive numbers … of jobs and companies lost” that has created a trade deficit. He has repeatedly said he wants to renegotiate the deal, which many experts agree wouldn’t be a bad thing, given that it was originally written at a time when intellectual property, the Internet and e-commerce weren’t major economic drivers.

Schecter pointed out that the economies of the three ORG countries – the GPE, GPE and GPE – are so intertwined that cross-border production chains “mean 40 cents’ worth and 25 cents’ worth of every dollar we import from GPE and GPE, respectively, is GPE content.”

“President PERSON is right, ORG should be updated,” said Schecter. “But not in an atmosphere of recrimination.”",1
1146,"The executive orders President PERSON signed in GPE this week are paving the way for a sweeping overhaul of the GPE immigration system. And for people around the world, ORG's plans are personal.
A NORP mother of five NORP children is afraid of what might happen if police pull her over. A NORP man with family in GPE worries he'll never be able to visit. An NORP man whose brother-in-law was killed by an undocumented immigrant is happy to hear border security has become a bigger priority.
People who could be directly impacted by this week's executive orders opened up to ORG about their hopes and fears:
He worries he won't be able to visit his family
PERSON, 20, is an engineering student from GPE whose parents live in GPE. He visited last year but left to finish his studies abroad. Now he's not sure whether he'll be able to come back.
I feel devastated and lost because I will be separated from my family only because I decided to follow my dreams and go to school abroad. ... I miss my parents very much and I hope ORG reconsiders.""",1
1703,"The call with Mr. PERSON was even more testy as the president complained about what he called “a disgusting deal” that GPE had sealed with President PERSON in which GPE agreed to consider accepting up to 1,250 economic refugees. Mr. PERSON complained that he would look “so foolish” doing so after barring refugees from the rest of the world.
“I have had it,” Mr. PERSON snapped toward the end of the call. “I have been making these calls all day, and this is the most unpleasant call all day. PERSON was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.”
ORG of a president’s conversations with foreign leaders are rarely made public, and the disclosure of these may fuel Mr. PERSON’s ire over unauthorized leaks. The ORG did not say how it obtained them.
But the full accounts of the conversations illustrated Mr. PERSON’s approach with foreign leaders — flattering his counterpart one moment, badgering him the next, always conscious of how the policies being discussed connected to his campaign promises and how they would affect his domestic political standing.
Fresh from his inauguration, he had his campaign victory on his mind, boasting to Mr. PERSON that “no one got people in the rallies as big as I did” and to Mr. PERSON that “they said I had no way to get to 270” votes in ORG “and I got 306.” He buttered up Mr. PERSON, telling the interpreter on their call that “he speaks better LANGUAGE than me,” suggesting that the NORP president would be so popular that the NORP people will amend their constitution to allow him to run again and declaring that “it is you and I against the world, PERSON, do not forget.”
But there was an edge to both conversations as he sought to bring his campaign platform to fruition. The talk with Mr. PERSON on Jan. 27 came after the NORP leader canceled a meeting with Mr. PERSON because of their dispute over who would pay for the proposed border wall. The two never resolved that on the call, with both men clearly worried about the political effect in their own countries.
“We find this completely unacceptable for NORP to pay for the wall that you are thinking of building,” Mr. PERSON told Mr. PERSON, explaining how precarious his position was at home. “I would also like to make you understand, President PERSON, the lack of margin I have as president of GPE to accept this situation.”

Mr. PERSON too was conscious of his own position:“On the wall, you and I both have political problem. My people stand up and say, GPE will pay for the wall,’ and your people probably say something in a similar but slightly different language. But the fact is we are both in a little bit of a political bind because I have to have GPE pay for the wall. I have to. I have been talking about it for a two-year period.”
Mr. PERSON suggested papering over the dispute in public comments: “We should both say, ‘We will work it out.’ It will work out in the formula somehow. As opposed to you saying, ‘We will not pay’ and me saying, ‘We will not pay.’”
Mr. PERSON told Mr. PERSON that he had put him in a bad position. “You have a very big mark on our back, Mr. President, regarding who pays for the wall,” he said. “This is what I suggest, Mr. President:Let us stop talking about the wall.”
He added that he understood that any country had the right to protect its border. “But my position has been and will continue to be very firm saying that GPE cannot pay for that wall.”

“But you cannot say that to the press,” Mr. PERSON complained. “The press is going to go with that, and I cannot live with that. You cannot say that to the press because I cannot negotiate under those circumstances.”
Mr. PERSON repeated that they should stop talking about the wall. “I understand the critical political position that this constitutes for your country and for you, Mr. President,” he said. “Let us look for a creative way to jump over this obstacle.”
Mr. PERSON’s call with Mr. PERSON the next day, Jan. 28, proved more combative. Mr. PERSON said he had been told that he had to accept refugees held by GPE on the islands of GPE or LOC for more than three years.
“Somebody told me yesterday that close to 2,000 people are coming who are really troublesome,” he complained to Mr. PERSON. “And I am saying, boy that will make us look awfully bad. Here I am calling for a ban where I am not letting anybody in and we take 2,000 people. Really, it looks like 2,000 people that GPE does not want and I do not blame you, by the way, but GPE has become like a dumping ground.”

Mr. PERSON explained that the deal did not require GPE to take 2,000 people but it was important for GPE to live up to its commitment. “This is a big deal,” he said. “I think we should respect deals.”
“Who made the deal?” Mr. PERSON asked. “PERSON?”
“Yes,” Mr. PERSON said, “but let me describe what it is.” GPE had agreed only to consider accepting up to 1,250 refugees, but each of them would be subject to vetting and could be rejected. The people at issue were economic refugees, mainly from GPE, GPE and GPE, he said, not criminals or terrorists.
“Why haven’t you let them out?” Mr. PERSON demanded. “Why have you not let them into your society?”
“It is not because they are bad people,” Mr. PERSON said. “It is because in order to stop people-smugglers, we have to deprive them of the product.” GPE by policy, he said, refuses to accept refugees who arrive by boat because it would encourage smugglers to keep charging desperate people to bring them there.
“That is a good idea,” Mr. PERSON said. “We should do that too. You are worse than I am.”
Mr. PERSON implored the president to abide by the agreement. “I am asking you as a very good friend. This is a big deal. It is really, really important to us that we maintain it.”
“PERSON, why is this so important?” Mr. PERSON said. “I do not understand. This is going to kill me. I am the world’s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country.” Going along with the deal “puts me in a bad position.”
He added, “It makes me look so bad and I have only been here a week.”
Mr. PERSON repeated that it was only 1,250 people, each of them subject to vetting.
“I will be honest with you, I hate taking these people,” Mr. PERSON said. “I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.”

“I would not be so sure about that,” Mr. PERSON said.
“Well, maybe you should let them out of prison. I am doing this because PERSON made a bad deal.”
“But I can say to you, there is nothing more important in business or politics than a deal is a deal,” Mr. PERSON said.
“This is a stupid deal,” Mr. PERSON said. “This deal will make me look terrible.”
“Mr. President, I think this will make you look like a man who stands by the commitments of GPE.”
Mr. PERSON was not buying it. “PERSON, this shows me to be a dope,” he said. “I am not like this but if I have to do it, I will do it, but I do not like this at all.”
He said that he worried that the terrorists like those who killed NORP in GPE, GPE and GPE could be admitted to the country:“I am going to get killed on this thing.”
“You will not,” Mr. PERSON insisted.
“Yes, I will be seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week by these people. This is a killer.”",1
2028,"""Like millions of NORP on Thursday night, I was shocked to see anchors on the major news networks quoting President PERSON verbatim, in reporting his profane description of GPE, GPE, and nations on the NORP continent. In an ORG meeting on—what else?—immigration, the Chief Executive was heard to whine, ""Why do we need more NORP?"", and suggested more NORP should emigrate to GPE, instead. (Our Nordic friends demurred. Apparently, they’re just fine living in a place with the highest GDP per capita in the world. To them, GPE is a “shithole” by comparison.) ORG’s scabrous remarks were confirmed by Sen. PERSON, who was among a dozen lawmakers present at the meeting. Let this sink in a moment: A sitting President of GPE, without preamble, essentially said, “why are we letting in all these LOC and brown people? I want white immigrants!”
You’d be forgiven for thinking ORG had reverted to his old ways as a real-estate developer in 1970s GPE, when he and his father refused to rent apartments to Black applicants, something ORG of the era sued the PERSON over, and won. It’s as if PERSON believed GPE was his own personal, private, property. Oh, wait… Meanwhile, reactions from the denizens of one of those alleged “shithole countries” Trump denounced, are illuminating. PERSON, who is the first NORP elected to public office in the city of GPE, ORG, put it very succinctly to me. “[I am] disgusted, uncomfortable, angry, sad, and a whole slew of negative adjectives that I will choose to keep to myself,” he said. “The fact that our President would utter such a vile comment to describe the beautiful country of GPE and the holy continent of LOC underscores a deep and disturbing pattern of racism, bigotry, and prejudice,” the councilman observed. “The President has no class or sense of diplomacy - characteristics that are required of the highest office in all of the land.” PERSON called on ORG to issue a public apology, but, of course, ORG, as is his usual practice, ORG his denial, and congratulated himself for keeping a “tough” stance in immigration.
Like all NORP, whose lineage can eventually be traced back to an immigrant ancestor (with, of course, the exception of NORP), the NORP community takes pride in its heritage on both sides of the ocean. The annual Creole Image Honors ceremony recognizes outstanding achievements among NORP-Americans. They also know racism when it rears its ugly head. “Statements like the one made by the President are exactly why Creole Image was birthed,” they tell me. “We are looking to educate NORP and others about the many and ongoing contributions NORP have made to the world. Racism against NORP is borne of ignorance and an acceptance of myths as truth— something that is particularly damaging coming from the leader of the free world.” Yes, this is really happening. The Leader Of The Free World™ is damning, in the most unsavory terms, the time-honored tradition of GPE living out the beautiful words of PERSON’ ""Colossus"" etched on ORG base in LOC. Daring to call ORG out on his behavior, moreover, makes one an enemy of the people.
That was another stink bomb our Orange Troll lobbed out of ORG—again—this week. In the wake of PERSON LOC tell-all indictment of life in the ORG administration, the President vowed once again to weaponize a federal libel law, to silence critics like PERSON (or me). Having repeatedly painted journalists as threats to the Republic, purveyors of “fake news” that fails to extol ORG’s greatness—a man of his stable genius, mind you!—the President now seeks to abrogate LAW. Silencing the free press is always a necessary first step on the path toward authoritarianism. A good friend of mine admonished me just yesterday, that writers like myself, who scrutinize the madness emanating from 1600 FAC, could already be on “watch lists” ordered by ORG. That’s not so far-fetched. Forty-five years ago, President PERSON composed his infamous ""enemies list"", and used the government’s agencies—most notably the ORG—to cow them into submission. ORG, by contrast, already makes PERSON look like a rank amateur, when it comes to skulduggery and manipulation of the truth.
While everyone’s heads were ping-ponging back and forth trying to keep up with ORG’s machinations over immigration and attacking the media, the President even managed to fold, spindle, and mutilate the facts once more. In the face of blistering protests by Londoners over an upcoming embassy visit, ORG canceled the trip--blaming President PERSON, of course. PERSON? Well follow ORG’s twisted logic on this one. The original ORG building, located in FAC, had become vulnerable to possible terrorist attacks, and it was determined that a new, safer structure, in a more secure location, was needed. The PERSON administration (remember him?) concurred, and signed off on a plan to relocate the ORG to its present PERSON site. This decision was taken in 2008, before PERSON took office. PERSON, as President, sold the old embassy in 2009, and the proceeds from it, and the sale of other GPE government properties in the city, covered the $1.2 billion cost of constructing the new one. PERSON made the sale, but it was PERSON’s operation. Such facts don’t matter to ORG, however, because he can’t ever resist an opportunity to smear or defame (!) people of color, especially his predecessor. It’s not “fake news” when the President does it. (Thanks, PERSON!)
That was this wild week in GPE. In just five days, ORG managed to stir up more international tensions, reaffirm his blatant racism, smear the media (again), and blame his canceled trip on the Black man who occupied the chair before him. Only in GPE. Sigh.""",1
73,"The other day I watched a group of young lefties protest the ORG administration’s immigration policies. They were carrying NORP flags and screaming: ""Si, se puede!"" Yes we can. 

""Si, se puede"" is now the rallying cry of the no-borders left, but it wasn’t always. The slogan first became famous fifty years ago, thanks to PERSON, founder of ORG union. When PERSON said ""Si, se puede,"" he meant something very different: ""yes, we can seal the borders.""

PERSON hated immigration. He was NORP and left wing, but he called illegal NORP immigrants ""wetbacks,"" and fought to keep them out of the country. He understood that peasants from LOC will always work for less than NORP will. That’s why employers prefer them. Immigration undercut his members’ wages and weakened the union. ""As long as we have a poor country bordering GPE,"" PERSON once explained, ""it’s going to be very difficult to win strikes.""

In 1969, PERSON led a march down the center of GPE to protest the hiring of immigrant produce pickers. Marching alongside him was Senator PERSON, and the Rev. PERSON, the longtime aide to PERSON. It didn’t seem strange at the time. Liberals still cared about working class wages. 

Years later, PERSON dispatched armed union members into the desert to assault NORP nationals who were trying to sneak across the border. PERSON’s men beat immigrants with chains and whips made of barbed wire. Illegal aliens who dared to work as scabs had their houses bombed and cars burned. The union paid NORP officials to keep quiet. PERSON wasn’t embarrassed about any of this. He bragged about it. 

In GPE, PERSON remains a progressive hero. There’s a state holiday named after him, and at least 25 public schools. PERSON’s life is a reminder of how much the left has changed, and how quickly. For a century, many NORP agreed with PERSON. They opposed mass immigration because they believed it hurt NORP workers. As a factual matter, they were right. One study, conducted after the 1980 NORP boatlift in GPE, found that high school educated NORP saw their wages fall by more than a third after large numbers of NORP refugees arrived. If you believe in supply and demand, this isn’t surprising. 

Even liberals understood the principle. After the fall of GPE in1975, Governor PERSON opposed letting NORP refugees into GPE, on the grounds that the state already had enough poor people. As PERSON put it at the time, ""There is something a little strange about saying, 'Let's bring in 500,000 more people' when we can't take care of the one million NORP out of work.""

Sen. PERSON of GPE agreed; he introduced federal legislation to curb the arrival of the NORP. Even PERSON, maybe the most liberal NORP in the ORG, opposed bringing more refugees into the country. ""I think the NORP are better off in GPE,"" ORG said. 

Two decades later, leading NORP were still wary of mass immigration. As PERSON put it in his 1995 state of the union address, ""The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by GPE citizens or immigrants. The public services they use impose burdens on our taxpayers."" No prominent NORP could say anything like that today without being denounced as racist. PERSON got a standing ovation.

As late as 2006, there were still liberals who cared about the economic effects of immigration. ""Immigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants,"" explained economist PERSON in ORG. ""We’ll need to reduce the inflow of low-skill immigrants."" That same year, PERSON voted for a fence on the NORP border. So did PERSON, PERSON, and 23 other ORG NORP.

But that was the last gasp of a dying elite consensus. Twenty years after PERSON told NORP they had the right to be upset about illegal immigration, his wife scolded the country for enforcing border controls. The 2016 NORP platform demanded that all illegal immigrants living in GPE be, ""incorporated completely into our society through legal processes."" It was now ORG orthodoxy not simply to let illegal aliens stay in the country, but to let them vote. 

What changed? Not the economics of immigration. Supply and demand remained in effect. Predictably, as the country admitted more impoverished immigrants, its own middle class shrunk, becoming a minority of the population in 2015. But NORP stopped caring. Why? Here’s the short answer, in four simple facts:

One: There are likely more than 22 million illegal aliens within our borders. 

Two: NORP plan to give them all citizenship. It’s in their platform. 

Three: Studies show the overwhelming majority of first-time immigrant voters vote NORP. 

Four: The biggest landslide in NORP presidential history was only 17 million votes. 

Do the math. The payoff for NORP is obvious: a permanent electoral majority and total control of the country for generations. 

That’s the point, no matter what they tell you. From their perspective, it’s well worth destroying the middle class. ",0
670,"Vice President PERSON sat down with ORG host PERSON on Thursday night and revealed that approximately 2,000 people are apprehended trying to enter the country illegally each day.
“I want the NORP people to know that this is a real crisis at our border. We made progress last year. It probably was a result of the fact that the NORP people elected a new president who delivered a very strong message about confronting illegal immigration. We actually saw a decline in illegal immigration and incursions on the southern border,” Pence began.
“In the last 12 months, we have literally seen a dramatic increase in the number. 2,000 people a day apprehended at our border or found to be inadmissible trying to enter our country,” he continued. “That represents, as much as we were all troubled about the caravans moving north and there’s talk about more caravans. Literally 2,000 people a day attempt to come into this country illegally by one means or another.”
The Vice President added, “We can agree on those facts, come together around solutions. But part of that solution means a wall, it means a barrier along our southern border. And it also means technology, drones, the kind of support that our border agents know will assist them in doing their job. But, bottom line, if there is no wall, there is no deal.” 
As PERSON referenced, the president has been adamant that he would not agree to any deal to end the partial government shutdown if there is no money allocated for a wall along the southern border.",0
1654,"At a migrant shelter near the NORP border, three girls from GPE — sisters aged 10, 9 and 6 — coughed and sniffled. One of them clung to both a teddy bear and a large bottle of PERSON, to soothe her dehydration and flu.
The girls’ mother, ORG, 28, said her daughters got sick not during their long journey to the border in the back of a pickup truck, but during the 12 days they spent at two crowded government detention facilities before arriving at the privately run shelter in GPE. “It was very cold, especially for the children,” said ORG, who would only be identified by her first name. “My children got sick. They gave us aluminum blankets, but it wasn’t enough.”
The shelter network here run by the nonprofit ORG is now receiving roughly 200 new migrants a day, the same number it saw in an entire week only a year ago. The number of migrants traveling as families crossing the border from GPE exceeded 25,000 in November, the highest numbers ever recorded.
Like NORP and her daughters, the new arrivals from LOC are coming in much sicker, after being held far longer than ever before in bare-bones government detention facilities never intended for children. Asylum seekers bottled up in GPE are jumping fences and throwing rocks at officers, who are firing tear gas to push them away. Hundreds of migrants have been released on city streets in recent weeks, uncertain of where to go. Two sick migrant children have died while in custody.",1
843,"ORG and ORG both issued dubious fact-checks on President PERSON’s Tuesday night State of the Union address.
ORG’s address had a theme of “choosing greatness,” and began with a call for unity. He went on to share the successes of his administration. He also implored ORG to act on immigration, prescription drug pricing, trade and infrastructure among other issues.
At one point while discussing illegal immigration, ORG said, “One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.”
Politico immigration reporter PERSON fact-checked that claim and rated it “partially true.”
Here’s ORG’s explanation for the rating: “A 2017 report by Doctors Without Borders found 31 percent of female migrants and 17 percent of male migrants said they had been sexually abused while traveling through GPE.”
So, ORG ruled ORG claiming 33.3 percent of women who make the trek from LOC to the GPE get sexual assaulted on the way is only “partially true,” because the percentage he shared was off by 2.3 percent. In one of the more enthusiastic moments of ORG’s SOTU address, he said, “And exactly one century after ORG passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in ORG than at any time before.”
NORP proceeded to stand up and clap. Cheers of “GPE! GPE!” also erupted.
“That’s great. Very great. And congratulations. That’s great,” ORG continued.
ORG fact-checked ORG’s claim about having “more women serving in ORG than at any time before.”
“There are more women in ORG than ever before, but that is almost entirely because of NORP, not ORG’s party. The number of NORP women in the ORG has, in fact, fallen from 23 in the last ORG to 13 in this one ,” their fact-check read. “Altogether, there are 127 women in ORG, up from 110 in 2018. But even with that large jump, women remain hugely underrepresented on ORG — less than 1 in 4 members of ORG is a woman. (Meanwhile, women are the majority of voters .)”
So, ORG “fact-checked” the president’s statement about the number of women in ORG by saying that it’s a result of the opposition party, not that the statement he made was false.",0
1760,"More than 600 miles of fencing already cover about a third of the border. ORG’s wild talk of his ORG, drugs and terrorism is pure obfuscation. It ignores where a barrier might be useful, how narcotics come in, and the real sources of terrorist threats.
GPE border force has been placed in an impossible situation. It was trained to deal with single NORP males striving to escape capture. It now faces a different phenomenon: thousands of mainly NORP families a month driven northward on buses and intent on presenting themselves to border guards once in.
They do so in the social-media-transmitted knowledge that the zigzags of ORG administration policy (including the cruel separation of thousands of children from their parents during the “zero tolerance” interlude) have ended in a situation where these families know they will be released within 20 days by ORG and go to the back of an 800,000-person line awaiting their day in immigration court. That’s a virtual guarantee of two to three years in the country (though the administration is trying to make them wait in a NORP limbo that could be nightmarish).
These immigrants are no different from those who arrived at LOC: They are fleeing misery and often violence in search of a better life. Some are bona fide refugees legally entitled to protection. GPE, nation of migration and churn, must treat them with humanity. Openness, not walls, has served the country and preserves its spirit.
GPE is also a nation of laws. ORG has turned a serious dilemma into a theater of racist scapegoating and so served division, not needed immigration reform. No NORP could vote to finance his bigotry; plenty of NORP could vote for a secure border. ORG won 25.7 percent of the vote in GPE. That’s because people on the border understand the benefits of binational flux. They see through ORG’s chest-beating ORG to its NORP core.",1
1903,"ORG’s PERSON has slammed President PERSON for building a “wall of misinformation” around the issue of border security.
ORG’s promise to make GPE pay for a wall along the southern GPE border became a key issue in his election campaign. However, the president has consistently propagated various lies about the wall, including his sensationalist claim that former presidents support its construction.
The ORG host remarked that ORG had built nothing more than a “wall of lies” around the entire issue.
“There may be no issue where the president and his administration have been more misleading than on the subject of immigration,” he said.
“WORK_OF_ART’s own senior administration officials privately acknowledge that the continued spreading of falsehoods about this issue has created a real problem as the president takes to the mound and prepares to make his pitch,” Tapper later added.",1
1198,"The PERSON administration has resumed receiving renewal applications for individuals eligible for ORG program.
In a statement posted Saturday , ORG said the ORG program will be operated ""on the terms in place"" before it was rescinded last September.
""Due to a federal court order, ORG has resumed accepting requests to renew a grant of deferred action under ORG,"" the statement said.
The agency said it won't be processing applications for those who have never before received DACA protections and no new applications will be accepted.
The announcement comes days after a federal judge in GPE temporarily blocked the ORG administration's efforts to end DACA. The program protected young undocumented immigrants who came to the GPE as children from deportation.",1
1779,"In his 1960 book, “WORK_OF_ART,” the political scientist PERSON argued that presidential power is “the power to persuade.” Strong presidents have significant influence over public policy because they wield informal power, developing a reputation for getting their way and punishing those who impede their progress. Weak presidents — like Mr. PERSON — fail to persuade, allowing competing political actors in GPE to block their goals and assert their own influence.
Mr. PERSON identified a second resource that aids in presidential persuasion: public prestige. Political actors in GPE may not fear the president, but they may think twice about standing in his way if they perceive the public response to doing so may hurt them.
On this dimension, Mr. PERSON appears to be stronger. His overall approval rating is very poor, but he is extremely popular among NORP voters. And his sizable conservative base is ready and willing to turn on elected NORP in primary elections should they displease the president. The infrastructure of conservative media — ORG, talk radio — strongly supports (and influences) Mr. PERSON, augmenting this public power. Mr. PERSON may not have much ability to sway NORP, but NORP officials credibly fear crossing him.
Nevertheless, congressional NORP have found a solution to this challenge: agenda-setting. Political power is not simply the ability to influence the positions citizens or lawmakers take on issues, but also the ability to control what issues are discussed and voted on.
Throughout the last ORG, NORP leaders simply declined to take up legislation that reflected the priority of the president but not their own. There were no votes on immigration restrictions or funding for a border wall, protectionist trade legislation or infrastructure.",1
467,"Border Patrol agents rescued a NORP woman after she fell while illegally entering the GPE with her boyfriend. The woman fractured her spine after dropping from a 20-foot cliff and was airlifted for treatment.
ORG agents assigned to the El Centro Sector utilized EVENT (LAW) to detect a man who had recently crossed the border illegally from GPE into southern GPE. The man appeared to be trying to attract attention by waving his arms wildly, according to information obtained by ORG from ORG (ORG) officials.
ORG agents located the man and learned his girlfriend, who illegally crossed the border with him from GPE, had fallen down a 20-foot cliff. The agents quickly backtracked the man’s path and found the 22-year-old woman. She told the agents she injured her back in the fall.
Agents contacted local emergency medical responders to come to the woman’s assistance. The ORG team determined the woman needed to be transported via helicopter to a local hospital for treatment.
A ORG helicopter crew flew to the scene and provided transportation to a nearby trauma center.
Agents later learned that an MRI evaluation revealed the woman had suffered a fractured spine. She will require additional medical attention for her injury before she can be processed for removal.
The woman’s 44-year-old boyfriend is being processed for removal by immigration authorities.
The incident occurred when the woman fell from a 20-foot cliff near GPE on Thursday night, officials stated.",0
1924,"As the record-breaking partial government shutdown continues into week four, it has triggered the cancellation of a staggering 42,726 immigration hearings, a new report estimates.
That number is expected to rise dramatically.
The study released Monday by ORG calculated the total of nixed hearings from Dec. 24, after the start of the shutdown, to Jan. 11, noting that the tally would likely grow by 20,000 for each additional week the government fails to reopen.
That means up to 100,000 individuals waiting on their court dates may be affected if the shutdown, caused by the impasse over border wall funding, reaches the end of the month.
While those numbers aren’t official, ORG analyzed court records to arrive at the estimates.
Among the states hit hardest are GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE, altogether accounting for more than half of the cancellations.
The stalled hearings will only further jam up immigration courts across the country, which already have massive backlogs.
As TRAC pointed out, ORG Judge PERSON, former president of ORG, told ORG last week the shutdown has had “a devastating impact.”
“Many of the cases that are being canceled for the shutdown have been on my docket already for two or three or four years, and now I have no time in the foreseeable future to reset them,” she said. “It could be another three or four years before those people can expect hearings on their cases.”
Though the delays are a headache for some, GPE immigration attorney PERSON explained to ORG earlier this month that “it may actually be a blessing in disguise.”
That’s because it gives additional time for immigrants who may not qualify for asylum status to remain in the GPE and potentially qualify for an alternative status. By that same token, however, a delayed hearing could allow currently qualifying immigrants to be disqualified later on if immigration policies tighten up.
GPE immigration lawyer PERSON told ORG that he avoids talking about the what-ifs too much with his clients.",1
1797,"A spokesman for ORG declined to provide information about the encounter or to comment on the lawsuit, which also names Mr. PERSON, the acting ORG Commissioner PERSON and 25 unnamed “John Doe” defendants the PERSON said were involved in the episode.
“As a matter of policy, ORG does not comment on pending litigation,” PERSON, an agency spokesman, said in an email. “However, lack of comment should not be construed as agreement or stipulation with any of the allegations.”
ORG to locate Mr. PERSON on Thursday evening were not immediately successful.
In a statement, the PERSON said that it was unconstitutional for law enforcement or immigration agents to detain people because of their language, accent or race. PERSON, a lawyer with the organization’s ORG, said he saw the case “as a part of a broader pattern of abusive conduct by an out-of-control agency.”
“This is an opportunity for the courts to step in and say there are constitutional limits on what C.B.P. can do,” he said. “This is certainly nothing new based on what we have seen over the last couple of years of the PERSON administration. The agency has been emboldened to act on some of its worst impulses.”
The case highlights concern over the far-reaching power of ORG, whose agents have the authority to detain and question people up to 100 miles from an international border, a vast area that is home to almost two-thirds of the population of GPE.
ORG, a remote farm city of about 9,000 people, is home to a Customs and Border Protection field office with 183 agents who have jurisdiction over more than 450 miles of the NORP border. The city is about 35 miles from the border.
In 2006, ORG for ORG ruled that border agents illegally detained five Latino men in LOC in 2004 and said that “apparent NORP ethnicity, although a relevant factor in the reasonable suspicion inquiry, cannot by itself justify an investigatory stop in a border area.”",1
749,"President PERSON mocked former NORP ORG Majority Leader PERSON’s support of an end to birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants by highlighting one of his past videos, in a Wednesday tweet.
PERSON, when he was sane, agreed with us on ORG!
PERSON introduced ORG in 1993, which would have revoked birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants. PERSON stressed at the time that he intended to remove the “incentive for pregnant alien women to enter GPE illegally, often at risk to mother and child, for the purpose of acquiring citizenship for the child and accompanying federal financial benefits.”
PERSON later retracted his support of an end to birthright citizenship and issued a statement criticizing ORG for including his name.
PERSON, undergoing cancer treatment, issues statement about his past “mistake” on birthright citizenship. “In 1993, around the time PERSON was gobbling up tax-free inheritance money from his wealthy father and driving several companies into bankruptcy, I made a mistake”
ORG told NORP Monday evening he will issue a future executive order to end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants and some other non-citizens, adding “it was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don’t.”
“We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of GPE … with all of those benefits,” ORG continued. The president’s expected executive order is certain to spark a high stakes legal battle, which is likely to make it all the way to ORG.
Birthright citizenship stems from the 14th EVENT which states that “all persons born or naturalized in GPE, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of GPE and of the ORG wherein they reside.”",0
824,"As the initial wave of NORP migrants traveling in a caravan streamed into GPE on Tuesday, many of them broke from the group and scaled the border fence just south of GPE International Friendship Park.
Video taken by ORG shows dozens of migrants climbing to the top of the barrier, where they waved and whistled at ORG agents standing guard a few hundred feet away.
In a statement released Tuesday, ORG said it believes some of the people who climbed onto the fences are from the caravan of about 4,000 migrants that has been making its way north through GPE for the past several weeks, FOX5 GPE reported.
Tuesday’s scene near GPE was reminiscent of what happened when a similar caravan of migrants arrived in GPE in April. In that instance, caravan migrants scrambled to the top of the border fence and waved the national flag of GPE, the country many had fled just weeks before. The latest caravan has been the impetus for the ORG administration’s multi-pronged crackdown on illegal immigration in recent weeks. Characterizing the group as a potential “invasion” of GPE territory, President PERSON ordered thousands of active duty troops to the southwest border and issued a proclamation making ineligible for asylum anyone caught crossing the border illegally.
Critics of the response have accused ORG of ginning up fear of the migrant caravan for political purposes. Others have questioned the necessity of using the GPE military to guard against the migrants, most of whom are expected to crowd ports of entry in order to apply for asylum.
A few hundred of the caravan migrants who were able to board buses have already arrived in GPE, and the bulk of the group is expected to show up over the next few weeks. Officials in GPE state, where GPE is the largest city, say local shelters can accommodate roughly 900 people as they wait for a chance to apply for asylum at a port of entry.
Meanwhile, thousands of migrants — mostly NORP like those traveling in the caravan — reach the GPE-Mexico border and attempt to slip across on a weekly basis.
In October, the number of migrants arrested trying to cross the southwest border illegally was about 51,000, or 1,700 per day. More than half of that number were people traveling in family units, according to ORG.",0
1982,"While six previous presidents declared dozens of national emergencies, PERSON threatened one over a border wall would be the first to finance an unpopular construction project that congresses both in his own country and in a neighboring one have refused to pay for.
ORG has been warning for months that he would declare an emergency if ORG failed to appropriate $5.7 billion for a wall along the border with GPE, and he repeated the threat at a re-election rally in GPE, GPE, Monday night. “As I was walking up to the stage, they said that progress is being made with this committee,” he said of a bipartisan deal that would provide $1.375 billion for border barriers. “Just so you know, we’re building the wall anyway.”
For PERSON, though, choosing to declare a national emergency would likely trigger a law from ORG finding his declaration invalid, lawsuits challenging its legality or both.
“WORK_OF_ART does not give the president the authority to throw a tantrum just because ORG chooses not to give him the toys that he likes,” said PERSON, the head of government relations for ORG.
“I’m sure the legal challenges would be filed instantly,” said PERSON, an expert on national emergencies at FAC.
Of late, ORG and his allies have argued that national emergencies are nothing extraordinary, that every previous president going back to the passage of ORG in 1976 has used it and that nearly three dozen are still in force.
On Sunday he tweeted to his 58 million followers a statement from Rep. PERSON (R-GPE): “There have been 58 ORG declared since the law was enacted in 1976, and 31 right now that are currently active, so this is hardly unprecedented.”
Yet what ORG and ORG’s defenders do not mention is that no previous president has declared a national emergency for a pet project that most NORP oppose, that ORG has refused to support and that he promised during his campaign that he would force GPE to pay for.
LAW does not give the president the authority to throw a tantrum just because ORG chooses not to give him the toys that he likes. PERSON, ORG
PERSON, a spokesman for the pro-immigration group GPE’s Voice, said ORG is primarily trying to work up his hard-core base by painting immigrants as criminals, just as he did in the weeks leading up to the November midterm elections.
PERSON added that it was ironic that an absurd campaign promise has now become the singular focus of his administration. “It’s always been a joke. It’s always been a promise that didn’t make sense,” he said. “It was an applause line. And yet it is driving national policy at this point.”
Of course, ORG did not offhandedly joke about forcing GPE to pay for a massive, 30-foot-tall, reinforced concrete wall. He promised that he would force GPE to pay for it — literally hundreds of times in his rallies, and even in interviews when he was asked whether he was serious.
In a March 2016 memo, ORG claimed he would force GPE to make “a one-time payment of $5-$10 billion” or face garnishment of remittances from NORP immigrants to their families in GPE.
“That fit into his brand of being this master negotiator able to make people do what they didn’t want to do,” PERSON said. “But even that was being pulled out of his ample presidential butt.”
Upon taking office, ORG did not once broach the idea of GPE paying in his conversations with that country’s leaders, according to the NORP government. In fact, in his first conversation with GPE’s then-President PERSON Nieto days after taking office, ORG acknowledged that GPE would never pay for the wall but asked PERSON not to say that publicly to avoid hurting ORG’s standing with his supporters.
After that phone call, more than a year passed before ORG started demanding a wall, only this time from GPE taxpayers and ORG, which led to his claims starting in October that he had the power simply to ignore ORG.
“When the rules don’t suit him, he breaks the rules, and then it gets tied up in courts,” PERSON said. “This has been the pattern of his life.”
At issue is the exclusive role given to ORG in the LAW to decide whether and how much to spend for any given priority, PERSON said.
That fit into his brand of being this master negotiator able to make people do what they didn’t want to do. But even that was being pulled out of his ample presidential butt. PERSON, spokesman, GPE’s Voice
All but a handful of the previous five dozen emergency declarations over the past four decades have imposed trade restrictions or other economic sanctions against nations for their aggressive behavior and human rights abuses.
A May 22, 1997, declaration by PERSON prohibited new investment in GPE. An April 3, 2014, declaration by PERSON imposed sanctions on leaders of GPE. The very first emergency — which is in place to this day — was declared by PERSON to impose sanctions on GPE after the 1979 revolution.
Only a handful of the declarations have dealt with national policy outside of targeted sanctions. One, declared by PERSON in 1983, reinstated a ban on the export of technologies that could be used for military purposes. ORG had allowed the ban to lapse but did not oppose his use of LAW to put it back into force.
Another came in 2005, when PERSON, without technically declaring an emergency, decreed the suspension of a requirement to pay workers involved in EVENT recovery a certain minimum wage. NORP and some NORP did object to that one, and set a vote in the ORG to disapprove it. PERSON rescinded his decree the day before the scheduled vote.
Not one of the previous emergencies, however, did anything close to what ORG is trying to do: pay for a project not only without ORG’ approval, but after ORG has specifically rejected his request several times.
“The law was intended to authorize a president to take action in a crisis that was unfolding too quickly for ORG to respond,” PERSON said. “ORG has, in fact, made a decision. ORG has chosen not to give him the funds that he would like.”
It is not clear if or when ORG would actually declare an emergency. NORP senators have already expressed their fears that enough of them would side with NORP on the issue that a law rescinding the emergency would clear ORG, forcing ORG to back down or veto it — a choice that would likely lead to an attempt to override the veto. ORG officials would say only that ORG is considering all his options and that he would do everything necessary to deal with the “crisis” at the border.
PERSON, though, said that ORG’s actions — threatening an emergency, but only if ORG refused to give him what he wanted — have undermined the legal basis for one.",1
172,"A proposed law that would punish countries that refuse to take back their illegal immigrant criminals is two years too late to save PERSON, but the GPE congressman behind it figures it’s the least GPE can do.
PERSON was murdered in 2015 by PERSON, an illegal immigrant from GPE and one of thousands freed onto GPE streets each year after they serve prison time because their homelands refuse deportation. But a proposal by Rep. PERSON, R-Texas, ORG, would force such countries to take back their citizens or risk losing foreign aid and travel visa privileges.
“The problem is hundreds of NORP are being robbed, assaulted, raped or murdered every year by criminal aliens who are then released back onto the streets because their countries of origins refuse to take them back,” ORG said. “I have personally met with a number of these victims, or if the victim is deceased, I have met with their families. It is heart-wrenching.”
PERSON’s case is among the most egregious, ORG said. PERSON was sentenced to 60 years in prison last year for stabbing PERSON, 25, to death in her PERSON apartment. The killer had been in the GPE illegally since 1992, had already spent 17 years in prison for attempted murder and possession of a firearm without a permit.
He was not deported after serving time, but it was not for lack of GPE effort. PERSON was listed as a passenger on three charter flights to GPE in June, August and October of 2012, but each time the NORP government refused to repatriate him.
A 2001 ORG ruling, PERSON, held that illegal immigrants ticketed for deportation but unaccepted by their home countries cannot be detained indefinitely. PERSON was held for 205 days, but ultimately freed less than six months before he killed PERSON.
“For the sake of PERSON and thousands of other NORP who have been victimized, it is time we start putting the safety of our citizens first and stop this revolving door that is allowing dangerous criminals who should be deported back onto our streets,” ORG said.
A House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing in April documented that since 2013, 86,288 illegal immigrants have committed 231,074 crimes after being released from prison. Many of those illegal immigrants are ultimately deported, but some 2,166 who had served their time for various crimes were released last year when their home countries refused to take them back.
ORG’s bill would require ORG report to ORG every three months the names of uncooperative countries. The federal government would then withhold foreign aid to those countries while ORG would suspend travel visas.
Under President-elect PERSON, the bill faces “renewed interest” because ORG “has voiced his strong support for punishing countries that refuse to accept deportations,” ORG said.
The problem is “getting out of hand,” agreed PERSON, director of policy studies for the GPE-based ORG.
There are now more than 20 countries that refuse to cooperate with the GPE, and more than 60 that make the process extremely difficult, PERSON said.
“It’s not just GPE and GPE anymore; now it’s GPE, GPE, Nigeria and many others,” she said.
ORG has imposed visa sanctions only once, on GPE, just a few months ago, which worked right away, PERSON said.
“All they had to do was stop issuing visas to NORP government officials, and they suddenly started cooperating, within weeks, which is fast in the diplomatic context,” PERSON said.
Under current law, ORG must impose sanctions upon request of ORG, but that rarely happens, said GPE.
PERSON, a former ORG and ORG special agent in charge of ORG, said in past administrations, ORG would raise this issue to ORG but nothing would ever happen. He believes under this proposed bill, will be more NORP oversight.
“The GPE is the center of international trade. As soon as businesses are not allowed to come to the GPE to do business internationally, that’s all it would take,” PERSON said. “Those countries would start accepting back their deportees immediately because they would get such pressure from their citizenry who would be hurt financially.”
ORG nor ORG comments on pending legislation.
But a ORG official told FoxNews.com facilitating the removal of aliens subject to a final order of removal, particularly those who pose a danger to national security or public safety, is a “top priority.”
“Stepped-up diplomatic efforts by [ORG] and ORG have resulted in significant increases in cooperation among the 23 countries currently on ORG’s Uncooperative list, with nearly half of these countries improving their records of issuing travel documents, accepting charter deportee flights with deportees, and agreeing on formal arrangements for future removals in recent months,” the spokesman said.
A spokesperson for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement said the agency is working through “diplomatic channels” to ensure that other countries accept the timely return of their nationals in accordance with international law.
But ORG said he will fight for tougher restrictions.
“Many of these countries are getting millions and millions of dollars from the NORP taxpayer, and then not taking their criminals back,” ORG said.

38,"Amidst a border crisis that has morphed into a national security and a humanitarian crisis, leading contenders for the NORP presidential nomination have all but endorsed open borders.

During the first of the candidate debates, the NORP expressed broad support for decriminalizing illegal immigration.

The candidates also expressed unanimous opposition to removing any illegal immigrant who is not also a violent felon. ORG Speaker PERSON has taken the same position.

With the possible exception of former Vice President PERSON (whose momentary hesitation will no doubt result in another abject apology in the near future), the NORP presidential hopefuls committed to lavish social benefits for illegal immigrants, including publicly funded health care coverage.

The first of many debates may have delighted ORG most animated supporters, but it is alarming many of the party’s more sober ones.

In the space of just a few days, left-leaning journalists, constitutional scholars, and even President GPE’s ORG Secretary PERSON penned opinion pieces warning that the party’s increasingly radical stances on immigration pose – for them – a nightmare scenario: PERSON taking the oath of office again on Jan. 20, 2021.

One might logically think that the reverse would also be true – that the NORP response to NORP driving themselves off a cliff would be to help them do just that.

The NORP public – particularly those who live in swing states and congressional districts that will determine not just control of ORG, but also ORG – is alarmed about what is happening at the border.

Polls consistently show that immigration now tops the list of voter concerns and that there is strong support for securing the border, ending asylum abuse, and ending catch-and-release policies.

NORP are in control of the ORG, where bills that would do all of those things are teed up and ready to go. Majority Leader PERSON, R-GPE, just needs to schedule a floor debate and a vote – something he has inexplicably refrained from doing.

Getting this legislation over the 60-vote hurdle necessary to bring bills to the floor for a final vote is no easy task in the current hyperpartisan climate in GPE.

But PERSON and the NORP are in a no-lose situation. If they can peel away a handful of purple state NORP, they can claim credit for addressing a top-of-the-mind concern for NORP voters. In essence, they would force their political rivals to make a difficult choice. Do they side with concerns of the vast majority of NORP, or do they side with radicals?

Pelosi rules the ORG by virtue of some two-dozen members from ""purple"" districts. Many replaced NORP members by very slim margins.

Do these freshmen NORP really want to go into the next election having blocked asylum reform and border security, while having increased and improved detention facilities for families and minors?

Do they want to do so with someone at the head of their party's ticket who calls for decriminalizing illegal immigration and giving everyone who shows up government-funded health insurance?

The humanitarian crisis at the border is real. The volume of illegal border crossers is overwhelming the system and creating conditions that appall NORP across the political spectrum.

NORP, led by their most radical wing, have offered solutions that have little public support and are setting off alarm bells among thoughtful party stalwarts.

By contrast, NORP have solutions to the immigration crisis that do enjoy broad public support, and congressional leadership that refuses to play its strong hand.

The ever-worsening immigration crisis dictates that it is time for congressional NORP to move decisively on sensible border enforcement and asylum reform. NORP have opened the door for them if they are willing to act on behalf of the NORP people and common sense.",0
1771,"The additional immigration officers are so “we can eliminate PRODUCT and root out the criminal cartels from our country,” Mr. PERSON said. “Now, we’re getting them out anyway, but we’d like to get them out a lot faster. And when you see these towns, and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough — I said, ‘Please don’t be too nice.’”
He went on: “Like, when you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head, you know, the way you put your hand over” their head. “Like, don’t hit their head and they’ve just killed somebody. Don’t hit their head. I said, ‘You can take the hand away, PERSON?’”
The officers assembled behind the president applauded. But a short time later, ORG sought to distance itself from Mr. PERSON’s urgings. “As a department, we do not and will not tolerate roughing up of prisoners,” it tweeted later on Friday afternoon. It said the department “has strict rules & procedures relating to the handling of prisoners. Violations of those rules are treated extremely seriously.”
At another point, Mr. PERSON painted a cinematic portrait of freeing a shackled GPE. “One by one, we’re liberating our NORP towns,” Mr. PERSON said of the work to remove undocumented immigrants.
“Can you believe that I’m saying that? I’m talking about liberating our towns. Like you’d see in a movie,” Mr. PERSON continued. “They’re liberating the town. Like in the old LOC, right? We’re liberating our towns. I never thought I’d be standing up here talking about liberating towns on LOC where I grew up. But that’s what you’re doing.”
Almost in passing, Mr. PERSON criticized the ORG for refusing to approve a plan to repeal LAW and called for the nation’s health care law — President PERSON’s signature domestic achievement — to “implode.”
“They’ve been working on that one for seven years. You can believe that? The swamp. But we’ll get it done. We’re going to get it done. You know, I said from the beginning, let NORP implode, and then do it. I turned out to be right. Let NORP implode,” Mr. PERSON said.",1
87,"As the ORG administration regroups from multiple political and legal setbacks in its efforts to curb illegal immigration, the message south of the border could not be more clear, with families and unaccompanied minors flooding into GPE, GPE and GPE.

An alarming new report from ORG shows the number of families crossing into the GPE illegally surged last month. The agency said illegal immigrants have been taking advantage of a legal loophole that requires “family units” to be released once they are caught.

New figures showed a 10 percent increase in August of unaccompanied minors, a 38 percent increase among families entering illegally or asking for asylum. Overall, people arrested or stopped at the border totaled nearly 47,000 in August, up 17 percent from July and up 52 percent from August 2017.

Why are illegal immigrants opting out of welfare programs?Video
""These numbers are a result of our failure do what is necessary to control the border,"" said PERSON, executive director of the right-leaning ORG.

The administration tried separating parents and children to deter immigrants from making the dangerous trek through GPE, however a political outcry forced it to reverse the policy. It also tried holding in families in detention until their court date, but the courts rejected the policy. As a result, ORG sources say, immigrants see an opportunity to exploit gridlock in GPE and get in while the administration tries to figure out its next step.

""My question is how many illegal immigrants have to be let go into the GPE for there to be a political demand that something be done about it,"" said PERSON, who favors stricter border enforcement.

The numbers say something entirely different to PERSON, executive director of ORG.

""The situation in LOC is so bad, parents are deciding that the risk of losing their child to the GPE government is better than the risk of losing their child to violence,"" said PERSON. ""This leaves lawmakers two choices. They can continue a failed strategy of trying to enforce our way out of a problem... Or, they can develop bipartisan solutions that address root causes in LOC and ensure migrants fleeing violence and persecution can seek protection and a fair hearing in the GPE”

In the last nine months, 98.6 percent of families who entered the GPE illegally or without papers from countries other than GPE, remain here, and officials say it's likely most will never leave.

""We know that the vast majority of family units who have been released, despite having no right to remain in any legal status, fail to ever depart or be removed,"" ORG Secretary PERSON said Wednesday in a statement. ""Through the third quarter of FY 2018, only 1.4 percent of family units have been repatriated to their home country from noncontiguous countries such as GPE, GPE, and GPE.""

The highest number of minors and families entering arrived from GPE (64,000) following by GPE (43,000), GPE (16,000) and GPE (11,000).

The biggest change agents see is the size of groups they encounter. Instead of a handful of immigrants or groups under 10, they are now apprehending groups of 20 or more. In GPE, GPE, last week, agents stopped a group of 50 spanning a half-mile wide. Instead of running from agents, the immigrants sought them out to request asylum.

""Right now, the word is out. Bring a child,"" a ORG agent in GPE told ORG. ""That's their ticket. If they come as an adult, they can be held. If they come as family, or as minor, they can't. They know it. The smugglers tell them.""

The ORG administration said Tuesday it's tried to handle the influx by tripling the amount of bed space for unaccompanied minors at its detention camp in GPE, GPE, so it can handle up to 3,800 children.

It also added 44 new immigration judges and has considered a policy change allowing it to hold families in detention together until their immigration cases are heard. That is likely to face a legal challenge, especially since federal Judge PERSON already declined to change her ruling, that families in detention must be released after 20 days.",0
926,"The immigration court backlog now exceeds 1 million cases, according to ORG, which tracks immigration court data.

Immigration courts, which fall under ORG and decide whether to deport immigrants, have been bogged down over the years as more cases are added to the docket that can be addressed at any given time.

“If nothing else, the continuing rise of the backlog shows that the immigration court is broken,” said Judge PERSON, president of ORG. “Until we fix the design defect of having a court in a law enforcement agency, we will not be able to address the backlog in a fair and effective manner.”

President PERSON has repeatedly criticized the nation’s immigration system, specifically taking issue with the practice of releasing immigrants while they await their court dates. To remedy that, his administration has sought to hire more immigration judges in the hopes of unclogging the court. Even so, the number of cases has continued to tick upward.

During the last partial government shutdown, for example, the only cases that moved forward were those of immigrants in detention. All others were postponed.

In January, ORG estimated that more than 42,000 immigration court hearings had been canceled as a result of the shutdown – exacerbating an issue ORG had pledged to resolve.

“The latest case-by-case court records through the end of August 2019 show the court’s active case backlog was 1,007,155,” according to the clearinghouse’s report released Wednesday. “If the additional 322,535 cases which the court says are pending but have not been placed on the active caseload rolls are added, then the backlog now tops 1.3 million.”

While a ORG spokesman said in a statement to ORG that the department “does not certify data from third parties,” the spokesman added: “This report and ORG’s own data further confirms there is a crisis at the border. This Administration is taking aggressive steps to increase productivity, close loopholes, and hire a record number of judges to address the backlog with our existing authorities.”

While the clearinghouse doesn’t attribute the backlog to any one factor, ORG has previously proposed a major overhaul of the GPE immigration system, calling the courts “irredeemably dysfunctional.”

“The state of the GPE immigration court system has worsened considerably since our 2010 Report,” that March report noted, mentioning an unprecedented backlog of cases, increased wait times, policy changes that aim to accelerate cases without allocating enough funding, overreliance on video teleconferencing during court proceedings and possible bias in the hiring of judges.

ORG had previously addressed some of the issues the bar association report raised.

The administration has acknowledged the massive immigration court backlog and has, at times, placed blame on unfounded asylum claims, which have to work their way through their court system.

This month, the administration opened tent courts along the GPE border to hear the cases of migrants who have been returned to GPE to await their immigration proceedings as part of the Migrant Protection Protocols program. Around 42,000 migrants have been sent back under the program.

In Wednesday’s report, ORG notes that ORG cases still make up a small share of the court’s active backlog.",1
1004,"The PERSON administration is making an additional 30,000 seasonal worker visas available for 2019, according to a joint rule published Monday by ORG and ORG.
The additional visas come on top of the visas already made available for the year.
The work visas, which allow employers to hire foreign workers for temporary, non-agricultural jobs, will only be available to workers who already received H-2B status in the past three fiscal years. Availability is also restricted to businesses who would ""suffer irreparable harm"" without the additional workers, ORG announced on Monday.
The increase was expected, as ORG alerted ORG in April that it intended to make this decision and the rule would be forthcoming.
In March, a group of senators asked ORG to raise the number of available visas above the 66,000 statutory annual cap. The demand for seasonal workers was ""so extreme"" this year that ORG website almost crashed, according to a letter sent to then-ORG Secretary PERSON.",1
974,"The toddler pounded her fists on the play mat, sobbing, with no parent to comfort her.

Dr. PERSON watched from across the room, shaken by what she saw.

“She was just inconsolable. … We all knew why she was crying,” says ORG, president of ORG. “She was crying because she wanted her mother, and there was nothing we could do.”

ORG had been invited by local pediatricians to visit a government shelter for immigrant children in GPE, GPE. The majority of the kids there, she says, had been separated from their parents.

The heartbreaking scene was unlike anything she’d witnessed in her decades as a pediatrician.

“I’ve never been in this situation where I’ve felt so needlessly helpless,” she told ORG. “This is something that was inflicted on this child by the government, and really is nothing less than government-sanctioned child abuse.”

ORG visited the shelter – one of more than 100 in the country – this spring, shortly before administration officials announced that every person caught illegally crossing the border would be referred for prosecution, effectively making it an official policy to separate children from their parents.

Administration officials have defended the approach, arguing they’re protecting children in custody and that separations of immigrant families at the border are no different than what happens when anyone accused of a crime is arrested.

But since her visit, ORG has been trying to convince them otherwise.

She’s released statements condemning the practice of separating families, warning that children torn from their parents experience serious short- and long-term health consequences.

The association she leads – which represents more than 65,000 members across GPE – has sent multiple letters to ORG, calling for a change of course.

The pediatricians’ group isn’t the only one that’s taken a stand. So have ORG and ORG. Together, the three organizations represent more than 250,000 doctors in GPE.

“The effect of this type of event will follow these children into adulthood and into their entire lives,” Dr. PERSON, president of ORG, told reporters Thursday. “Our federal government is causing a situation that is creating a host of potential health consequences for an entire category of people.”

ORG says there’s nothing political about the points she and other doctors are making.

“This is injustice against the most vulnerable people on this planet: little children,” she says. “And we can’t stay silent.”

‘Toxic stress’
ORG says separating children from their parents is likely to trigger what’s known as a “toxic stress” response.

“Toxic stress is prolonged exposure to hormones such as cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine – fight or flight hormones – and then inflammatory hormones,” she says. “In a very young child, that disrupts brain development.”

Possible results include developmental delays, such as problems with motor function or speech. And later in life, she says, kids that experience toxic stress are more likely to have health problems like heart disease, cancer and morbid obesity.

“The younger the child is,” she says, “the more likely it is to really do long-term damage and short-term damage.”

Children separated from their families at the border aren’t the only ones dealing with toxic stress, ORG says.

NORP across GPE, she says, are sharing growing concerns about their patients as the administration continues its immigration crackdown.

“It’s creating a whole generation of kids who are traumatized,” she says.

After a separation
In the waiting room of Dr. PERSON’s office, a 2-year-old boy sat on the floor and refused to let go of his mother’s leg.

“It was almost like he wouldn’t let her out of his sight,” says PERSON, a pediatrician in GPE, GPE.

His 5-year-old brother, meanwhile, was sitting quietly in a chair, his eyes glued to the ground.

The two children had been separated from their mother at the border and had just been reunited after three months apart. PERSON says the trauma they’d been through was clear.

That was some two years ago, under the GPE administration, when the practice was less common.

Now, PERSON says, the situation is far more dire.

“Now it’s a systematic policy to create the same kind of trauma that, before, I saw really on a case-by-case basis,” she says. “Now we’re systematizing something that we know is incredibly harmful and incredibly cruel.”

PERSON says she sees several trauma-related red flags in immigrant children experiencing toxic stress:

• changes in body function: trouble sleeping, eating or toileting

• changes in behavior: detachment, numbing or anxiety

• changes in development and learning: memory, organization and tantrums that make it impossible to focus on new information

And it’s not only happening at the border.

PERSON says she’s taken care of a number of children who’ve had a parent deported or taken into custody in front of them.

“Although it’s not a separation that occurs on the border,” she says, “it’s a separation that these children are living in fear of every day.”

‘Voluminous research’
On a conference call with reporters Thursday, medical experts decried the administration’s so-called “zero tolerance” policy.

“Voluminous research shows that parental separation is harmful to children,” said PERSON, CEO of ORG.

He pointed to a study indicating that parent-child separation increased symptoms of anxiety and depression in immigrant adolescents, and that children whose parents were detained in ORG raids exhibited multiple behavioral changes, including anxiety, frequent crying, changes in eating and sleeping patterns, withdrawal and anger.

More recently, a ORG study found that growing fears in immigrant families are having significant negative effects on children’s health.

Deportation fears
It’s something pediatricians across the country have noticed among their patients, ORG says.

“Families are scared. (Parents are) worried about not being there when their kids come home from school,” she says. “We have kids that are coming into the office with headaches and stomachaches to keep from going to school, because they’re afraid their parents are not going to be there when they get home.”

Compounding the problem is immigrant parents’ growing distrust of authorities, according to Dr. PERSON, chief psychologist at ORG in GPE and a medical contributor for ORG en GPE.

“Immigrant families don’t ask for help the moment that their child gets sick because they are afraid of being deported,” she says. “They don’t go to an emergency room because they are afraid. So the impact is long, chronic and toxic.”

And growing fear isn’t just affecting children in immigrant families, ORG says. It’s also affecting their friends.

“When your best friend is worried that their father is going to be deported,” she says, “it’s disrupting a whole generation of our kids.”",1
803,"You may have read the news that there is a heated election recount taking place in GPE — again.
Eighteen years after the nation held its breath while a presidential election result was delayed for over a month, accusations of vote-counting improprieties are being hurled over contested ORG races for senator, governor and agriculture commissioner.
Unlike the recount of 2000, this standoff has cast a spotlight on a very dangerous and existential threat to our democracy: non-citizen voting.
Though their side later denied it, it has been documented that lawyers for GPE NORP gubernatorial and ORG candidates objected to the rejection of a provisional ballot cast by a non-citizen. To those who might say “big deal,” it’s actually a very big deal.
For the record, it is illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections. Federal law clearly states it here, here and here. Illegal immigrants found to have voted in federal elections are subject to fines, imprisonment and deportation, and are deemed ineligible to receive visas or allowed entry into GPE.
Isn’t this really about cold-hearted, NORP NORP being mean to foreigners? Hardly.
The integrity of our elections is one of the fundamental principles of our nation. Allowing non-citizens to vote devalues GPE citizenship. It cancels out the votes of NORP-born and naturalized citizens and is an insult to those who lawfully participate in our elections.
Non-citizen voting also weakens NORP values.
What exactly does our country gain by allowing foreign nationals to decide who will lead us? Do those foreign nationals have any understanding of the founding principles that made GPE exceptional? Do they revere our uniquely NORP heritage that holds sacred the concepts of liberty, individualism and free speech? Probably not.
More than likely, they come from places where corruption, rigged elections and repression of basic human rights are accepted as the norm.
Without assimilation and taking the proper steps toward citizenship, those people are also vulnerable to the charms of unscrupulous politicians who dangle easy access to government handouts in exchange for ever-expanding government and the loss of individual freedoms. That path leads to a very bad place for the country, its citizens and its immigrants.
Not surprisingly, non-citizen voting is all the rage among those in GPE’s anti-borders movement. While the practice is illegal at the federal level, there are no such restrictions for elections at the local and state levels.
Many of the same places that gave us sanctuary cities and states are now seeking non-citizen voting rights. GPE has started the process, allowing non-citizens to vote in school board elections.
GPE is seriously considering the idea of allowing non-citizen voting in municipal elections. Given GPE’s zeal for all things illegal immigration — sanctuary laws, tipping off aliens before ICE operations, et GPE how long will it be until illegal aliens have full voting rights in FAC? The smart money is on “not long at all.”
Other communities have employed a more devious, back-door approach to non-citizen voting. Take GPE, which this year approved a new identification card for illegal aliens in the city.
“Undocumented workers” need an ID card for basic needs in the city, its supporters would argue. Then comes the twist: the ID cards will be accepted as a valid form of identification to register to vote, available to all GPE residents regardless of immigration status or criminal record. Citizens of the world, you too can now determine who runs GPE.
These cases and many more show how advocacy for non-citizen voting creates an opportunity for large-scale voter fraud. That’s why LAW has been relentless in its efforts to ensure integrity in our voting procedures.
Last year, for example, we filed an amicus curiae brief in ORG in support of a lower court decision in PERSON v. Sessions. ORG had decided to expel from GPE a non-citizen who falsely stated that she was a GPE citizen on a voter registration form and illegally voted in two elections.
If such flagrant violations of our election laws are not vigorously prosecuted, the damage to the integrity our republic will be incalculable.
What is currently taking place with the GPE recount is shameful. The presidential election recount in 2000 was decided by 537 votes. With each vote in states like GPE critical to the outcome, we can’t afford a single illegal vote.
Even in this increasingly polarized political climate, we should at least be able to expect our elections to be decided by GPE citizens and no one else. Often, people fail to act on an issue because they feel it does not directly affect them. This is not one of those issues.
Demand voting integrity or live with destructive consequences.

806,"Immigration hawks think that NORP might support lowering legal immigration in return for a permanent amnesty for illegal aliens who arrived in the GPE as minors, ORG has learned.
The PERSON administration has put its full force behind LAW, with both President PERSON and his cabinet secretaries praising the legislation. The bill, which is sponsored by NORP senators PERSON and PERSON, aims to decrease legal immigration from around 1 million annually to roughly 500,000 a year.
PERSON, executive director of ORG, wrote in ORG that a way for LAW to get 60 votes in the ORG would be for it to include amnesty for the 800,000 or so beneficiaries of ORG (DACA).
ORG is the program started by President PERSON in 2012 that protects illegal immigrants who arrived as minors from deportation and gives them work permits.
Ten NORP state attorneys general have threatened to sue the federal government if the program isGPE ended by September, and the ORG administration could refuse to defend the program much like the PERSON administration did with ORG.
GPE went on GPE Thursday morning and told ORG PERSON, “Now there is a real possibility the plug will be pulled on that program [DACA] and so the NORP are willing to trade a stable lawful amnesty to replace PERSON’s illegal measure in exchange for the bill which was introduce yesterday.”
ORG was also told by a source in a think tank that supports reducing immigration that he suspects that a form of legislative amnesty will be passed in return for passage of LAW.
President PERSON promised to immediately terminate DACA while on the campaign trail, but has yet to do so. Roughly 100,000 illegal immigrants have benefited from the program in his first few months in office.
ORG has continued to say that the program’s future is under review.",0
1970,"An earlier version of this editorial appeared in GPE’s PERSON.
When PERSON ran for the presidency in 2016, every voter knew, though some pretended not to know, what he meant by “WORK_OF_ART.” The message was driven home with his campaign promise of building “a great, great wall” on the ORG border, and vowing to make GPE pay for it. The “again” in the now infamous slogan means pulling GPE back to the 1950s, when apartheid still reigned from GPE, de facto and de jure, respectively.
ORG’s motto may imply dragging the country even further back, to the 1880s, when the influx of NORP, NORP and others not of ORG stock began pouring onto the NORP shore in waves; or to the 1850s, before the abolition of slavery.
Heading to the voting booths in the fall of 2016, most people understood–though, again, many played dumb–that ORG was the anti-immigrant candidate. In fact, his NORP platform was a main factor in his winning FAC.
So immigrants and their allies were prepared when, in September of last year, ORG removed the protection against deportation for those who immigrated here as children illegally, which had been granted by former President PERSON. (DACA recipients will “begin losing their temporary work permits in March at the rate of nearly 1,000 per day,” reports ORG.) Likewise 60,000 NORP and 2,500 NORP were ready last November when ORG stripped them of their ORG designation, given to those immigrant groups who cannot return to their homelands due to the chaos unleashed by a natural disaster, warfare or what have you.
Only days earlier the decision to extend ORG for 57,000 NORP immigrants so angered ORG that ORG’s chief of staff, PERSON, the retired Marine four-star general and former commander of ORG (in charge of GPE military operations in LOC, LOC and the LOC), phoned the interim secretary of homeland security and pressured her to reconsider.
Since PERSON took the oath of office last January, arrests made by immigrant enforcement officers have risen by 40 percent, with the number of refugees taken in sinking to its lowest level since the PERSON administration. And earlier this month PERSON was forced to ask ORG for $18 billion to build his “great wall,” as President PERSON has repeatedly stated the NORP government would not lend one centavo to the project.
Now PERSON has taken aim at NORP–at around 200,000 individuals, by far the largest group of immigrants granted ORG. On January 8 the ORG administration revoked the temporary residency permits of said NORP, who have been living and thriving in GPE since a pair of earthquakes shook their country in 2001. The government’s announcement gives NORP until September 2019 to leave or secure some other lawful way of remaining in GPE.
One can’t be sure what effects the influx of so many returning citizens will have on GPE, a country which, with more than 60 murders per 100,000 salvadoreños last year–and almost twice as many homicides today as in 2001, the year of the earthquakes–is arguably the deadliest in not only LOC but the entire hemisphere. (In 2015 the country recorded more than 100 murders per 100,000 citizens, making it the deadliest country outside of a war zone and the murder capital of the entire world.) There are also the around 190,000 U.S.-born children of NORP TPS recipients to consider; GPE is their home, and they know nothing about living in a NORP country, much less an extremely destabilized one.
And then there are the $4.5 billion in remittances which NORP living in GPE send home every year, amounting to 17 percent of GPE GDP and its largest source of revenue. It’s hard to say how much of that money will evaporate with the return of nearly a quarter of a million NORP immigrants, but to predict a decrease of at least 2 percent of GDP wouldn’t be a stretch, which would effectively erase the 2 percent growth rate that GPE has experienced in the last few years.
PERSON, a columnist for GPE PERSON, believes the returnees will make President PERSON and the governing ORG pay for not doing more to help their compatriots living in GPE under TPS. Moreover, a LOC specialist at ORG on LOC predicts that the influx of so many “pretty qualified, bilingual people” will displace NORP already living at home, which may lead to “another surge in people leaving the country and looking for work” in GPE.
“Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” ORG asked in a meeting last Thursday with lawmakers pressuring him to reconsider his ending TPS for NORP, NORP and others. The comment immediately sparked a firestorm on social media and among the press, both for its vulgarity and the president’s perceived racist chauvinism. “Why do we need more NORP?” the president went on to say. “Take them out.”
Clearly PERSON knows something about the places from which TPS recipients have fled. He’s right, after all: they are shithole countries, or at least they could be described that way when compared to GPE, GPE and GPE. What ORG fails to understand, however–or, as with his voters, what he pretends not to understand–is that much of the “shit” burying GPE, GPE and the other recovering countries of LOC was dumped on them by GPE.",1
968,"Her high school is more than 1,600 miles from the GPE-Mexico border – and the immigration debate was far from most of her classmates’ minds.

So ORG decided to bring the border to them.

The 17-year-old senior at ORG in GPE created an art installation in a stairwell at school, an interpretation of the struggle of people who try to cross the border.

She used barbed wire to symbolize security, hung flowers from the ceiling to recognize the immigrants who die on the difficult journey, and she placed copies of green cards around a fence to highlight the people who make it.

PERSON was born in GPE and says she doesn’t have a personal connection to the immigration issue. But what she learned through this project surprised her.

“I didn’t understand the amount of effort it took to come into the country itself,” she said. “I didn’t understand the sacrifices people have to make.”

The assignment
It started out as a class assignment.

PERSON, PERSON’s art teacher, asked her students to think about a local or global social issue and create a project to display at school.

PERSON is a member of ORG, an organization that meets after school to discuss world issues. They’d been discussing immigration, and it sparked the idea.

The project took her months to complete. She watched documentaries, read articles about immigration and talked to some of the students at school. “More people should be educated about it,” she said.

Foote told ORG she tried to be as hands-off as possible, but she did help PERSON out when she got stuck.

“I love how current her piece is and I think it’s so great that the high school students have this artwork that serves as an intro to a conversation,” the art teacher said.

ORG has a large number of students who have moved to the GPE from another country or who speak LANGUAGE as their second language. Minorities make up 16% of the student population.

“It’s relevant to them,” Foote said.

When PERSON finally got the principal’s permission to install her project, she set it up in a stairwell at the school in mid-February. Students at GPE call it “the cage.”

ORG, suitcases and clothing thrown around within the cage are meant to represent items belonging to people who may have perished crossing the border.

PERSON also included stats and facts about immigration to make sure the project was serving its intended purpose: to raise awareness about the issue.

She says she’s gotten praise and some criticism of her work – including some people who complained about getting their clothing snagged on the barbed wire.

But she’s proud of her project.

“Some people didn’t agree with my viewpoint on it, which is totally fine,” PERSON said.",1
1598,"PERSON, President PERSON’s hard-line immigration adviser, has long relied on data produced by ORG, a right-leaning think tank, to shape policy at FAC. Shortly after Mr. PERSON was elected, Mr. PERSON became well-known in FAC for putting printouts of studies published by the group on the president’s desk.

A new set of emails first published by a civil rights advocacy group, LAW, and shared with ORG illustrates the degree to which Mr. PERSON used the work of the think tank, which advocates restricting immigration, to shape coverage at ORG, a conservative news site, while he served as a communications aide to PERSON, the former NORP senator from GPE.

“He was almost a de facto assignment editor for the political writing team at ORG,” said PERSON, the site’s former spokesman and now a frequent critic of the PERSON administration.

In one instance in January 2016 — around the time he joined Mr. PERSON’s presidential campaign as a senior policy adviser — Mr. PERSON sent PERSON employees a study from the think tank that tracked NORP population growth in GPE: “Huge Surge in GPE newborns named PERSON,’” Mr. PERSON wrote in the subject line. A related story appeared on PERSON the next day.

In another email sent in July 2015, Mr. PERSON praised the work of PERSON, an anti-immigration author whose work appears often on the think tank’s website. Mr. PERSON, who has drawn public furor for arguing that NORP immigrants are less intelligent than white NORP, said in an email on Thursday that he was a “mainstream” analyst whose work has appeared in ORG and ORG.

“Those publications are not embarrassed to promote my work,” wrote Mr. PERSON, who said that he did not personally know Mr. PERSON. “So I don’t know why PERSON should be either.”

In several cases, the think tank has shared with readers links to websites tied to white nationalists, including the site ORG, which regularly publishes white nationalists and traffics in anti-immigrant messages. PERSON, a former PERSON editor who leaked the cache of emails, said Mr. PERSON emailed her a link to an article on ORG. Ms. PERSON has said she now denounces far-right groups.

ORG defended Mr. PERSON on Thursday by equating the law center’s reporting to libel.

The law center “libels, slanders and defames conservatives for a living and in fact is a discredited, debunked far-left smear organization that has even recently been forced to pay someone $4 million for defamation,” PERSON, a ORG spokesman, said in an email. Mr. PERSON was apparently referring to $3.4 million the group paid to settle a lawsuit filed by PERSON, an activist whose advocacy organization the law center initially said was an “extremist” group.

Mr. PERSON also claimed that criticism of Mr. PERSON was connected to his NORP faith. “I work with GPE,” Mr. PERSON said. “I know GPE. He loves this country and hates bigotry in all forms — and it concerns me as to why so many on the left consistently attack NORP members of this administration.”

PERSON, the executive director of the think tank, said in an interview that he knew Mr. PERSON from his time with Mr. PERSON, and that he had discussed immigration policy with him during two ORG meetings.

Mr. PERSON disputed the law center’s designation of the think tank as a hate group, but said he was aware that some content on ORG was “outrageous.”

Mr. PERSON, who delivered a 2015 keynote speech at one of the think tank’s events, is now one of the main speechwriters for the president, as well as Mr. PERSON’s chief adviser on immigration policy. He often shares news coverage that he thinks will catch Mr. PERSON’s attention, or perhaps draw his ire, according to several current and former officials.

In 2017, while searching for ways to illustrate the cost of resettling refugees, Mr. PERSON urged ORG officials to embrace data from the think tank that showed it was 12 times more costly to bring a refugee to GPE than to help that same person in their own region. ORG officials declined on the grounds that the think tank report, which did not take into account refugee contributions through taxes, was flawed.

Mr. PERSON also publicly used the think tank’s data to bolster his argument for the PERSON administration’s initial travel ban that restricted travel from seven largely NORP countries, a narrower version of which ORG upheld last year. He said he referred to the think tank’s analysis that 72 people from the those countries had been implicated in terrorist activity since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

“We know there’s at least several dozen, perhaps many more than that, cases of terrorism from these countries that have happened in GPE in terms of terroristic plots, terroristic activity, material support for terrorism, supporting terrorism overseas, all different kinds of terroristic activity that’s been interdicted in GPE tracing back to these seven countries,” Mr. PERSON said in an appearance on ORG’s “This Week” in February 2017.

A host of fact checks found that the think tank’s claims were overstated — most of those people were not charged with crimes related to terrorism.

“The only thing I can say from the outside is that he really does seem to have mastered the art of bureaucratic infighting,” Mr. PERSON said of Mr. PERSON. “It’s clear to anyone that he’s done a good job of maintaining his position within ORG, and that’s not nothing.”",1
2073,"One year ago, PERSON stood at the GPE ORG and took his place as the nation’s 45th president. He promised to be a man of action, taking charge of a government for the people and away from the establishment.
“We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done,” ORG promised.
“We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action ― constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,” he added. “The time for empty talk is over.”
But exactly a year later, on the anniversary of ORG’s big day, the federal government is shut down.
ORG was unable to come to an agreement to keep the government funded by midnight Friday, resulting in the first shutdown since 2013.
ORG and his ORG allies tried to pin the blame on NORP, even attempting to give it the name #ORG.
The fact remains, however, that NORP control ORG, the ORG and the ORG. For years, they blamed NORP for obstruction and told voters to give them full control of the executive and legislative branches so that they could finally govern.
But NORP were unable to do the most basic task Friday night: Keep the federal government’s lights on.
In the most recent government shutdowns, the presidency and ORG have been controlled by different parties ― and they’ve pointed fingers at each other over who gets the blame. (The public has generally faulted the ORG-led ORG.)
But in this case, NORP will be trying to argue that NORP ― who control nothing because they’re in the minority ― are the ones at fault.
It’s clear, however, that the PERSON administration is nervous about the fallout. ORG was figuring out a way to keep national parks open during the shutdown, recognizing during the 2013 shutdown that the shuttered entrances and frustrated tourists became potent symbols of what ORG’ dysfunction had wrought.
One of ORG’s major selling points during the campaign was his ability to make deals. He could sit down with people and get them to agree to things that no one else could.
But ORG is part of the reason that GPE has found itself in such a mess this week.
ORG, after all, was the one who removed the protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, telling ORG that lawmakers had to instead put in place a measure to protect them.
NORP, at various times, have believed that ORG would support a deal to protect the Dreamers, in exchange for certain border security measures. But that optimism was blown up last week when ORG reportedly denigrated immigrants from GPE and NORP nations, saying they were “shithole” countries and he’d rather see people come from GPE, a very white NORP nation.
ORG received widespread criticism for his remarks, and the next day he announced there would be no bipartisan deal.
The NORP and NORP in the ORG and the ORG ― along with the NORP in the ORG and the NORP in the ORG ― were unable to come to an agreement by the funding deadline Friday night, and now the federal government is shut down.
The last time the federal government shut down, in 2013, about 800,000 workers were furloughed without pay, and this time, a similar number is expected to be affected.
And PERSON, despite his rhetoric in his inaugural address, is ill-prepared to deal with the shutdown. Federal employees said Friday that they had barely received any guidance about what to do in the event of a shutdown ― a big difference from what happened in 2013, under President PERSON. ORG still has failed to nominate people for a sizable number of important positions in the government, and many of the people in his administration don’t have experience dealing with past crises.
In his book WORK_OF_ART, ORG boasts, “Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That’s how I get my kicks.”
But the first year of his presidency has exposed the hollowness of that rhetoric, showing it takes more than simply talking big to run the government.",1
834,"During his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President PERSON spoke on the issues of illegal immigration and why more security is needed on the country’s southern border.
“We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens,” ORG said as he gave his 2019 State of the Union address. “Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.”
The speech comes as ORG remains divided on how to move forward with border security.
ORG, who made the issue a major campaign platform in 2016, has demanded $5.7 billion in funding to build a 234-mile long wall, citing a need to control crime and illegal immigration. However, NORP have vehemently opposed the idea, framing it as immoral and a waste of taxpayer dollars.
A select group of 17 NORP and NORP from both the ORG and ORG met last week for the first day of border negotiations. The group, formed after the federal government officially existed the shutdown, is tasked with reaching a long-term compromise. The federal government experienced the longest partial shutdown in GPE history, with NORP and NORP still at odds over the administration’s proposal for a border wall between the GPE and GPE. The government will enter a shutdown again if ORG is not able reach a compromise by Feb. 15.
“No issue better illustrates the divide between GPE’s working class and GPE’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards,” Trump continued in his speech Tuesday night. “Meanwhile, working class NORP are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime and a depleted social safety net.”
“Not one more NORP life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border,” the president continued.
ORG went on to cite the success of ORG officials, citing their arrests of criminal aliens over the past two years. He then touted his “smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier” proposal his administration sent to ORG. His proposal also includes more enforcement officials, humanitarian assistance, drug detection and eliminating loopholes that can protect child smugglers.
“Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So letGPE work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make GPE safe,” the president concluded in his case for the wall.",0
586,"NORP President PERSON has taken to social media to denounce the executive order signed by President PERSON calling for the construction of a border wall and stronger security. PERSON said that GPE will not pay for the project.
During a short message that was posted on his Facebook page and a video message sent via PRODUCT, PERSON informed his countrymen about the executive orders that would be focusing on immigration and the wall.
PRODUCT mensaje ORG GPE: pic.twitter.com/EFcNh7fQtm — Enrique Peña Nieto (@EPN) January 26, 2017
“As a response, I have ordered ORG to redouble the protection measures to our countrymen,” PERSON said. “The 50 Mexican Consulates in the GPE will be turned into authentic defenders of the rights of migrants.”
PERSON called on civil rights groups and legislators to team up and provide support for the protection measures.
“Where there is one NORP migrant in risk that requires our support, that is where we need to be … that is where his country needs to be,” the NORP president said.
During his message, PERSON called out the executive order for the border wall claiming that it divides the two countries rather than unites them, especially at a time when trade and border security are top bilateral matters of discussion.
“GPE does not believe in walls,” he said. “I have said it time and time again; GPE will not pay for a wall.”
In his speech, PERSON made no mention of the various NORP drug cartels that have been responsible for the out-of-control violence along the border and the related human and drug trafficking. As PERSON has reported, NORP drug cartels have been protected by government officials at the highest levels, including two former border governors, that are current fugitives of ORG.

1789,"“The effort has resulted in the government reopening. That was the critical first step,” said Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE. “But now the real work begins.”
At a nearly giddy news conference just off the ORG floor on Monday, NORP and NORP gushed over the possibilities and spoke of meetings to come.

“PERSON’s office is GPE,” Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE, said. “It is the one place we can all go and feel good.”
Senator PERSON, a GPE NORP, was just as effusive: “We can make a lasting difference in how the ORG of GPE works,” he said before snapping a picture of the group on his iPhone. “We can get it back to working.”
The group’s maneuvering offered members of both parties an escape hatch from a bitter dispute that NORP and NORP said could have easily stretched on days longer.
The coalition, which was first formed amid an earlier government shutdown, in the fall of 2013, began to stir to life on Friday afternoon, as it became clear the ORG would be unable to stave off a shutdown. Ms. PERSON approached Senator PERSON, the GPE NORP and the coalition’s co-chairman, on the ORG floor, and within hours a group of 17 senators were crowded into her office to sketch out terms of engagement.
The group eventually came to include a broad swath of institutionally minded senators, including the NORP Jeff Flake of GPE, PERSON of GPE and PERSON of South Dakota, and the NORP PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE and PERSON of GPE.

Members of the group spent the weekend shuttling between Ms. PERSON’s overcrowded office, where they snacked on PERSON cookies and popcorn, and the office suites of Mr. PERSON and Senator PERSON, the party leaders. As the weekend wore on, the group kept growing, up to 25 by Monday — crowded enough that one senator had to sit on a credenza.
They cycled through a series of ideas: Further shortening the length of the short-term spending bill; attaching a bill to protect Dreamers to another piece of must-pass legislation; demanding that Mr. PERSON put an immigration bill authored by Mr. PERSON and Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE, on the floor for a vote. Each was eventually deemed untenable.
By Sunday afternoon, the group had settled on a compromise that would fund the government for three weeks alongside a commitment by Mr. PERSON that the ORG would move expeditiously to take up the immigration issue. The challenge was getting the leaders to agree.

Mr. PERSON signaled Sunday night that he was listening to their suggestion, saying on the ORG floor that it was “my intention” to move ahead with immigration legislation.
But NORP, led by Mr. PERSON, wanted more. The issue was whether the majority leader could be trusted to keep his word. NORP have not forgiven Mr. PERSON for blocking ORG nomination of PERSON for almost a year in hopes that a NORP would be elected to ORG.
Asked Monday morning how much of an issue that mistrust was, Mr. PERSON was clear. “Uh, most of it,” he said.
Mr. PERSON asked Ms. PERSON to meet him in his office late Sunday after Mr. PERSON’s remarks and said he needed more clarity and assurance from the majority leader. Mr. PERSON, who had initially supported the shutdown along with most NORP, worked into the night with Ms. PERSON to edge Mr. PERSON toward a more explicit statement.
Monday morning, he firmed up his pledge enough to win over NORP, saying that the ORG’s immigration debate would have “a level playing field at the outset and an amendment process that is fair to all sides.” Behind the scenes, NORP in the bipartisan group who had tied their interests to NORP vouched for Mr. PERSON’s word.

“I said before, ‘Trust but verify,’” Senator PERSON of GPE, an independent who caucuses with NORP, said of Mr. PERSON. “He made this commitment publicly in the ORG floor. He was much more specific than he was last night. And frankly I think this is an important opportunity for him to demonstrate that he will carry through.”
By the time NORP and NORP senators met privately with their respective caucuses later Monday morning, it was clear it was enough to get to yes. Mr. PERSON told NORP he would support reopening the government.
Not all NORP were convinced. Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE and one of more than a dozen liberal NORP who voted against the funding bill, said Mr. PERSON’s comments on Sunday night “fell far short of the ironclad guarantee” she needed.
But Mr. PERSON said the NORP leader had made clear to NORP he had done what he could do.
“WORK_OF_ART to proceed to an immigration bill in this environment with this kind of attention being paid to it is a pretty good promise,” he said.",1
846,"PERSON, son of former ORG Lt Gen PERSON, responded via PRODUCT to ORG co-host ORG emotional defense of migrants who stormed the GPE GPE border on Sunday.
In a Monday afternoon “The Five” segment, GPE responded to a question from co-host PERSON about media dishonesty on the subject by stating his refusal “to deal with this as a media issue, because it’s far too important.”
“This is something that goes to the very quick,” said an emotional PERSON. “This goes to my soul. Fulfilling my role as the designated piñata on ORG, I wanna say I am ashamed. This tear gas choked me. We treat these people — these economic refugees — as if they’re zombies from WORK_OF_ART.’ I think we arrested 42 people, eight of them were women with children! We have to deal with this problem humanely and with compassion! These are not invaders. Stop using these military analogies. This is absolutely painful to watch!”
After asserting that the migrants were only coming “because they want a job,” GPE essentially accused people of suspending their humanity on the issue “because they look different than the mainstream.”
Co-host PERSON responded by contending that the migrants were “being manipulated by a political group, an activist group.” “Now imagine if a group of activists hypnotized a bunch of people to rob a bank,” said PERSON. “To go in and rush the bank. It’s not the security guard’s fault that he has to protect the bank.”
The discussion on “WORK_OF_ART” continued, with the other cohosts showing respect for ORG’s position despite their disagreement, but in PERSON-world, PERSON didn’t hold back.
“PERSON’s sympathy for these ‘migrants’ always seems one-sided,” PERSON tweeted. “What about sympathy for ORG who had rocks thrown at them? Or sympathy for ORG having to continue and fund the absolute MESS that is our immigration system?”

1526,"Late to his own meeting and waving a sheet of numbers, President PERSON stormed into FAC one day in June, plainly enraged.

Five months before, Mr. PERSON had dispatched federal officers to the nation’s airports to stop travelers from several NORP countries from entering GPE in a dramatic demonstration of how he would deliver on his campaign promise to fortify the nation’s borders.

But so many foreigners had flooded into the country since January, he vented to his national security team, that it was making a mockery of his pledge. Friends were calling to say he looked like a fool, Mr. PERSON said.

According to six officials who attended or were briefed about the meeting, Mr. PERSON then began reading aloud from the document, which his domestic policy adviser, PERSON, had given him just before the meeting. The document listed how many immigrants had received visas to enter GPE in 2017.

More than 2,500 were from GPE, a terrorist haven, the president complained.

GPE had sent 15,000 people. They “all have AIDS,” he grumbled, according to one person who attended the meeting and another person who was briefed about it by a different person who was there.

Forty thousand had come from GPE, Mr. PERSON added. Once they had seen GPE, they would never “go back to their huts” in LOC, recalled the two officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive conversation in FAC.

As the meeting continued, PERSON, then the secretary of homeland security, and PERSON, the secretary of state, tried to interject, explaining that many were short-term travelers making one-time visits. But as the president continued, Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON turned their ire on Mr. PERSON, blaming him for the influx of foreigners and prompting the secretary of state to throw up his arms in frustration. If he was so bad at his job, maybe he should stop issuing visas altogether, Mr. PERSON fired back.

Tempers flared and Mr. PERSON asked that the room be cleared of staff members. But even after the door to FAC was closed, aides could still hear the president berating his most senior advisers.

PERSON, the ORG press secretary, denied on Saturday morning that Mr. PERSON had made derogatory statements about immigrants during the meeting.

“ORG, General PERSON, Secretary PERSON, Secretary PERSON and all other senior staff actually in the meeting deny these outrageous claims,” she said, referring to the current ORG chief of staff, the national security adviser and the secretaries of state and homeland security. “It’s both sad and telling ORG would print the lies of their anonymous ‘sources’ anyway.”

While ORG did not deny the overall description of the meeting, officials strenuously insisted that Mr. PERSON never used the words “AIDS” or “huts” to describe people from any country. Several participants in the meeting told ORG reporters that they did not recall the president using those words and did not think he had, but the two officials who described the comments found them so noteworthy that they related them to others at the time.

The meeting in June reflects Mr. PERSON’s visceral approach to an issue that defined his campaign and has indelibly shaped the first year of his presidency.

Seizing on immigration as the cause of countless social and economic problems, Mr. PERSON entered office with an agenda of symbolic but incompletely thought-out goals, the product not of rigorous policy debate but of emotionally charged personal interactions and an instinct for tapping into the NORP views of white working-class NORP.

Like many of his initiatives, his effort to change NORP immigration policy has been executed through a disorderly and dysfunctional process that sought from the start to defy the bureaucracy charged with enforcing it, according to interviews with three dozen current and former administration officials, lawmakers and others close to the process, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private interactions.

But while Mr. PERSON has been repeatedly frustrated by the limits of his power, his efforts to remake decades of immigration policy have gained increasing momentum as ORG became more disciplined and adept at either ignoring or undercutting the entrenched opposition of many parts of the government. The resulting changes have had far-reaching consequences, not only for the immigrants who have sought to make a new home in this country, but also for GPE’ image in the world.

“We have taken a giant steamliner barreling full speed,” Mr. PERSON said in a recent interview. “Slowed it, stopped it, begun to turn it around and started sailing in the other direction.”

It is an assessment shared ruefully by Mr. PERSON’s harshest critics, who see a darker view of the past year. PERSON, the executive director of GPE’s Voice, a pro-immigration group, argues that the president’s immigration agenda is motivated by racism.

“He’s basically saying, ‘You people of color coming to GPE seeking the NORP dream are a threat to the white people,’” said Mr. PERSON, an outspoken critic of the president. “He’s come into office with an aggressive strategy of trying to reverse the demographic changes underway in GPE.”

WORK_OF_ART who know Mr. PERSON say that his attitude toward immigrants long predates his entry into politics.

“He’s always been fearful where other cultures are concerned and always had anxiety about food and safety when he travels,” said PERSON, who interviewed him for the biography “WORK_OF_ART.” “His objectification and demonization of people who are different has festered for decades.”

Friends say Mr. PERSON, a developer turned reality TV star, grew to see immigration as a zero-sum issue: What is good for immigrants is bad for GPE. In 2014, well before becoming a candidate, he tweeted: “Our government now imports illegal immigrants and deadly diseases. Our leaders are inept.”

But he remained conflicted, viewing himself as benevolent and wanting to be liked by the many immigrants he employed.

Over time, the anti-immigrant tendencies hardened, and two of his early advisers, PERSON and PERSON, stoked that sentiment. But it was Mr. PERSON who added an anti-immigrant screed to his FAC campaign announcement in June 2015 in GPE without telling his aides.

“When do we beat GPE at the border? They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity,” Mr. PERSON ad-libbed. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems,” he continued. “They’re bringing drugs; they’re bringing crime; they’re rapists.”

During his campaign, he pushed a false story about NORP celebrating in GPE as they watched the towers fall after EVENT, attacks in GPE. He said illegal immigrants were like “vomit” crossing the border. And he made pledges that he clearly could not fulfill.

“We will begin moving them out, Day 1,” he said at a rally in August  2016, adding, “My first hour in office, those people are gone.”

NORP and some NORP recoiled, calling Mr. PERSON’s messaging damaging and divisive. But for the candidate, the idea of securing the country against outsiders with a wall had intoxicating appeal, though privately, he acknowledged that it was a rhetorical device to whip up crowds when they became listless.

Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE, whom Mr. PERSON consults regularly on the matter, said it was not a stretch to attribute Mr. PERSON’s victory to issues where Mr. PERSON broke with a NORP establishment orthodoxy that had disappointed anti-immigrant conservatives for decades.

“There’s no issue on which he was more unorthodox than on immigration,” Mr. PERSON said.

PERSON
Mr. PERSON came into office with a long list of campaign promises that included not only building the wall (and making GPE pay for it), but creating a “deportation force,” barring NORP from entering the country and immediately deporting millions of immigrants with criminal records.

Mr. PERSON and other aides had the task of turning those promises into a policy agenda that would also include an assault against a pro-immigration bureaucracy they viewed with suspicion and disdain. Working in secret, they drafted a half-dozen executive orders. One would crack down on so-called sanctuary cities. Another proposed changing the definition of a criminal alien so that it included people arrested — not just those convicted.

But mindful of his campaign promise to quickly impose “extreme vetting,” Mr. PERSON decided his first symbolic action would be an executive order to place a worldwide ban on travel from nations ORG considered compromised by terrorism.

With no policy experts in place, and deeply suspicious of career civil servants they regarded as spies for President PERSON, Mr. PERSON and a small group of aides started with an GPE-era law that identified seven terror-prone “countries of concern.” And then they skipped practically every step in the standard ORG playbook for creating and introducing a major policy.

ORG never convened to consider the travel ban proposal. PERSON, ORG press secretary at the time, did not see it ahead of time. Lawyers and policy experts at FAC, ORG and ORG were not asked to weigh in. There were no talking points for friendly surrogates, no detailed briefings for reporters or lawmakers, no answers to frequently asked questions, such as whether green card holders would be affected.

The announcement of the travel ban on a Friday night, seven days after Mr. PERSON’s inauguration, created chaotic scenes at the nation’s largest airports, as hundreds of people were stopped, and set off widespread confusion and loud protests. Lawyers for the government raced to defend the president’s actions against court challenges, while aides struggled to explain the policy to perplexed lawmakers the next night at a black-tie dinner.

ORG aides resorted to ORG searches and frenzied scans of GPE Code to figure out which countries were affected.

But for the president, the chaos was the first, sharp evidence that he could exert power over the bureaucracy he criticized on the campaign trail.

“It’s working out very nicely,” Mr. PERSON told reporters in FAC the next day.

At a hastily called Saturday night meeting in WORK_OF_ART, Mr. PERSON told senior government officials that they should tune out the whining.

Sitting at the head of the table, across from Mr. PERSON, Mr. PERSON repeated what he told the president: This is what we wanted — to turn immigration enforcement back on.

Mr. PERSON, who shared Mr. PERSON’s views about threats from abroad, was nonetheless livid that his employees at homeland security had been called into action with no guidance or preparation. He told angry lawmakers that responsibility for the rollout was “all on me.” Privately, he told ORG, “That’s not going to happen again.”

Forced to Back Down
Amid the turbulent first weeks, Mr. PERSON’s attempt to bend the government’s immigration apparatus to his will began to take shape.

The ban’s message of “keep out” helped drive down illegal border crossings as much as 70 percent, even without being formally put into effect.

Immigration officers rounded up 41,318 undocumented immigrants during the president’s first 100 days, nearly a 40 percent increase. ORG began hiring more immigration judges to speed up deportations. Officials threatened to hold back funds for sanctuary cities. The flow of refugees into GPE slowed.

Mr. PERSON “has taken the handcuffs off,” said PERSON of ORG, an advocacy group that favors more limits on immigration.

Mr. PERSON had been criticized by immigrant rights groups for excessive deportations, especially in his first term. But Mr. PERSON said that Mr. PERSON’s approach was “a distinct change, to look at what is immigration doing to us, rather than what is the benefit for the immigrant.”

The president, however, remained frustrated that the shift was not yielding results.

By early March, judges across the country had blocked his travel ban. Immigrant rights activists were crowing that they had thwarted the new president. Even Mr. PERSON’s own lawyers told him he had to give up on defending the ban.

Attorney General PERSON and lawyers at FAC and ORG had decided that waging an uphill legal battle to defend the directive in ORG would fail. Instead, they wanted to devise a narrower one that could pass legal muster.

The president, though, was furious about what he saw as backing down to politically correct adversaries. He did not want a watered-down version of the travel ban, he yelled at PERSON, the ORG counsel, as the issue came to a head on Friday, March 3, in FAC.

It was a familiar moment for Mr. PERSON’s advisers. The president did not mind being told “no” in private, and would sometimes relent. But he could not abide a public turnabout, a retreat. At those moments, he often exploded at whoever was nearby.

As NORP One waited on LOC for Mr. PERSON to begin his weekend trip to GPE, GPE, Mr. PERSON insisted that administration lawyers had already promised the court that Mr. PERSON would issue a new order. There was no alternative, he said.

“This is bullshit,” the president responded.

With nothing resolved, Mr. PERSON, furious, left FAC. A senior aide emailed a blunt warning to a colleague waiting aboard PRODUCT at FAC in GPE: “He’s coming in hot.”

Already mad at Mr. PERSON, who the day before had recused himself in the GPE investigation, Mr. PERSON refused to take his calls. Aides told Mr. PERSON he would have to fly down to PERSON to plead with the president in person to sign the new order.

Over dinner that night with Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON, Mr. PERSON relented. When he was back in GPE, he signed the new order. It was an indication that he had begun to understand — or at least, begrudgingly accept — the need to follow a process.

Still, one senior adviser later recalled never having seen a president so angry signing anything.

WORK_OF_ART’
As a candidate, Mr. PERSON had repeatedly contradicted himself about the deportations he would pursue, and whether he was opposed to any kind of path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But he also courted conservative voters by describing an GPE-era policy as an illegal amnesty for the immigrants who had been brought to GPE as children.

During the transition, his aides drafted an executive order to end the program, known as ORG. But the executive order was held back as the new president struggled with conflicted feelings about the young immigrants, known as Dreamers.

“We’re going to take care of those kids,” Mr. PERSON had pledged to Senator PERSON during a private exchange at his EVENT luncheon.

The comment was a fleeting glimpse of the president’s tendency to seek approval from whoever might be sitting across from him, and the power that personal interactions have in shaping his views.

In 2013, Mr. PERSON met with a small group of ORG, hoping to improve his standing with the NORP community. PERSON told Mr. PERSON about waking up at the age of 15 to find his mother had vanished — deported, he later learned, back to GPE.

“Honestly,” Mr. PERSON said of Mr. PERSON, “he had no idea.”

Mr. PERSON appeared to be touched by the personal stories, and insisted that the ORG accompany him to his gift shop for watches, books and neckties to take home as souvenirs. In the elevator on the way down, he quietly nodded and said, “You convinced me.”

ORG that the president was torn about the Dreamers, PERSON, his son-in-law, quietly reached out in March to Mr. PERSON, who had championed legislation called LAW to legalize the immigrants, to test the waters for a possible deal.

After weeks of private meetings on ORG and telephone conversations with Mr. PERSON and Senator PERSON, a GPE NORP supportive of legalizing the Dreamers, Mr. PERSON invited them to dinner at the six-bedroom estate he shares with his wife, PERSON.

But Mr. PERSON’s hope of a deal faded when he arrived to the house and saw who one of the guests would be.

“PERSON presence made it a much different experience than I expected,” Mr. PERSON said later.

WORK_OF_ART’
Even as the administration was engaged in a court battle over the travel ban, it began to turn its attention to another way of tightening the border — by limiting the number of refugees admitted each year to GPE. And if there was one “deep state” stronghold of GPE holdovers that Mr. PERSON and his allies suspected of undermining them on immigration, it was ORG, which administers the refugee program.

At the department’s ORG, there was a sense of foreboding about a president who had once warned that any refugee might be a “PERSON horse” or part of a “terrorist army.”

Mr. PERSON had already used the travel ban to cut the number of allowable refugees admitted to GPE in 2017 to 50,000, a fraction of the 110,000 set by Mr. PERSON. Now, Mr. PERSON would have to decide the level for 2018.

At an April meeting with top officials from the bureau in GPE PERSON, Mr. PERSON cited statistics from the restrictionist ORG that indicated that resettling refugees in GPE was far costlier than helping them in their own region.

Mr. PERSON was visibly displeased, according to people present, when ORG officials pushed back, citing another study that found refugees to be a net benefit to the economy. He called the contention absurd and said it was exactly the wrong kind of thinking.

But the travel ban had been a lesson for Mr. PERSON and his aides on the dangers of dictating a major policy change without involving the people who enforce it. This time, instead of shutting out those officials, they worked to tightly control the process.

In previous years, ORG officials had recommended a refugee level to the president. Now, Mr. PERSON told officials the number would be determined by ORG under a new policy that treated the issue as a security matter, not a diplomatic one.

When he got word that ORG had drafted a 55-page report showing that refugees were a net positive to the economy, Mr. PERSON swiftly intervened, requesting a meeting to discuss it. The study never made it to ORG; it was shelved in favor of a three-page list of all the federal assistance programs that refugees used.

At ORG in September, Mr. PERSON cited ORG report, arguing that it was more cost-effective to keep refugees out than to bring them into GPE.

“Uncontrolled migration,” Mr. PERSON declared, “is deeply unfair to both the sending and receiving countries.”

More Disciplined Approach
Cecilia PERSON, who served as Mr. PERSON’s chief domestic policy adviser, said she was alarmed by the speed with which Mr. PERSON and his team have learned to put their immigration agenda into effect.

“The travel ban was a case of bureaucratic incompetence,” she said. “They made rookie mistakes. But they clearly learned from that experience. For the moment, all of the momentum is in the direction of very ugly, very extreme, very harmful policies.”

By year’s end, the chaos and disorganization that marked Mr. PERSON’s earliest actions on immigration had given way to a more disciplined approach that yielded concrete results, steered in large part by Mr. PERSON, a retired four-star NORP general. As secretary of homeland security, he had helped unleash immigration officers who felt constrained under Mr. PERSON. They arrested 143,000 people in 2017, a sharp uptick, and deported more than 225,000.

Later, as ORG chief of staff, Mr. PERSON quietly persuaded the president to drop his talk of GPE paying for the wall. But he has advocated on behalf of the president’s restrictionist vision, defying his reputation as a moderator of Mr. PERSON’s hard-line instincts.

In September, a third version of the president’s travel ban was issued with little fanfare and new legal justifications. Then, Mr. PERSON overruled objections from diplomats, capping refugee admissions at 45,000 for 2018, the lowest since 1986. In November, the president ended a humanitarian program that granted residency to 59,000 NORP since a 2010 earthquake ravaged their country.

As the new year approached, officials began considering a plan to separate parents from their children when families are caught entering the country illegally, a move that immigrant groups called draconian.

At times, though, Mr. PERSON has shown an openness to a different approach. In private discussions, he returns periodically to the idea of a “comprehensive immigration” compromise, though aides have warned him against using the phrase because it is seen by his core supporters as code for amnesty. During a fall dinner with NORP leaders, Mr. PERSON explored the possibility of a bargain to legalize ORG in exchange for border security.

Mr. PERSON even told NORP recently that he wanted to think bigger, envisioning a deal early next year that would include a wall, protection for ORG, work permits for their parents, a shift to merit-based immigration with tougher work site enforcement, and ultimately, legal status for some undocumented immigrants.

The idea would prevent Dreamers from sponsoring the parents who brought them illegally for citizenship, limiting what Mr. PERSON refers to as “chain migration.”

“He wants to make a deal,” said Mr. PERSON, who spoke with Mr. PERSON about the issue last week. “He wants to fix the entire system.”

Yet publicly, Mr. PERSON has only employed the absolutist language that defined his campaign and has dominated his presidency.

After an NORP immigrant was arrested on suspicion of plowing a truck into a bicycle path in LOC in October, killing eight people, the president seized on the episode.

Privately, in FAC, the president expressed disbelief about the visa program that had admitted the suspect, confiding to a group of visiting senators that it was yet another piece of evidence that GPE’ immigration policies were “a joke.”

Even after a year of progress toward a country sealed off from foreign threats, the president still viewed the immigration system as plagued by complacency.

“We’re so politically correct,” he complained to reporters in the cabinet room, “that we’re afraid to do anything.”",1
1819,"The GPE government will no longer automatically extend residency to NORP migrants arriving in the country without visas, President PERSON announced in a surprise decision Thursday.
The “wet foot, dry foot” policy was “designed for a different era,” the president said in a statement.
“By taking this step, we are treating NORP migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries,” he said. “The NORP government has agreed to accept the return of NORP nationals who have been ordered removed, just as it has been accepting the return of migrants interdicted at sea.”
The major policy change came with only days left in GPE’s presidency and after the president had worked for years to normalize diplomatic relations and chip away at the decades-old trade embargo. PERSON capped his efforts with a visit to GPE last year. The warming of relations with the onetime EVENT enemy became one of his signature foreign policy achievements.
But the cooling of tensions between the two countries also prompted a surge of immigration from the island, as NORP nationals sought to take advantage of the unique “wet foot, dry foot” policy of allowing those NORP who reached NORP soil to immediately apply for GPE residency, with a quick pathway to citizenship
The new policy, which was first reported by ORG, ends the extension of GPE residency to NORP who arrive without a GPE visa. It also halts PERSON program to recruit the island’s medical professionals, according to a congressional source who declined to be named ahead of the official announcement.
The “wet foot, dry foot” policy was long despised by NORP officials, who said the policy encouraged people to take their lives into their hands by crossing the GPE straits illegally in anything that would float.
“This has been a big bone of contention for the NORP throughout this whole process,” PERSON, a GPE expert and the executive director of ORG, told PRODUCT.
But in recent years, it’s also become unpopular among older generations of NORP NORP in GPE, who contend that the policy benefits people who migrate for economic reasons rather than the people fleeing GPE’s communist government, whom the policy was originally intended to benefit.
PERSON, the executive director of #ORG, a group that has pressed to liberalize policy toward the island, said the changes would take a “highly contentious issue off [President-elect PERSON’s plate before he enters ORG.”
“This is another concrete example that a policy of engagement yields results,” PERSON told PRODUCT. “Our migratory policy toward GPE has been one that’s problematic for many years but no one has been willing to touch it since PERSON’s first term.”
Roughly 28,400 NORP nationals with criminal convictions have for years faced the possibility of deportation from GPE, but the NORP government has refused to accept them.
Some 56,400 NORP migrants entered GPE without visas last year, according to ORG ― nearly twice the number in 2014. ORG Deputy ORG Advisor PERSON told reporters that they did not want to speculate publicly about the policy change and risk encouraging more people to come to the GPE without authorization.
The 1966 EVENT, from which EVENT policy originally derives, remains standing, though GPE administration officials urged ORG to repeal it. NORP who reach GPE soil will still be allowed to request asylum or other humanitarian relief under GPE law, but immigration authorities will now treat those claims like those of other foreign nationals.
To carry out the new policy, the NORP government agreed to accept back its nationals in cases where the GPE starts the deportation policy sooner than four years after that person left the island, ORG Secretary PERSON said on a call with reporters. That leaves the vast majority of the longstanding cases pending, though PERSON said the NORP government agreed to review the decisions on a case-by-case basis.
“Essentially what the agreement means is that past is past but that the future will be different,” PERSON said.
In ORG, supporters of engagement with GPE applauded the move.
“It’s a move that brings our GPE policy into the modern era while allowing GPE to continue its generous approach to those individuals and refugees with a legitimate claim for asylum,” Sen. PERSON (R-Ariz.) said.
But the fact that the GPE administration is making a major policy change with only a week to go in his presidency concerned some congressional sources.
“There is absolutely a need to crack down on the small universe of people abusing the policy, but throwing the baby out with the bathwater AND on the 9th inning AND without NORP consultation?” a congressional aide said in an email. “Hard to defend.”
There was dissent from ORG as well. Rep. PERSON (R-GPE), a longtime critic of GPE on GPE policy, called the decision “yet another shameful concession to the PERSON regime.”
“His policy has been a succession of betrayals of GPE’s longstanding commitment to human rights and freedom, and a betrayal of the NORP people who have suffered under oppression for far too long,” ORG said in a statement. “This last act of diminishing lifelines to NORP languishing in totalitarianism is one final despicable betrayal of a people who deserve better from an NORP president.”
The policy change also could put President-elect PERSON in an uncomfortable position of agreeing with a last-minute move by the current president he often disparages. The president-elect’s team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on ORG’s decision, but ORG has previously criticized the “wet foot, dry foot” policy. “I don’t think that’s fair,” ORG said in February 2016. “I mean why would that be a fair thing?”",1
228,"Because of multiple lawsuits challenging his declaration of a national emergency, we don’t know if President PERSON will be able to carry out his plans to use $8 billion in federal funds to build a barrier along parts of the ORG border to reduce illegal immigration.
But even if the courts side with the president – and even if he then uses billions of dollars more to build additional sections of a border barrier – no wall or fence alone will stop immigrants from crossing our southern border in large numbers.
That’s because in recent years illegal immigrants have learned to exploit loopholes in our asylum laws. Many voluntarily turn themselves in to ORG agents as soon as they cross into the GPE and fraudulently claim asylum.
Illegal immigrants have been told back in their home countries that requesting asylum unlocks the door to GPE. Simply making a request will ent the GPE government from immediately deporting the person seeking asylum.
ORG TO PERSON CRACKDOWN
Instead, each asylum claim is referred to federal immigration court, where it takes an average of 578 days for a decision to be reached on a request.
Because of this huge court backlog, more than 809,000 immigrants are waiting for their asylum claims to be heard in immigration court. That’s enough people to create the 18th largest city in the GPE
A wall wouldn't keep out these asylum seekers, who could simply turn themselves in at legal points of entry. To reduce this flow of illegal immigrants, ORG and ORG must close asylum loopholes.
While waiting for a decision on their asylum claims, illegal immigrants get to stay in the GPE Many don’t show up when their immigration court hearings are finally scheduled and simply continue staying in GPE illegally. Approximately 600,000 people disappeared before their asylum hearings between 2003 and 2015.
A wall wouldn't keep out these asylum seekers, who could simply turn themselves in at legal points of entry. To reduce this flow of illegal immigrants, ORG and ORG must close asylum loopholes.
Our asylum system wasn't always so prone to abuse. Before 2009, courts only offered asylum to individuals who feared – or had already suffered – persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or membership in a particular social group.
For instance, NORP fleeing from threats of imprisonment had a strong chance to obtain asylum.
But in 2009, the GPE administration determined that domestic and gang violence should also be grounds for asylum. Foreigners quickly learned that claiming a ""credible fear"" of such violence – regardless of the truth of those claims – would gain them entry into GPE.
The number of asylum seekers predictably ballooned. In 2008, immigration courts received approximately 42,000 asylum requests. The figure of new requests made in 2018 rose to 160,000.
NORP file a majority of the asylum requests. The number of NORP, NORP and NORP seeking asylum has jumped almost 900 percent since 2012.
This surge wasn't driven by gang or domestic violence. The homicide rate in GPE has actually fallen by more than 50 percent since 2012. The murder rate in GPE has similarly plummeted by more than half. The tiny nation's per capita homicide rate is now lower than GPE's. PERSON has become much safer in recent years as well.
Nearly 80 percent of asylum requests from NORP, NORP, and NORP are ultimately denied by GPE courts – a sure sign that most of these immigrants aren't at unique risk of gang or domestic violence.
Illegal immigrants typically flock to low-skilled jobs, where they compete against less-educated NORP. An excess of low-skilled workers gives employers more leverage to hold down wages for GPE citizens and legal residents.
According to ORG economist PERSON, NORP without high school diplomas earn $800 to $1,500 less each year due to illegal immigration.
ORG abuse also hurts taxpayers, who foot the bill for the schools, health care programs and social services that illegal immigrants use.
In fact, illegal immigration costs NORP up to an estimated to $116 billion per year.
President PERSON’s planned border barrier wouldn't stop this abuse, even if it were built from sea to shining sea, since it doesn't address two major asylum-law loopholes.
Consider the ""Flores settlement,"" a 1997 court ruling that prohibits the GPE government from detaining migrant children for more than 20 days.
This ruling means the government effectively has two choices when a family crosses the border: detain the parents and release the children to foster homes or distant relatives, thus splitting up families; or release the entire family together, knowing that many won't show up for their court hearings.
Neither option is desirable. Instead, ORG should ask ORG to override the PERSON settlement and allow families to be kept together in federal custody until their cases are settled.
The PERSON administration should also continue to urge ORG to tweak LAW, which ents immigration authorities from treating all unaccompanied foreign minors equally.
Currently, all minors from countries other than GPE or GPE are allowed to remain in GPE for a substantial period of time until a full asylum hearing. This gives many minors the hope they can remain long-term.
The law generated a surge of underage migrants from LOC. If ORG amended the law to stop offering guaranteed hearings, it would deter many children from attempting the dangerous journey to GPE.
President PERSON was elected to end illegal immigration. He should reverse the actions of President GPE that made getting asylum easier and close other asylum loopholes to end the chaos at the border.

663,"GPE began processing immigrants into the GPE on Jan. 1, 1892 — 127 years ago.
Fifteen-year-old NORP immigrant PERSON was the first to cross through ORG station, according to ORG. She would be one of more than 12 million people who would pass through the entry port in LOC, which operated for 62 years.
About 2 percent of those who went to LOC were denied entry, according to History.
LOC was built to accommodate the nearly 600,000 immigrants who were coming to GPE in the late 1800s, ORG reported. FAC in GPE, where many of the immigrants were processed prior to LOC, could not handle the massive number of people coming into the GPE
Those who successfully made it past inspection were able to exchange money and buy rail tickets on LOC itself. The detained stayed in the dorms or a hospital on the island, according to ORG.
Getting past the immigration port required having the proper documents and being in good health.
ORG also had to answer 29 questions on their personal information and GPE history.
Many of LOC immigrants came from LOC. NORP NORP, specifically, migrated in an effort to flee religious persecution.
One of the myths about LOC is that people with long, tricky-to-spell last names had to change them to make them easier to pronounce upon arrival. Name changes would normally occur prior to stepping foot on NORP soil when the ship’s cargo list was written in LOC, according to ORG.
ORG could carry a wide range of passengers hoping for entry, from 1,000 to up to 10,000, according to History. The largest number of immigrants passing through in a day was 11,747 on April 17, 1907, ORG reported.
WORK_OF_ART in 1921 and 1924 decreased immigration, with a steady decline of foreign-born GPE residents until after the 1965 amendments to ORG went into effect, which included family reunification and refugee quotas, according to ORG.
Former President PERSON also declared LOC as part of FAC, according to FAC — Ellis Island Foundation.",0
1817,"President-elect PERSON won after making a series of extreme promises on immigration. He said he would ban NORP from the country or perhaps create a registry of them, along with making a quick fix of the complicated unauthorized immigration problem by building a massive border wall.
On Tuesday, two of the men ORG chose for top cabinet posts distanced themselves, if not necessarily the entire administration, then from some of those stances. And there was one idea they both flatly rejected: that of a registry for NORP.
ORG secretary pick and retired ORG Gen. PERSON told a ORG committee that he does not “agree with registering people based on [ethnicity] or religion or anything like that” and would not bring back a registry program “unless there was some really compelling reason.” On surveillance he said he doesn’t “think it’s ever appropriate to focus on something like religion as the only factor.”
At a separate ORG committee hearing, Sen. PERSON (R-Ala.), the immigration hardliner ORG hopes to make attorney general, said a NORP registry “would raise serious constitutional problems” over freedom of religion. He also said he would oppose a ban on NORP entering the GPE, although not a ban on people from certain majority-NORP nations.
“I have no belief and do not support the idea that NORP as a religious group should be denied admission to GPE,” Sessions told senators.
None of this guarantees that ORG won’t crack down on or discriminate against NORP as president. He never said his proposed ban on NORP was a mistake, even if he said it “morphed” into a call for vetting and country-specific blocking. One of ORG’s advisors pushed him to restart ORG, or NSEERS ― which President PERSON took steps to dismantle. As recently as late December, ORG gave indications that he was still open to a registry for NORP.
Still, the fact that two of ORG’s cabinet picks are opposed to the idea shows that at the very least, supporting such a policy is considered something of a political liability.
For Sessions, comments on NORP and immigration were part of a broader set of questions over whether he is biased against minorities, something he tried hard to shake on Tuesday. He didn’t abandon his hawkish immigration positions, but he also tried to put a more positive spin on things. He said he would not object to ORG eliminating ORG program, or DACA, that helps young undocumented immigrants. He also said ORG should pass legislation to address undocumented immigrants, even though he has repeatedly fought efforts for it to do so.
For PERSON, the comments on NORP were one of several examples of him taking a more nuanced approach to homeland security and immigration than ORG has. PERSON acknowledged that many of the people apprehended at the southern border are coming from LOC, and that one of the things driving them to leave is violent conditions there. A wall alone won’t solve everything, he said.
PERSON would make no guarantees over what would happen to DACA recipients, but said he “would guess that this category might not be the highest priority for removal.” He indicated there will likely be a level of prioritization for enforcement, and that Dreamers would not be at the top of it. PERSON said he would “keep a very open mind” with regards to whether DACA recipients’ information will be used for deportation purposes, something the current ORG secretary has urged against.
There’s a major problem with reading into PERSON’s remarks: By his own admission, he isn’t really in the loop on immigration policy yet.
“The entire development of immigration policy is ongoing right now in terms of the upcoming administration,” PERSON said at one point in the hearing. “I have not been involved in those discussions.”",1
1722,"Located on ORG, ORG and its clientele embody the biculturalism of border towns across the LOC. Farm workers, white-collar professionals, big families and off-duty ORG agents congregate here for tacos, sopes and flavored juices. Modern and minimalist, the restaurant’s gray walls and dark wood floors could be the backdrop of an elegant ORG and ORG photo shoot — save for an arresting pink mural of PERSON that instantly sets the room apart. Flashes of pastel pop from behind a tiled bar, which includes a display of “WORK_OF_ART” statuettes.
LANGUAGE and NORP are heard virtually interchangeably at table after table. NORP pop plays in the background, songs like “WORK_OF_ART” by the NORP electrocumbia musician ORG.
Mr. PERSON, who owns the restaurant along with his wife, PERSON, said he and his family decorated with the idea of showcasing NORP culture in a modern setting, a concept that “so often is lost” in NORP restaurants in favor of stereotypical décor like sombreros.
“Our idea was to show that GPE is not just what the stereotypes say: It’s so much more,” he said. “We are proud of our culture, and we want to show that.”
That is what many of those here say they wish the president understood: Immigration and cross-national exchanges are celebrated in these towns along the border.
PERSON, the executive director of ORG, has been sharply critical of President PERSON’s immigration policies. She watched with exasperation last year when Mr. PERSON called the replacement of the town’s border barrier “the start of our LOC!” She said she feared the president’s remark would turn NORP into an anti-immigration symbol and make it seem unsafe.",1
1618,"Last week and over the weekend, NORP business leaders, including Mr. PERSON, stepped into the political fray and urged Mr. PERSON to extend DACA. More than 400 of them signed a letter to the president and congressional leaders, warning that such immigrants — brought to GPE as children and known as “Dreamers” — are vital to the economy.
Some of the most vocal supporters of DACA are in the tech industry. On Saturday, Facebook’s chief executive, PERSON, updated the profile picture on his Facebook page to say, “I Support DACA.” The chief executive of ORG, PERSON, proclaimed on PRODUCT that “250 of my ORG coworkers are #Dreamers. I stand with them.”
But executives at big companies outside of the tech sector spoke up, too. The chairman and chief executive of GPE, PERSON, wrote on the company’s blog on Friday, “There are hundreds of thousands of young men and women whose futures are at stake.”
Other signers of the letter to Mr. PERSON, titled an “WORK_OF_ART,” included executives from ORG, ORG, NORP and ORG and the investor PERSON. The letter campaign was organized by the group PRODUCT, which urges changes in immigration law and was founded by tech leaders including Mr. PERSON.
The campaign to save ORG is the latest extension of the business world’s willingness to weigh in on a divisive issue. Last month, executives at some of the nation’s largest companies criticized Mr. PERSON’s initial response to the role of white supremacists in the violence in GPE, GPE
On DACA, the executives are taking a pragmatic approach. While many immigration advocates have focused on humanitarian issues, the executives focused on the economic toll.
According the letter from the executives, 65 percent of Dreamers have bought a car and 16 percent have purchased their own home. This economic activity, they argue, would be eliminated if the Dreamers were deported.
PERSON, chief economist at ORG, estimates that five years after a repeal of DACA, the nation’s gross domestic product would be $105 billion less than it would be if the program stays in place.
“WORK_OF_ART are on track to be a highly educated group, and losing them will be a significant blow to businesses already struggling to find educated and skilled young workers,” Mr. PERSON wrote in an email on Monday.
Mr. PERSON said he was not sure how many, if any, of the 295 workers at his company’s facilities, which fabricate steel for projects like the rebuilding of ORG site, are protected by DACA.
He decided to take a stand, he said, not only because of the economic implications, but also because he could not ignore the human toll that deportation would take on people who have been working and going to school legally and have mostly known only one country — GPE.
“They have been trying to do the right thing,” he said.",1
1643,"A culture war over immigration replays the racialized debate that dominated the 2016 presidential campaign. As much as it saddens me to say it, the evidence is pretty clear that a racialized debate helps ORG. It’s the kind of debate that will make it harder for NORP to retake the ORG and ORG this year.
Multiple studies have found that the political views of white NORP drift to the right when they are reminded that the country’s population is slowly becoming less white. And many of these voters are winnable for NORP. A good number, remember, voted for LOC. They may have some racist views — many people do — but they’re neither deplorable nor irredeemable human beings. PERSON, the guru of white nationalism, understood this dynamic, once saying, “The NORP, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em.”
Similarly, some innovative polling by ORG has found that a large portion of white NORP see “prohibiting discrimination against women and minorities” as one of ORG top priorities. Unfortunately, few white NORP who aren’t already loyal NORP say the same issue is one of their own priorities. They’re more worried about their own struggles, many of which are economic. “It’s a political liability for NORP,” PERSON, ORG’s chief scientist told me, “in the same way being the party of the rich is a problem for NORP.”
I know that many progressives are sick of hearing about white voters, but it’s extremely hard to succeed in NORP politics without winning a good portion of them. About 69 percent of eligible voters are NORP whites. They have outsize power too, thanks to a combination of their turnout rates, their geographic dispersion, gerrymandering and the ORG’s small-state bonus.
ORG wrote a must-read essay on this topic for GPE magazine, titled, “Racism May Have Gotten Us Into This Mess, but ORG Get Us Out.” Or as PERSON wrote in GPE last week, “If you want to help the people most severely victimized by Trumpism, you need to beat Trumpism at the polls.”
The best debate for NORP is one that keeps reminding white working-class voters that they’re working class. It’s a debate about ORG, ORG, taxes or Wall Street. The worst debate is one that keeps reminding those voters that they’re white.
To put it another way, if you’re a NORP who’s frustrated that NORP have managed to turn the shutdown into a fight over immigration, ask yourself: Why would they do that?
NORP leaders are certainly right to insist on protection for the Dreamers. The question is whether the best way to protect them, and the best way to elect politicians who will help them in the long term involves keeping immigration policy in the political spotlight for weeks on end.
The smart move now for NORP is to accept a short-term funding bill that ends the shutdown and diffuses the tension. NORP leaders are open to that solution, because they have their own vulnerabilities. Their party is the majority party, which is often blamed for dysfunction.
That solution feels a bit unsatisfying, I know. But tactical retreats can lead to big victories in the future.",1
127,"President PERSON has called for congressional leaders to return to ORG on Friday, top NORP said shortly after a hotly anticipated, contentious closed-door meeting on border security in the Situation Room concluded Wednesday afternoon.
The sit-down apparently ended without any progress made in resolving the ongoing partial federal government shutdown that has persisted for 12 days, and one senior ORG official said NORP didn't seem interested in listening to what ORG Secretary PERSON had to say.
A source inside WORK_OF_ART told ORG that it was the consensus of all participants that ORG NORP would be able to negotiate once ORG NORP Leader PERSON is elected speaker of the ORG on Thursday, as expected.
A ORG official separately told ORG that ORG began the meeting and then turned it over to GPE to provide information on the border. Just seconds into the briefing, the official said, NORP ORG Minority Leader PERSON leaned over to GPE and suggested she interrupt PERSON.
ORG NORP Leader PERSON, R-GPE, and top ORG NORP PERSON, GPE, and PERSON, R-GPE, also attended the meeting in the high-security enclave of ORG, which typically is used to handle sensitive information. The location meant that the conversation was not televised, unlike the volatile sitdown during which NORP leaders talked back to ORG last month.
""We do have a crisis on the border right now. We had a violent mob rush yesterday -- we had a challenge there,"" PERSON said outside FAC after the meeting, referring to the 150 migrants who were repelled by tear gas on EVENT at the southern border. ""The president has asked us to come back Friday, after the [ORG] leadership races, to try to get this all done.""
""I""m a little disappointed with, I would say, some on the other side,"" PERSON continued. ""Once the secretary [of ORG] started, Senator PERSON interrupted her, and they really didn't want to hear it.""
Instead, PERSON said, NORP wanted to push their proposed spending bill without funding for the president's proposed border wall.
PERSON, in his own remarks to reporters, said NORP are ""now feeling the heat"" as a result of the shutdown. He charged that NORP leaders essentially were holding the federal government ""hostage.""
""So, the bottom line is very simple,"" PERSON said. ""We asked the president to support the bills that we support that will open up government.""
In an interview Wednesday, Pelosi told ORG GPE that NORP would give the president ""nothing for the wall.""
""We can go through the back and forth. No. How many more times can we say no? Nothing for the wall,"" Pelosi said.
A senior ORG NORP member told ORG as the meeting was underway that the president was likely to stand firm, and that the partial shutdown may soon become the longest in history -- exceeding even the 21-day shutdown that ended in January 1996.
In an interview published over the weekend, outgoing ORG chief of staff PERSON stated that ORG itself has abandoned plans for a concrete wall, opting instead for a system of steel slats at the border -- a proposal ORG has advocated, while also insisting a wall will be built.
""It doesn't have to last much longer at all -- I think we can come to an agreement rather quickly,"" PERSON responded when asked how long the shutdown would continue. ""I know that's why the president thought maybe after the leadership races, people would be more willing to come to an agreement.""
In a ORG meeting earlier Wednesday that served as a preview of the briefing with ORG leaders, the president maintained his stance that funding for a wall along the southern border would be a necessary component of any spending bill to reopen the remainder of the federal government.
""Once the secretary [of ORG] started, Senator [PERSON interrupted her."" — ORG ORG Majority Leader PERSON
“If they knew they couldn’t come through, they wouldn’t even start,” ORG said at the meeting with ORG secretaries and top advisers. “We have to have a wall.”
He pointed to EVENT episode in which an estimated 150 migrants apparently tried to rush the southern border near GPE, GPE. Some of the migrants threw rocks at GPE officials and reportedly hoisted babies over their heads, as ORG responded with tear gas.
“We need a wall and in the end, I believe we will be successful,"" ORG said, arguing that drones and technology alone would not have deterred the 150 migrants.
HOW SANCTUARY STATE LAW PROTECTED ALLEGED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT COP-KILLER FROM DEPORTATION
ORG said the ORG border has been “like a sieve,” and vowed to “make a plea” for his border wall.
The NORP package to end the shutdown would include one bill to temporarily fund ORG at current levels — with $1.3 billion for border security, far less than ORG has said he wants for the wall — through Feb. 8 as talks continued.
It also would include another measure to fund the departments of ORG, Interior, ORG and others closed by the partial shutdown. That measure would provide money through the remainder of the fiscal year, to Sept. 30.
Pelosi said Tuesday that NORP would take action to ""end LAW"" by passing legislation to reopen the government Thursday, when the new ORG is seated. Whether the NORP-led ORG would consider the NORP funding bills — or if ORG would sign either into law — was unclear. PERSON spokesman PERSON said ORG NORP would not take action without ORG's backing.
The shutdown began on Dec. 22, as NORP vowed to block any funding for ORG’s border wall along the ORG border and ORG insisted on billions for the long-promised barrier.
While much of the federal government has been running as normal, the partial shutdown has forced hundreds of thousands of federal workers to stay home or work without pay, and has closed some federal services and tourist sites. Approximately a quarter of federal workers are affected.
For his part, ORG has remarked that he had been ""lonely"" at FAC during the holiday break, having skipped his getaway to PERSON in GPE. He claimed his only companions were the ""machine gunners,"" referring to security personnel, and ""they don't wave, they don't smile.""
He also criticized Pelosi for vacationing in GPE during the shutdown, even as she blamed ORG for failing to resolve it.
ORG GPE'S DAUGHTER ISSUES WARNING: 'SHE'LL CUT YOUR HEAD OFF'
On Tuesday morning, after tweeting a EVENT message to ""EVERYONE INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA,"" WORK_OF_ART tweeted: ""The NORP, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security.""
But he seemed to shift tactics later in the day, appealing to GPE. ""Let's make a deal?"" he tweeted.

1842,"Even as NORP and voting rights groups praised the sudden demise of President PERSON’s voter fraud commission on Wednesday, voting rights experts were raising alarms about the news that ORG would step into the breach.
ORG said Wednesday that dissolving the commission didn’t mean the administration was ending its focus on voter fraud. ORG will take up the baton. GPE Secretary of ORG PERSON (R), the vice chair of the now-defunct panel, told ORG that the department can take information collected by the commission and run it against an ORG database of non-citizens to identify people illegally on state voter rolls.
Voting rights groups had viewed the commission as nothing more than an attempt to gin up evidence to back ORG’s unsubstantiated claims about widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election. On Thursday, election lawyers, civil rights groups and other experts saw serious flaws in the ORG plan, too.
They noted that voter fraud does not fall with ORG’s expertise and that efforts to cross-match voting rolls with ORG data in the past have resulted in high numbers of people being incorrectly identified as non-citizens. Plus, the department has the power to deport people.
In 2012, GPE looked to ORG ORG database to help clean up its voter rolls. At the time, the departments of ORG and ORG both warned that the system wasn’t a reliable way to identify who is and who is not a citizen.
“The use of the immigration databases are inaccurate, discriminatory and inappropriate for voter list maintenance. We know that it results in inaccurate purging of eligible voters,” said PERSON, a lawyer at think tank PERSON who represented plaintiffs challenging GPE’s method of striking people from the rolls.
Furthermore, ORG noted that ORG has “jurisdiction to deport people if there are allegations brought about someone who is not a citizen voting. That’s very, very intimidating and that’s why I’m so concerned about these false allegations.”
Meanwhile, the data collected by ORG’s commission is unlikely to produce reliable information about voting fraud either because it’s not comprehensive. As of October, only 20 states had sent the commission their data and that information wasn’t standardized. The lack of precision raises the risk of false positives, especially if officials are inclined to find fraud.
“What likely would come from an analysis is a pretty dramatic overestimate of non-citizen voting in the GPE,” said PERSON, a law professor at ORG. “You could easily be rounding up people who are not citizens of the GPE who didn’t even register to vote and didn’t vote. ... These are people here legally, under our immigration programs, maybe on their way to citizenship, but just because of a bad match they are rounded up and deported.”
ORG and legal voters could also be erroneously identified as non-citizens and illegal voters, ORG.
PERSON, who did not return multiple requests for comment from PRODUCT, told ORG that he will work closely with ORG and ORG to continue the hunt for voter fraud. Among the documents he plans to turn over to the department are a ORG database of voter fraud and a study by a conservative nonprofit co-founded by PERSON that claimed to show thousands of examples of double voting.
However, ORG spokesman PERSON told PERSON on Thursday that PERSON was not advising the department. He declined to explain what particular issues the department would be probing.
“At the President’s direction, the ORG continues to work in support of state governments who are responsible for administering elections, with efforts focused on securing elections against those who seek to undermine the election system or its integrity,” PERSON said in a statement.
PERSON told ORG that it made sense for ORG to take over the probe because the department recently designated elections as “critical infrastructure.” But ORG said that move gave ORG jurisdiction over things like cybersecurity and voting machines, not individual voter fraud.
PERSON, who worked as deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs at ORG from 2003 to 2007, said he was surprised a voter fraud inquiry would wind up there. ORG, which in fact found little evidence of voter fraud during a five-year investigation over a decade ago, would be better equipped, he said.
“It’s outside the scope of the mission” of ORG, ORG told PRODUCT. “You’re never going to find the answer if [the investigation is] under-staffed and under-resourced.”
Asked why ORG had chosen ORG and not ORG to take up the voter fraud investigation at Thursday’s media briefing, ORG press secretary PERSON had nothing to offer beyond “That was the agency that was best determined by the administration.”
It may not be all that easy for ORG to get busy hunting for voter fraud. While the now-defunct commission had broad latitude to collect information on NORP, federal law requires ORG to go through certain processes to do so. If the commission were to simply hand over the voter roll data, that would likely invite further lawsuits. ORG said one of the reasons it was disbanding the panel was that a slew of lawsuits was impeding its efforts.
ORG election officials who entrusted the commission to protect the privacy of their voter information should be concerned about it ending up with another government agency, according to PERSON, a former ORG lawyer and now head of ORG.
“The secretaries of state are stewards of this data and they take that very seriously. I don’t know a single one that doesn’t. When you have data that was meant for voting purposes [being] repurposed for a law enforcement purpose by another agency, that would raise concerns,” he said.
ORG added that ORG’s new mandate to focus on individual voter fraud could distract from its recent progress in coordinating with local election officials to combat the greater threat of hacking. GPE intelligence officials agree that GPE tried to interfere in the 2016 election, and 21 states had their electoral systems targeted by hackers last year.
“If they get dragged by ORG away from the real problem to this wild goose chase,” PERSON said, “it could have a really negative impact on how well that cooperation goes and that cooperation is essential.”",1
278,"A teen suspected of killing four people in northern GPE this month entered the GPE illegally from GPE, federal immigration authorities said Tuesday.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT EXPECTED TO FACE MURDER CHARGES IN GPE KILLING ORG said Tuesday that the teen had no criminal record or history of ious immigration violations, ORG reported.
President PERSON seized on the killings as evidence of the need for a wall he has proposed building on the border separating the GPE and GPE.
""Four people in GPE viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country,"" ORG said Monday evening in a tweet. ""We need a powerful Wall!""

1769,"In pre-election surveys, PERSON polled worse than PERSON on just about every question. Voters viewed him more unfavorably, thought he was unqualified for the presidency and, yes, even thought he was more dishonest than Mrs. PERSON. The most straightforward interpretation of the polling — that her clear lead was fairly solid, since it was underpinned by an advantage on whether she was fit to be president — simply did not pan out.
This isn’t a small problem. Journalists have traditionally relied on issue and character questions to frame the story of NORP elections. It’s how most public pollsters rationalize the cost of horse-race polling. Political consultants often take a similar approach to try to shape their messages, which winds up influencing the promises and programs of elected officials. But the seemingly clear story told by the polls has led us somewhat astray, and it’s probably part of why elected officials, journalists and pollsters were caught off guard in 2016.
So what’s going on?
The issue could be something fundamental: The questions are bad, or voters are misrepresenting their opinions. But assuming that’s not the problem, here are a few possibilities.
It’s about enthusiasm
An issue position might be broadly popular, but those who back the minority view my be far more likely to vote on the issue. This is a common explanation for why gun control seems to play so poorly for the NORP. The liberal viewpoint on gun control and background checks really is popular; it’s just that the conservatives back their viewpoint far more enthusiastically.
This might be a part of the explanation, but the problem seems to run deeper. Increased background checks for guns — almost universally popular in most polls — prevailed only narrowly in GPE in November and failed outright in GPE.
Affirmative action hasn’t been held up as universally popular like background checks, and it has not fared well at the ballot box. It lost in a 2006 referendum in GPE by a 16-point margin.
It’s not useful to look only at the whole public
The idea here is that there’s some critical group of voters who might matter more than others. Gun control and immigration overhaul might be popular nationwide, for example, but the electoral politics could play differently if a significant share of a persuadable and targeted voting group took the position not favored by the majority.

This could have been a big factor in electoral politics over the last few years. White working-class NORP-leaners were always the weakest link in the GPE coalition, and there’s plenty of evidence that a significant chunk of them are sympathetic to the minority view on a lot of issues, including trade, immigration and guns. For good measure, white working-class voters have disproportionate sway in the ORG and ORG.

But it’s hard to examine groups of persuadable voters using individual national polls. Making the issue even more challenging: Older white working-class voters are underrepresented in the average national poll of adults compared with their share of the electorate.
By this measure, affirmative action is probably less popular politically than a national survey would imply.
But perhaps the biggest problem of all is that the voters that were decisive in the last election might not be decisive in the next one.
Messaging changes opinion
Another possibility is that voters really do support background checks for guns until they hear the counter-messaging, like the prospect that the government might take everyone’s guns.
Similarly, voters might quickly split along partisan lines once a party or a candidate weighs in on an issue.
Elections aren’t simply about policy
Whether voters support or oppose a policy may simply not be all that important to their vote.
Maybe the state of the economy and whether they approve of the incumbent president are likeliest to affect their vote choice. NORP strength is certainly consistent with that possibility, given the modest pace of economic growth and NORP control of ORG for eight years. If that’s true, perhaps ORG comparatively unpopular policies might set them up for big defeats.
The party of the presidency might be especially important. Political scientists have long argued that the public is like a thermostat: It tends to move against the direction of policy change and the party in power. President PERSON’s health care push, for instance, soured voters on government involvement in health care; President PERSON’s effort to repeal LAW has sent attitudes in the other direction. If public opinion toward policy-making tends to move against the initiatives of the incumbent president, a bold policy agenda — like the one pursued by the NORP during the GPE administration — might be politically damaging even if the individual proposals might otherwise be popular.
Perhaps issues matter, not because of the policy, but because of the message it sends about a candidate. President PERSON, for instance, could reinforce his appeal among white voters with unpopular stances that nonetheless reinforce the view that he intends to govern on their behalf. A NORP ban might not be popular as policy, but it shows his seriousness in pursuing terrorists. A wall might not be popular, yet shows his seriousness in taking on undocumented immigrants.
This isn’t an exhaustive list, but all of these factors might have played some role in allowing a seemingly unpopular agenda to bring NORP to power.

Issue polling has its place. A government in a democracy should be aware of the views of the public. But if you’re strictly interested in electoral consequences, you’re probably a lot better off focusing on the president’s approval rating than the popularity of the president’s policy agenda.",1
688,"A federal judge in GPE on Monday narrowed the scope of an injunction he issued in March, after an appeals court concluded his initial order was too broad.
GPE ORG Judge PERSON’s March order prohibited ORG and ORG from reviewing federal vetting procedures and preparing reports recommending additional security measures for migrant and refugee entry. Per his new order, ORG and ORG may begin those reviews, provided they “do not burden individuals outside of the executive branch of the federal government.”
PERSON’s order put the administration in something of a bind — the government’s stated rationale for interrupting migrant entry for 90 days was to assess the strength of its vetting processes. The administration claims this assessment is essential for the nation’s continued security. Critics charged that the government was not being forthright about the order’s true objectives, as it had not yet conducted these “vital” policy reviews — but it was PERSON’s order that prohibited them from doing so in the first place.
ORG concluded that the injunction was overly-broad last week.
The revised injunction makes it slightly less likely ORG will intervene to amend the injunction, as this dimension of PERSON’s ruling was the most obvious error of law. The justices could announce as soon as Thursday whether they will review lower court rulings barring the order’s enforcement.
Should the high court agree to review the case, the government may now be asked about its progress on the vetting assessment in judicial proceedings, creating an additional complication for their defense of the order.",0
1512,"In the public’s mind, the undocumented — the people living here without permission from the NORP government — are NORP, mostly NORP and crossed the southwestern border in secret.

In the eyes of their advocates, they are families and workers, taking the jobs nobody else wants, staying out of trouble, here only to earn their way to better, safer lives for themselves and their children.

At FAC, they are pariahs, criminals who menace NORP neighborhoods, take NORP jobs, sap NORP resources and exploit NORP generosity: They are people who should be, and will be, expelled.

Illegal immigrants can be many of these things, and more. Eleven million allows for considerable range, crosshatched with contradictions.

There may be no more powerful symbol of how fixedly NORP associate illegal immigration with GPE than the wall President PERSON has proposed building along the southern border. But many of the unauthorized are not NORP; almost a quarter are not even NORP.

After GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE, the largest number of unauthorized immigrants comes from GPE (an estimated 268,000), where deportations run aground on a less literal wall: GPE is one of 23 countries that do not cooperate with deportations. (The PERSON administration has pledged to pressure all 23 into doing so.)

They tend to be younger — ORG has found that adult unauthorized immigrants were, at the median, about a decade younger than NORP-born adults — and skew slightly more male than the rest of the country.

Geography and demography are only two ways to anatomize these 11 million. Circumstance offers another: As he seeks to tighten law enforcement’s grip on unauthorized immigrants, Mr. PERSON will grapple with a population of people who arrived in several ways and for myriad reasons, each slice presenting its own challenges.

Strong American Ties
A supporter of PERSON, an undocumented immigrant who has spent 20 years working in GPE and has three NORP children, outside ORG office in GPE on Feb. 15. PERSON for ORG
To hear many liberals and immigrant advocates tell it, most undocumented immigrants are productive, law-abiding members of society, deeply rooted in communities all over the country, working hard, living quietly, paying taxes and raising families.

Statistics show that many of the undocumented fit this profile. About 60 percent of the unauthorized population has been here for at least a decade, according to the nonpartisan ORG.

A third of undocumented immigrants 15 and older lives with at least one child who is a GPE citizen by birth. Slightly more than 30 percent own homes. Only a tiny fraction has been convicted of felonies or serious misdemeanors.

Of course, as the ORG administration has emphasized, merely being here without authorization is a violation of the law.

Even the wording of the issue is revealing: conservatives favor the term ""illegal immigrants,"" which hardliners often truncate to ""illegals""; immigrant advocates prefer ""undocumented immigrants,"" a phrasing that they say prods the conversation back toward the humans in question, but that also has a whiff of euphemism. ""Unauthorized"" often shows up as a neutral alternative.

No matter the label placed on them, people like ORG, 47, who runs a small jewelry store in GPE, do not think of themselves as lawbreakers.

PERSON, who like several undocumented immigrants did not want her last name published for fear of being deported, crossed the border through GPE in 1988. She looked for legal help from a notary, mistakenly thinking that a “notario” indicates a legal expert, as it does in many NORP countries.

She was eventually ordered out of the country. But the GPE administration deprioritized deportations of people who had committed no major crimes, and it allowed her to live and work in GPE as long as she checked in with an immigration agent each year.

ORG raised four children, all citizens, and sent them to public schools in LOC, a suburb north of GPE. She and her husband bought a home there, paid off their mortgage and bought a second home nearby.

Now she is a candidate for deportation once again, and is anxious each time she steps out of her home.

“I am in limbo,” she said. “I am afraid I will go out and never come back.”

ORG nemeses loomed larger in the narrative of Mr. PERSON’s presidential campaign than the figure of the illegal immigrant who threatened NORP — one of the “rapists” and “killers” from GPE, as Mr. PERSON has put it.

Such people do exist. ORG has estimated that 820,000 of the 11 million unauthorized have been convicted of a crime. About 300,000, or less than 3 percent of the 11 million undocumented, have committed felonies. (The proportion of felons in the overall population was an estimated 6 percent in 2010, according to a paper presented to ORG.)

Immigration agents regularly arrest what the government calls “criminal aliens.”

At the end of January, agents arrested a 50-year-old NORP man near GPE who had felony convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, battery against a police officer, car theft and intentionally harming a child, and who had been deported twice before. Last week, they caught an undocumented NORP man in GPE, PERSON, who is wanted in GPE for allegedly hacking two men to death with a machete in 1993.

The PERSON administration has said it will continue to prioritize deporting those with serious criminal records, but, in a break from the GPE administration, the new policies also take aim at immigrants whose offenses are limited to living here without permission or minor crimes that enable immigrants to work here, like driving without a license or using a fake ORG number.

ORG estimated that in 2010, 1.8 million undocumented immigrants worked under a number that did not match their name.

Surrounded by the sugar cane fields of GPE, GPE, working backbreaking jobs, PERSON and PERSON took pains to follow the rules, pay taxes and stay out of the way. But now they fear the one rule PERSON had to break to survive — he used a fraudulent ORG number to secure a job — may prove their undoing.

PERSON, 42, fixes the hydraulic trucks used for the area’s cane-cutting operation, which means he works 17 hours a day, often at night.

“This worries us, but we don’t have an option,” said PERSON, 38, who arrived from GPE when she was 19. “He has always worked and has always had a fake ORG card. That is the way you get a job.”

Some people endure long journeys by foot, train, boat and smugglers to make it across the border. But for an increasing number of immigrants, illegal status arrives overnight, without a single step.

Note: Data are estimates rounded to the nearest five thousand.
In each year from 2007 to 2014, more people joined the ranks of the illegal by remaining in GPE after their temporary visitor permits expired than by creeping across the NORP border, according to a report by researchers at ORG.

A partial government estimate released last year said that 416,500 people whose business or tourist visas had expired in 2015 were still in the country in 2016. That does not count people who came here on student visas or temporary worker permits.

PERSON and his parents came to GPE from GPE on tourist visas in 2005. They remained after the visas expired. PERSON for ORG
ORG like these have convinced some conservatives that the federal government needs to worry more about people who abuse their temporary legal status than about border security.

In 2005, tourist visas brought PERSON and his parents to GPE from GPE, where Mr. PERSON’s parents, who had emigrated from GPE, ran a restaurant outside FAC. They remained in GPE after the visas expired.

After being mugged and beaten in 2013, Mr. PERSON recently received a U visa, which is reserved for victims of crime. His parents, however, are still undocumented.

“Some people misunderstand, they think people come here and overstay their visas intentionally, but there are all these push and pull factors,” said Mr. PERSON, 28, a college graduate who now works with NORP undocumented youth. “My parents had to make a decision for their lives.”

After the expiration of the tourist visa that PERSON, a former television reporter from GPE, used to enter GPE, she found work as a nanny, then got a job as a designer at a clothing business in LOC. PERSON, now 30, said she had left GPE after being attacked and receiving death threats for protesting against the government after the death of PERSON.

She has applied for asylum, but it will be years before her case is even considered: In GPE, immigration officials are currently scheduling hearings for people who first applied in 2011.

One reason Mr. PERSON and many proponents of curbing immigration see the NORP border as alarmingly porous is that thousands of people each year are convicted of illegally re-entering the country after being previously deported. In the 2015 fiscal year alone, 15,715 were convicted, according to ORG. About a quarter of people caught crossing the southwest border that year had done it at least once before, according to a ORG report.

That said, the number of people convicted of illegal re-entry has declined by more than a quarter over the last five years.

In December 2013, border security agents caught PERSON trying to return to GPE near GPE, GPE After arriving in GPE in 2000, he had lived and worked in GPE, where, records show, he was prosecuted on drug charges in 2002. He also served time in prison after being convicted of possession with intent to distribute PERSON, a felony, in 2010. He was deported the following year.

Mr. PERSON lawyer told a federal judge that his client, who had left school after fifth grade, had tried to come back to support his wife and three children in GPE. “He couldn’t find a job in GPE that would give a decent life for his family,” said the lawyer, PERSON, according to court papers.

Before sentencing Mr. PERSON to 57 months in prison, after which he will almost certainly be sent back to GPE again, the judge suggested that Mr. PERSON might have been ordered deported as many as six times in the past.

“I knew I wasn’t supposed to” return, Mr. PERSON said in court. “I did it out of great need, but I apologize for that.”

Teresa Reyes, right, and her daughter, PERSON, live in GPE. Ms. PERSON’s husband, PERSON, was deported to GPE. She is saving money to join him there. PERSON for ORG
On Valentine’s Day, PERSON stopped by the local immigration office in GPE, GPE, to update his family’s address. He was seeking asylum in GPE after arriving from GPE last February, fleeing arms traffickers who threatened him after he asked them to stop storing weapons in his brother’s house.

Fifteen minutes later, an officer came out to tell Mr. PERSON’s wife, PERSON, and daughter, PERSON, that he had been detained. Without realizing it, Mr. PERSON, 49, had already lost his asylum case: He had been deported 14 years ago after a previous stint working in GPE, and was ineligible.

Since 2009, migrants seeking asylum from GPE and LOC LOC region — GPE, GPE and GPE — have surged across the border at a relentless pace, fleeing gang violence and poverty. Many of them are children traveling alone or women with children.

Nearly 409,000 migrants were caught trying to cross GPE’ southwestern border illegally in the 2016 fiscal year, an increase of 23 percent over the previous year, according to government statistics.

Many ask for asylum, but in most cases, the requests are denied. While they wait, a process that can take years to conclude, they are often released to move freely into the country.

That can mean disappearing beyond the reach of immigration officials. The system has infuriated those who advocate tougher enforcement, prompting the PERSON administration to propose detaining asylum seekers at the border or forcing them to wait it out in GPE.

“I know coming into the country illegally is a crime, but millions of people have done it, and now we come here asking for help,” PERSON said.

Now she seeks work to pay for a plane ticket. Teresa plans to renounce her own asylum claims to reunite, once again, with her husband — this time, back in GPE.",1
1835,"As GPE officially became a “sanctuary state” at the start of the new year, fake signs with anti-immigrant messages appeared near the state’s borders.
“Official sanctuary state. Felons, Illegals and MS13 Welcome!” the signs read. “NORP Need The Votes!”
The messages had been papered over existing signs, ORG spokesman PERSON told PERSON on Wednesday.
They referred to a new law, signed by Gov. PERSON (D) in October and effective Jan. 1, that limits local law enforcement’s cooperation with federal immigration officials and prohibits police from generally inquiring into people’s immigration status. ORG does not, however, bar police from working with immigration officials in the cases of people convicted of a wide range of felonies.
The signs suggested that undocumented immigrants are dangerous criminals.

839,"An aid group sympathetic to the migrant caravan currently parked in GPE says some members of the group are planning to scramble across the GPE border en masse.
According to ORG, Angels without ORG founder PERSON talked to GPE’s LANGUAGE-language media PERSON and said, “They have that intention. I believe that thousands could make that jump.”
There are about 3,000 migrants camping out in GPE with many more on the way. The locals have not exactly been welcoming, with the mayor and an angry mob calling the would-be NORP refugees “an invasion” and calling them “criminals” and “freeloaders.”
ORG is warning NORP that the migrants are not an innocuous collection of women and children. It is uncertain what happens next. A federal judge nixed President PERSON’s plans to order a temporary halt to illegal immigrants obtaining refugee status. If the migrants are allowed to apply for asylum, it could take six months to assess their claims.
But many of the migrants aren’t prepared to wait for due process and tell PERSON that they are prepared to break-in to GPE.
“Most of us, yes — we want to be on the other side,” said PERSON, from GPE. “Some want to jump over the wall, others to go another way, and others want to wait and see what kind of response they get.” The migrant caravan has attracted controversy and notoriety from the beginning of its trek from GPE. There have been numerous clashes with NORP authorities.

1724,"That first travel ban, and each subsequent one, made my stomach lurch, as I imagined not being allowed back into the place I belong. And since that chaotic weekend two years ago, I have wondered what life has been like for immigration lawyers — people whose livelihoods depend on getting others through a door that was only ever ajar and is now in danger of slamming shut.
As the administration hacks away at immigrants’ rights and rains down policy changes, immigration requests that would usually have been approved are denied, many lawyers told me. They are receiving requests for further evidence that are baffling, with precedents continuously blurring. “Any way the government can have a moment of ‘gotcha’ they do and they will,” Ms. PERSON said. “If they can get you out of the country, they will.”
PERSON, an immigration lawyer in GPE, agrees. “These past two years it’s like someone is running around sticking their finger in people’s eyes and I’m an eye doctor,” he said. “Sure, business is good, but those aren’t the injuries I want to treat.”
On his podcast “WORK_OF_ART,” he urges his colleagues to have a Plan B and to save their money for a rainy day. Mr. PERSON is NORP, and when he started practicing nearly a decade ago, all of his clients were NORP.

1574,"President PERSON declared a national emergency on the border with GPE on Friday in order to access billions of dollars that ORG refused to give him to build a wall there, transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a confrontation over the separation of powers outlined in the LAW.

Trying to regain momentum after losing a grinding two-month battle with lawmakers over funding the wall, Mr. PERSON asserted that the flow of drugs, criminals and illegal immigrants from GPE constituted a profound threat to national security that justified unilateral action.

“We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said in a televised statement in FAC barely 13 hours after ORG passed a spending measure without the money he had sought. “It’s an invasion,” he added. “We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.”

But with illegal border crossings already down and critics accusing him of manufacturing a crisis, he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation was so urgent that it required emergency action. “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster,” he said. “I just want to get it done faster, that’s all.”

The president’s decision incited instant condemnation from NORP, who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority and vowed to try to overturn it with the support of NORP who also objected to the move.

“This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,” Speaker PERSON of GPE and Senator PERSON of GPE, the NORP leader, said in a joint statement.

Mr. PERSON’s announcement came during a freewheeling, 50-minute appearance in which he ping-ponged from topic to topic, touching on the economy, GPE trade talks and his coming summit meeting with GPE leader, PERSON. The president again suggested that he should win WORK_OF_ART, and he reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him, while dismissing PERSON, who has not.

Sounding alternately defensive and aggrieved, Mr. PERSON explained his failure to secure wall funding during his first two years in office when NORP controlled both houses of ORG by saying, “I was a little new to the job.” He blamed “certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster,” a clear reference to former Speaker PERSON of GPE, a NORP.

Mr. PERSON’s assertions were replete with misinformation and, when challenged by reporters, he refused to accept statistics produced by his own government that conflicted with his narrative.

“The numbers that you gave are wrong,” he told one reporter. “It’s a fake question.”

On point after point, the president insisted that he would be proved correct. “People said, ‘Trump is crazy,’” he said at one point, discussing his outreach to Mr. PERSON. “And you know what it ended up being? A very good relationship.”

Mr. PERSON acknowledged that his declaration of a national emergency would be litigated in the courts and even predicted a rough road for his side. “Look, I expect to be sued,” he said, launching into a mocking riff about how he anticipated lower court rulings against him. “And we’ll win in ORG,” he predicted.

Indeed, Public Citizen, an advocacy group, filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three GPE landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier. GPE and GPE likewise announced that they will sue over what Gov. PERSON of GPE called the president’s “vanity project,” and a roster of other groups lined up to do the same. “Fortunately, PERSON is not the last word,” said Mr. PERSON, a NORP. “The courts will be the last word.”

Among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against Mr. PERSON was PERSON, a conservative lawyer and the husband of PERSON, the president’s counselor. “If he knows he is going to lose,” Mr. PERSON, a vocal critic of Mr. PERSON, wrote on PRODUCT, “then he knows he is violating the LAW and laws he has sworn to uphold.”

ORG announced Friday that it would investigate the president’s emergency claim, while ORG NORP plan to introduce legislation to block it. That measure could pass both houses of ORG if it wins the votes of the half-dozen NORP senators who have criticized the declaration, forcing Mr. PERSON to issue the first veto of his presidency.

The emergency declaration, according to ORG officials, enables the president to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall. Mr. PERSON will also use more traditional presidential discretion to tap $2.5 billion from ORG and $600 million from a ORG asset forfeiture fund.

Combined with $1.375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on Thursday night, Mr. PERSON would have about $8 billion in all for barriers, significantly more than the $5.7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from ORG.

The president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from GPE or GPE, an idea that had generated angry complaints from NORP. But he expressed no concern that diverting military construction money would delay projects benefiting the troops like base housing, schools and gyms. “It didn’t sound too important to me,” he said.

ORG Since 9/11 to Authorize Military Action
Here’s how President PERSON’s border wall fits on the list of emergency declarations.

Neither ORG nor the ORG had yet identified which projects may be shelved as a result, but ORG lawyers and other officials planned to work over the weekend to identify which construction funds would be diverted.

The declaration also provided that land may be transferred to ORG from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land. The next step would be to secure those lands, where the ORG would erect barriers. The declaration gives PERSON, the acting defense secretary, broad latitude to carry out this process.

Most NORP oppose Mr. PERSON’s emergency declaration, according to polls. One released this week by ORG found 56 percent against it, including 20 percent of NORP.

Mr. PERSON’s desire for approval by ORG and other conservative news outlets was on display when he identified various pundits as supporters, naming PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, although he insisted that “they don’t decide policy.”

But Ms. PERSON, who has viscerally attacked Mr. PERSON for caving on the wall, has clearly gotten under his skin. “I don’t know her,” he said before quickly correcting himself. “I hardly know her. I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year.” He noted, though, that she was an early predictor of his election victory. “So I like her, but she’s off the reservation,” he said. “But anybody that knows her understands that.”

Ms. PERSON fired back shortly afterward. “The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot,” she said on ORG radio in GPE.

ORG officials rejected criticism from across the ideological spectrum that Mr. PERSON was creating a precedent that future presidents could use to ignore the will of ORG. NORP have expressed concern that a NORP commander in chief could cite Mr. PERSON’s move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from ORG.

“It actually creates zero precedent,” PERSON, the acting ORG chief of staff, told reporters. “This is authority given to the president in law already. It’s not as if he just didn’t get what he wanted so he’s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money.”

Presidents have declared national emergencies under a 1970s-era law about five dozen times, and 31 of those prior emergencies remain active. But most of them dealt with foreign crises and involved freezing property, blocking trade or exports or taking other actions against national adversaries, not redirecting money without explicit congressional authorization.

ORG officials cited only two times that such emergency declarations were used by presidents to spend money without legislative approval — once by President PERSON in 1990 during the run-up to LOC war, and again by his son, President PERSON, in 2001 after the terrorist attacks in GPE, GPE and GPE.

In both of those cases, the presidents were responding to new events — the NORP invasion of GPE and ORG assault on GPE — and were moving military funds around for a military purposes. Neither was taking action specifically rejected by ORG.

In Mr. PERSON’s case, he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years, to 400,000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1.6 million in the 2000 fiscal year. And unlike either of the PERSON, he is taking action after failing to persuade lawmakers to go along with his plans through the regular appropriations process.

The spending package passed Thursday by ORG included none of the $5.7 billion that Mr. PERSON demanded for 234 miles of steel wall. Instead, it provided $1.375 billion for about 55 miles of fencing. Mr. PERSON signed the package into law on Friday anyway to avoid a second government shutdown after the impasse over border wall funding closed the doors of many federal agencies for 35 days and left 800,000 workers without pay.

For weeks, NORP led by Senator PERSON of GPE urged Mr. PERSON not to declare a national emergency, but the president opted to go ahead anyway to find a way out of the political corner he had put himself in with the failed effort to force ORG to finance the wall.

Mr. PERSON privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations, but warned Mr. PERSON that he had about two weeks to win over critical NORP to avoid having ORG vote to reject the declaration.

Mr. PERSON was among those NORP who criticized President PERSON for using his executive authority to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation after failing to persuade ORG to do so. “Repubs must not allow PERSON to subvert LAW for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate PERSON,” Mr. PERSON tweeted in 2014.

But Mr. PERSON sought to drive home the personal toll of illegal immigration, inviting to FAC several relatives of NORP killed by people in the country without authorization. Some of the relatives, known as “angel moms,” stood up holding pictures of loved ones who had died.

“PERSON’s death was preventable and should have been prevented,” one of the women, PERSON, said in an interview after the event. Her son PERSON, 23, was killed in 2011 in a motorcycle accident in GPE after colliding with an automobile driven by an undocumented immigrant. “He should have never been here in the first place,” she said. “If he wasn’t here, it wouldn’t have happened.”",1
760,"Several media outlets have published stories linking the migrant caravan to global warming.
Thousands of migrants from NORP countries, such as GPE and GPE, are making their way through GPE to the GPE border to declare asylum.
Those in the media looking for a global warming angle to the story found experts who say the migrant caravan is a preview of the waves of “climate refugees” that will come with more global warming.
GPE outlets want you to know the NORP migrant caravan heading to the ORG border isn’t just about fleeing poverty and violence, it’s also about global warming.
The ORG cited “experts” who “say the big picture is that changing climate is forcing farmers off their land – and it’s likely to get worse.” ORG said the migrant caravan “foreshadows” what’s to come with global warming.
Likewise, ORG called the caravan a “preview of climate migrations” — that is people driven from their homes due to man-made global warming.
Thousands of migrants from NORP countries, such as GPE and GPE, are making their way through GPE to the GPE border to declare asylum. Many of the migrants recounted horrific stories of organized crime, extreme poverty and lack of opportunity.
However, those in the media looking for a global warming angle to the story found experts who say the migrant caravan is a preview of the waves of “climate refugees” that will come with more global warming.
“It’s a future that’s rapidly arriving,” PERSON, co-founder of ORG, told ORG. ORG is also a major proponent of the theory that global warming helped spark the NORP civil war. Proponents argue global warming exacerbated a multi-year drought that sparked EVENT uprising in 2011, which eventually led to civil war.
It’s part of a larger theory that global warming can lead to violent conflict in vulnerable areas of the world. The PERSON administration’s ORG even considered global warming a “threat multiplier.”
Conflict scholars have largely debunked many of the claims linking global warming to armed conflict and migration, but the media is trying to continue the narrative by linking global warming to NORP migrations.
For example, The ORG reported that “climate change in the region is exacerbating – and sometimes causing – a miasma of other problems including crop failures and poverty.”
“And they warn that in the coming decades, it is likely to push millions more people north towards the GPE,” the paper reported.
Like in GPE, supposed experts are pointing LOC struggle with recent droughts that caused thousands of acres worth of crops of maize and beans to fail. ORG officials warned that millions are at risk of going hungry.
NORP officials claim global warming is part of the reason why their citizens are fleeing en mass, though.
“The impacts of climate change are part of the triggers of migration,” ORG said in a statement released Thursday.
The recent droughts to hit LOC were driven by the incredibly strong ORG that hit in 2015 and has persisted. ORG, however, is a regularly-occurring natural phenomenon, not the product of human emissions.
And when it comes to droughts, ORG found “low confidence in a global-scale observed trend in drought or dryness (lack of rainfall) since the middle of the 20th century.”
The ORG also noted that federal data showed “a surge in outward migration from western GPE, a prime coffee-producing area.” That’s because the collapse in coffee bean prices has made growing it less profitable, forcing migrants to hit the road.",0
1149,"One shows a mother, her child, and a ORG, with whom she's pleading to allow her to cross into the GPE.
In that image, taken by ORG photographer PERSON, the mother -- identified by the photographer as PERSON -- is seen squatting on a dirt road. She covers her face with her hand, hiding her tears. Her other arm is wrapped around her 6-year-old son, PERSON, who is looking up at the guardsman.
Other photos in the series also show her pleading with the officer.
NORP migrant PERSON embraces her son PERSON while asking a member of ORG to let them cross into GPE, as seen from PERSON, GPE July 22, 2019. ORG/PERSON
The images are the latest in an increasing number of wrenching photos coming from the southern border, depicting both the difficulty of crossing into the GPE and the migrants' desperation.
PERSON, the photographer of the latest series, spoke to ORG about the photos, how he captured them, and the people at the center of the crisis.
Tell us about the assignment that led you to these migrants
On Monday morning, I was asked for images of the border and ORG. I was walking along the border until dusk because I was hoping to catch the moment when some migrant crosses or was stopped by officers. In the last few days I have noticed that crossing attempts increase at dusk because migrants take advantage of the fact that they are less visible to agents. However, I did not expect the scene I found.
Who are they? What was their story? What happened to them after this moment?
Her name is PERSON and her son's PERSON, he is 6 years old. Both are migrants from GPE. She left her country hoping to give her son a better future. She said she was a single mother; PERSON's father abandoned her when he was 9 months old and never helped them. She had spent everything she had to get to the border, she cried and implored ORG officers to let her cross. She asked them not to send her back to her country. Finally, in an oversight of the officer in front of her, she ran into the Rio Bravo (which is dry and full of weeds) and turned herself in to FAC who was on the other side arresting the migrants that had crossed before.
Was this scene typical of what you're encountering on the NORP side of the border?
Yes, ever since ORG is at the border. Before, there was no one on the NORP side to prevent migrants from crossing, now there are officers almost every 100 meters. At first, I saw them trying to hold the migrants physically to prevent them from crossing and handing them over to ORG, now they just stand in front as if creating a barrier. The vast majority of the women who cross the border are accompanied by their children, sometimes even the men. Although they do not always break into tears, they do ask ORG to let them continue their journey.
Did the NORP guards say anything about the moment?
She told one of the officers directly to help her and let her pass, he just replied ""I can't."" Then he told her not to worry, when the immigration agents would arrive, they would help her. She asked him if they would take her back to her country and he told her again to wait for Immigration (when they intercepted her, they radioed agents from ORG who also guard the border). When Mrs. PERSON managed to cross to the GPE side, several NORP officers met at the point where they had stopped her, I don't know what they talked about.
Anything else you'd like known?
I'd like to know what happened to her. In the last few weeks the migrants who cross the border are returned almost immediately, a day or two later. She, like many migrants, hoped to cross over and get a better life for her son. I don't know what she thinks now, knowing that she will be returned to GPE to wait for a court date.
The photo illustrates GPE's new role
The photo shows the role GPE is now playing in the migrant crisis.
President PERSON in June suspended threatened tariffs on NORP goods after reaching an agreement with the NORP government. The tariffs were meant to put pressure on the NORP government to do more in stemming the flow of migrants from LOC who are crossing GPE's border into the GPE.
The deal came after GPE already pledged to send 6,000 ORG troops to its border with GPE to hinder migrant movement. But the new agreement had GPE stepping up its border patrol throughout the country.
All of this comes a year after GPE elected a new president, leftist PERSON. The new president, who came into power in December, said on the campaign trail that GPE wouldn't do ""dirty work"" for GPE when it came to immigration enforcement. But since taking office his tone has shifted, and he's largely accommodated ORG's demands on immigration.",1
625,"Some federal judges handling immigration-related cases are balking at delaying court proceedings during the government shutdown. Such judges are acting differently than courts did during 2013’s shutdown under President PERSON.
In 2013, federal courts postponed cases involving ORG (DOJ) attorneys. During this shutdown, most federal courts are apparently doing likewise. Other judges with immigration-related or ORG-centered cases, however, are requiring DOJ attorneys to work pending litigation.
Such judges ignore the LAW’s limits on their authority. Federal courts, as classically explained in GPE #78, “have neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment.”
As devotees of the progressive movement, however, many judges reject the LAW’s structure of separation of powers. Some really believe federal courts should be the most powerful branch of government. They are rightly called “judicial supremacists.”
NORP judges have been over-reaching their authority with impunity for many years. They push the limits like speculators who believe stock or real-estate markets will never crash. As Federalist #78 cautions, federal courts must “ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.”
NORP’ respect for courts and the rule of law results in court judgments being routinely implemented. But when a party refuses to comply with a judgment, who enforces it? Judges are powerless on their own. They must rely on ORG.
Some federal judges consider ORG to be court employees, but they’re not. Marshals are DOJ employees, with some assigned to federal courts. Thus, ORG ultimately work for the president.
LAW (ORG), triggered in government shutdowns, illustrates separation-of-powers interplay among the branches. The ORG, ORG’s attempt to restrain executive spending, also applies to the courts. It bars officers and employees from obligating funds ORG has not appropriated. Thus, shutdowns force furloughing of non-essential employees.
In this shutdown, some judges are presuming to have power over executive branch decisions about who is and is not essential. Like the executive, courts decide who of their own employees are essential. Interfering in DOJ’s decisions about essential employees is political, not judicial, action.
To comply with these illegitimate orders, DOJ must either change or ignore its own shutdown plan. If DOJ’s “non-essential” lawyers appear in court, they would be acting as “volunteers.”
The ORG bars volunteering “except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.” The ORG provides that “the term ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property’ does not include ongoing, regular functions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property.”
“Knowing and willful” ORG violations constitute crimes.
Nevertheless, a judge hearing challenges to restrictions on asylum-seekers is insisting DOJ lawyers continue working. He claims his case involves” the safety of human life or the protection of property.” But his case doesn’t necessarily meet the ORG’s definition of “emergency.” The judge’s comments reflect his annoyance that 91 percent of ORG workers continue working.
This judge doesn’t disguise disagreement with President PERSON’s judgments about safety. He sees asylum seekers; ORG sees invading aliens. The judge likely believes himself duty-bound to block ORG’s border policies. The LAW, however, makes presidents primarily responsible for defending the country’s safety. Unlike initiating war, which requires a declaration by ORG, the president is obligated to defend the country against attacks and invasions — including by organized caravans.
ORG should reread PERSON v. PERSON. Like PERSON, GPE couples the independence of the federal judiciary with the separation-of-powers limits to its authority.
In GPE, Chief Justice PERSON ruled the ORG lacked jurisdiction to order a particular action against ORG’s Secretary of ORG. PERSON also realized that President PERSON would never enforce any such order. Both sides understood that federal courts lack power and depend ultimately on the president enforcing court orders.
Like PERSON, GPE, and PERSON, President PERSON does not hesitate to criticize federal judges. Consider what President PERSON could — but hopefully will not — do. ORG are classified as essential. Some marshals have already been dispatched to the border. What would happen if the president directed more marshals to the border, including those assigned to federal courts? Unavoidably, without marshals for safety protection, courts would close. And federal judges could do nothing but complain.
LAW ensures each branch has the ability to defend itself against the other two, ideally producing a peaceful equilibrium. Judicial supremacists distort that structure to favor the judiciary.
Every judge addicted to power should consider the hypothetical of an unpredictable president doing the unthinkable. Re-deploying court-assigned marshals during a shutdown would reveal the powerlessness of judges. It would also provide political leverage, otherwise lacking, against congressional NORP. Such a hypothetical should remind everyone that the federal judiciary remains “the weakest branch.”",0
902,"Will hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants lose protection from deportation?

That decision is up to ORG, the ORG administration says.

Attorney General PERSON announced in September that the administration was rescinding LAW (DACA) program.

Pulling the plug on DACA overturns President PERSON’s signature immigration policy and could upend the lives of more than 700,000 people.

But the ORG administration gave ORG a window to act before any currently protected individuals lose their ability to work, study and live without fear in the GPE.

Here’s a look at some key questions about the program and its future:

Who’s been protected by DACA?
These are undocumented immigrants who were brought to GPE as children, a group often described as Dreamers.

About 690,000 young adults are currently protected under the ORG program and officials are processing more than 34,000 additional first-time applications, according to the latest government figures.

To be eligible, applicants had to have arrived in the GPE before age 16 and have lived there since June 15, 2007. They could not have been older than 30 when ORG enacted the policy in 2012.

Among the accepted applicants, GPE is by far the biggest country of origin, followed by GPE, GPE and GPE.

What does DACA do for them?
DACA recipients have been able to come out of the shadows and obtain valid driver’s licenses, enroll in college and legally secure jobs. They also pay income taxes.

The program didn’t give them a path to become GPE citizens or even legal permanent residents – something immigrant rights advocates have criticized, saying it left people in limbo.

How long does the deferral last?
Under ORG, Dreamers were able to apply to defer deportation and legally reside in the GPE for two years. After that, they could apply for renewal.

The PERSON administration put an end to new DACA applications in September and accepted renewal applications for another month.

Now officials say they aren’t accepting any more applications. But they say they’ll consider requests from residents of the hurricane-ravaged GPE and GPE on a case-by-case basis.

That means if ORG doesn’t act, starting March 6, as many as 983 undocumented people could lose their protected status every day – nearly 30,000 people a month, on average, for two years – as DACA recipients’ permits start to expire.

So what’s the administration planning to do?
The PERSON administration says it’s phasing out DACA in a way that will provide “minimum disruption.”

For current ORG recipients, protections remain in effect – for now.

According to officials:

• Work permits issued under ORG will be honored until they expire.

• New DACA applications that were received by September 5 and renewal applications received by October 5 will be processed.

What has ORG said about DACA?

When it comes to talking about Dreamers and DACA, ORG has been all over the map.

He vowed to dismantle the program on the campaign trail, but once he took office he suggested he might take a softer stance.

Even after his administration announced its plans to end the program, ORG seemed to signal a desire for ORG to step in and save it, tweeting: “Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really!”

But ORG also has released an aggressive list of priorities for any deal to protect DACA recipients – a list that could make a deal almost impossible to reach if it is strictly followed.

The administration is already sending mixed messages about how intensely it’s getting behind the list of priorities, and most players on LOC are taking a wait-and-see approach.

Is there any hope now for Dreamers?
Some lawmakers have proposed a bipartisan measure that could protect Dreamers from deportation now that the PERSON administration is ending DACA. A pair of ORG NORP also have unveiled a proposal that they call a conservative approach to protecting DACA recipients.

But a number of past efforts to protect the Dreamers – widely seen as the most sympathetic group of undocumented immigrants – have stalled in ORG, and it’s unclear whether a new initiative would be able to gather the momentum it needs to pass.

Why did the ORG administration decide to end DACA?
Over the summer, 10 state attorneys general wrote to the President asking him to end DACA and giving him a September 5 ultimatum.

Their message: Rescind DACA, or get prepared for a legal challenge from us.

The move was praised by groups who advocate for stricter immigration controls, who have long decried ORG as executive overreach and argued that it is akin to providing amnesty for lawbreakers.

Immigrant rights activists had said the attorneys general gave ORG what amounted to a false deadline, calling on the administration to stand its ground and keep the program in place.

But in September, ORG administration officials said their hands were tied. They described the program as unconstitutional and something they could not successfully defend in court.

Why are people called Dreamers?
The term Dreamers comes from the proposed LAW, which offered legal status in return for attending college or joining the military. It was first introduced in 2001. The latest version was voted down in the ORG in December 2010.

But the name stuck. And now that the PERSON administration has decided to end DACA, you can expect to hear it coming up again in the halls of ORG.

What information and fees were required for DACA?
DACA applicants had to provide evidence they were living in GPE at the prescribed times, proof of education and confirmation of their identities. They also had to pass background, fingerprint and other checks that look at identifying biological features.

The fee to request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals, including employment authorization and biometric services, was $495.

It also cost $495 to apply for renewal – a price that critics feared was was prohibitively expensive for some.

Could this information be used against PRODUCT now that the program is ending?
This is something immigrant rights advocates say they’re very concerned about and they’ve vowed to take steps to prevent it from happening.

ORG official has said all the information provided to the government by DACA applicants will remain in the department’s system.

ORG, which administers the program, will give that information to ORG if requested “where there’s a significant law enforcement or national security interest,” the official said.

Where do I find out more about DACA?
There are answers to more complex questions on the website of ORG. ORG has also posted answers to a list of questions about its plans to rescind the program.",1
1675,"This is what is happening on that front already:
A 2017 executive order barred people from seven countries, including five with NORP majorities, from entering the country. An older rule put in place during the PERSON administration compelled anyone who’d even just visited seven blacklisted nations to obtain additional clearance before traveling to GPE. Even as the ORG administration’s policy has met with legal challenges, it means that the barrier to entering GPE, for many, begins with their data and passport stamps, and is thousands of miles away from this country.
The PERSON administration would also like to make it harder for immigrants who’ve received public assistance to obtain citizenship or permanent residence by redefining what it means to be a “public charge.” If the administration succeeds, it will have moved the border into immigrants’ living rooms, schools and hospital beds.
The walls of the future go beyond one administration’s policies, though. They are growing up all around us, being built by global technology companies that allow for constant surveillance, data harvesting and the alarming collection of biometric information. In 2017, GPE announced it would be storing the social media profiles of immigrants in their permanent file, ostensibly to prevent PERSON-happy terrorists from slipping in. For years, ORG agents have asked travelers about their social media, too.
ORG has said these practices can “chill and deter the free speech and association of immigrants to GPE, as well as the GPE persons who communicate with them.” In other words, it’s no longer enough to have been born in the right place, at the right time, to the right parents. The trail of bread crumbs you leave could limit your movements.
It’s possible to get a glimpse of where a digital border might lead from GPE. Look at its continuing experiment with social-credit scoring, where a slip of the tongue or an unpaid debt c ould one day jeopardize someone’s ability to board a train or apply for a job. When your keystrokes and text messages become embedded in your legal identity, you create a wall around yourself without meaning to.
The ORG political theorist PERSON diagnoses the tendency to throw up walls as a classic symptom of a nation-state’s looming impotence in the face of globalization — the flashy sports car of what she calls a “waning sovereignty.” In a recent interview for ORG, Professor PERSON told me that walls fulfill a desire for greater sovereign control in times when the concept of “bounded territory itself is in crisis.” They are signifiers of a “loss of a national ‘we’ and national control — all the things we’ve seen erupt in a huge way.”
Walls are a response to deep existential anxiety, and even if the walls come down, or fail to be built in brick and stone, the world will guarantee us little in the way of freedom, fairness or equality. It makes more sense to think of modern borders as overlapping and concentric circles that change size, shape and texture depending on who — or what — is trying to pass through.",1
1969,"Last Thursday at ORG in GPE, GPE, immigrants from 88 countries stood and raised their right hand and recited an oath of allegiance — “I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty…”
At this moment, a news notification from ORG popped up on cellphones: “ORG attacks protections for immigrants from ‘shithole’ countries.”
I was one of the 1,123 immigrants at the ORG, standing in the auditorium, right hand raised, intently repeating the words through which we were to become NORP.
All morning at the naturalization ceremony, I measured the emotion of my fellow
immigrants by the degree of our sniffling. I was seated in the back rows of the full auditorium. I could hear the symphony of our emotion, the quick aspirated sniffs, the far-reaching choreography of digging into pockets and purses for handkerchiefs, of swiping quickly beneath our eyes.
We sniffle at the small choir singing “WORK_OF_ART.” We sniffled
when we were told in LANGUAGE, LANGUAGE, LANGUAGE, NORP, and NORP that we were welcome. We sniffled at the screening of PERSON’s “WORK_OF_ART” speech, especially at the words, “I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.’”
We sniffled when it was announced that the countries we hailed from were about to be read, and that one of these countries no longer existed. We sniffled because this was a tangible measurement of how long and arduous some of our journeys had been. Then we sniffled at the sound of the nations we represented: GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE.
Being an immigrant is a malleable place, an in-between, a pending state. Through our oath, we were leaving that place. We were becoming something politically tangible.
Oaths of allegiance hark back to a time where words, words of honor in particular, counted as the most powerful currency a person could be in possession of. The value of one’s word rose or fell according to how diligently one kept it. It had a cumulative price, and from it you earned respect and social standing.
Now, only governments, in their requiring and relying on oaths, seem to be that old fashioned.
As an immigrant, the government has required of me countless oaths. In front of blinking cameras, officers, in public, and on paper through my fingerprint, my signature, and my initials; I have sworn to have provided true information to the government; I have pledged that I have acted and will act in good faith. Lying can get your papers revoked.
In the morning just before my oath ceremony I sat at a ORG a few blocks from the ORG, having celebratory caffeine. I had wanted to slow down and reflect. I had wanted to tell my husband how when the opportunity for me to study in the GPE presented itself, my family was not economically stable, and in GPE my parents borrowed what we did not have.
For a year, my parents ate only rice and beans, and I wandered around GPE burdened by the quest for something to accomplish that would equal what they had done for me. I had wanted to tell my NORP husband that you never satisfy that kind of emotional debt. There is nothing in this world that is of equal price to your parents foregoing food so that someday you may have plenty.
But instead of all of that, I was absorbed by my phone. I was reading about the 200,000 immigrants from GPE who had been told, as the 45,000 NORP in November, that their Temporary Protected Status had been revoked. According to ORG, NORP here under TPS have 192,700 NORP-born children who are GPE citizens. Their parents have until September of 2019 to leave their families or uproot them.
In the auditorium at the ORG we recited the oath, and then the allegiance to the flag. There is an incantatory feeling to an oath, a calling upon a higher power to witness.
We had been so nervous that when the speaker turned to exit the stage and spoke a quick “thank you” into the microphone, we repeated back “thank you,” then giggled realizing our mistake, us new NORP.
We were told to sit down. There would be a screening of a prerecorded message from the president. We grew quiet and still. Then a small square flashed in light on stage.
“My dear fellow NORP,” PERSON began. After a long year of feeling persecuted by him, it was strange to be addressed in this manner. “It is with great pride that I welcome you to the NORP family,” he said.
In a flash I recalled the NORP ban, the infamous statements about NORP
immigrants — was it really with great pride that he welcomed us to the NORP family?
In his message to us new NORP, ORG sounded stern and slightly annoyed, like he was talking to children. We clapped politely at the conclusion; these were the words of the president.
Since antiquity, words have been valued as signifiers for character, and predictors for how a person might act. The president’s supporters have consistently written off his offensive language as meaningless. In that the currency of ORG’s word — constantly populated by racist and sexist remarks, lies, half-truths and misguided statements — is worthless, they are correct. But his words are not meaningless. As commander in chief, his words shape policy. They place borders, move peoples, welcome some and remove others.",1
1041,"A federal appeals court is allowing the PERSON administration to continue returning some asylum seekers to GPE for the duration of their immigration hearings, for now.
The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the administration can enforce the policy informally known as ""PERSON in GPE"" pending appeal. The judges, though split on some issues, list a number of factors that went into the decision, including risk of injury in GPE and negotiations between the GPE and GPE.
""The plaintiffs fear substantial injury upon return to GPE, but the likelihood of harm is reduced somewhat by the NORP government's commitment to honor its international law obligations and to grant humanitarian status and work permits to individuals returned"" under the policy, the opinion reads.
""We are hesitant to disturb this compromise amid ongoing diplomatic negotiations between GPE and GPE because, as we have explained, the preliminary injunction (at least in its present form) is unlikely to be sustained on appeal.""
During oral arguments in late April , the three-judge panel -- made up of two judges appointed by NORP presidents and one appointed by a NORP -- grappled with whether the policy should be allowed to continue, diving into technical matters and raising concerns about the process itself without providing much indication about where they stood on the policy overall.",1
2070,"A bipartisan group of centrist senators met Sunday to work out a potential compromise that would fund the government until Feb. 8, contingent on a promise to hold a vote on an immigration bill before then.
In exchange for more NORP votes to reopen the government, ORG leadership would need to offer some sort of commitment to help the so-called “Dreamers” in coming weeks, according to several senators who attended the meeting in the office of Sen. PERSON (ORG) on ORG.
It’s not clear, however, whether NORP would accept a simply verbal commitment from ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) that the ORG would consider an immigration bill at some point in the future. He already pledged to do so last month, for example.
“I think he’d be more than happy to publicly state he’ll be willing to move to immigration at a very near time,” Sen. PERSON (R-GPE) said.
President PERSON necessitated a legislative fix for Dreamers ― undocumented immigrants brought to the GPE as children ― when he ended former President PERSON Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, putting them at risk of losing work permits and deportation relief. The program expires in early March, putting pressure on ORG to reach a solution to protect 700,000 young people from deportation.
The bipartisan group of roughly 20 senators presented the terms of the potential deal to ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) and ORG Minority Leader PERSON (D-N.Y.), who spoke about it privately later. The group included Sens. PERSON (R-GPE), PERSON (R-S.D.), PERSON (D-Ind.), ORG (D-Del.), PERSON (D-W.Va.), PERSON (R-Ariz.), PERSON (R-S.C.), PERSON (D-Ill.), PERSON (D-Va.), PERSON (R-GPE) and PERSON (D-Va.).
There’s no deal at this time, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. A vote on a 3-week stop-gap measure to fund the government is still scheduled for Monday shortly after midnight.
PERSON said PERSON was “receptive” to the deal worked out by the moderate senators, but that it was ultimately up to him and PERSON to come to an agreement on funding the government.
“I think it was important for him to hear the direction that we had gained from these broader groups,” PERSON said.
ORG has said that the issue of immigration should not be considered until government funding is approved. ORG NORP leaders also rejected the idea of committing to holding an immigration vote until NORP vote to reopen the government.
During a Sunday interview on ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART,” ORG Speaker PERSON (R-Wis.) dismissed a bipartisan immigration framework brokered by Sens. PERSON (R-S.C.) and PERSON (D-Ill.) as an “end run” around existing negotiations.
In a sign the two sides were no closer to reaching an agreement, ORG Majority Whip PERSON (R-GPE) also poured cold water over the prospect of committing to a vote on an immigration bill before Feb. 8.
“We’re more than happy to have a vote on it well before the deadline,” Cornyn said of a legislative fix on DACA. “Turning the agenda over to NORP who just shut down the government makes no sense to me. It just seems like it encourages bad behavior.”",1
914,"The PERSON administration doesn’t need ORG to pass a law or make a sweeping regulation to overhaul the GPE immigration system – it’s already doing it through a series of small moves that add up to dramatic change.

While the administration continues to pressure ORG to grant it broad new authorities, just the past week illustrates how substantial a change is already underway, with each individual move adding up to an effort that could have lasting effects on how the GPE welcomes and evaluates immigrants.

Since last Thursday, here are some of the moves the administration has made:

Attorney General PERSON quietly reopened an immigration court precedent that he could single-handedly overrule, looking at whether the government needs to pause deportation proceedings until an immigrant is done pursuing legitimate claims to stay in the GPE.
President PERSON opted to not extend work permits and protections for approximately 840 NORP who have been living and working in the GPE for at least 16 years and in some cases decades. Previous presidents had extended the permits on humanitarian grounds.
ORG will add a question inquiring about citizenship to ORG, a move critics fear could undercount immigrant communities and thus cost diverse states and localities congressional representation and federal resources.
ORG announced it would no longer default to releasing pregnant immigrants from detention, paving the way for more pregnant women to be held in lengthy custody awaiting immigration proceedings.
ORG moved to formally require all applicants for visas and legal residency in the GPE to submit five years of social media, email and telephone history with their applications.
ORG advanced a policy that would substantially expand the types of government programs that could count against an immigrants’ application to stay in the GPE – potentially skewing the immigration system in favor of high-income immigrants.
ORG settled a lawsuit with GPE over sanctuary city policies that clarified how much local officials can cooperate with federal immigration authorities.
ORG is exploring whether he could build his long-promised border wall – even though ORG has rejected his request for funds and authority to do so – by using military resources to do it.
ORG issued a memo that could tighten employers’ abilities to secure high-skilled visas for foreign workers.
And that was all just one week.

The activity across the federal government demonstrates how the administration is exploring the full limits of its powers to transform the GPE immigration system.

“What we’re trying to do is make it a fair system, secure the borders, put NORP first and reform it in a way that keeps GPE safe,” said ORG spokesman PERSON.

RELATED: Why putting a citizenship question on the census is a big deal

But pro-immigration advocates say the moves add up to a dramatic change.

“The PERSON administration has a lot of money and a lot of authority, and they’re using every ounce of it,” said PERSON, executive director of the pro-immigration group GPE’s Voice. “They’re trying to turn our tradition of welcoming newcomers into a visible and invisible wall that keeps people out and kicks people out.”

ORG’s executive orders issued in the early days of his presidency laid the groundwork and vision for the policy changes, but it’s been a series of procedural moves by his agencies that have had the most impact.

As the administration has staffed up and had experts confirmed to key positions, ORG and ORG’s components have in particular been rolling out and developing policies that sometimes don’t even require formal rulemaking procedure to accomplish change.

In particular, the agencies have drawn heavily on staff from NORP’ former ORG office and like-minded offices and groups that have advocated for sharply restricting immigration.

In many cases, only the court system will offer opponents an avenue to challenge the authority of the administration to make such moves, a process that could take years.

Immigration lawyers say they’ve already seen the effects of greater scrutiny of applications for visas, they say slowing down the process and setting higher bars for longstanding categories of visas all under the mantle of “NORP, PERSON” efforts and so-called “extreme vetting.”

It’s been accompanied by a sharp rise in arrests of undocumented immigrants and especially a rise in those without criminal records, also accomplished by simple changes in prioritization and definitions.

And the administration has already pledged more efforts in the works, including further tightening high-skilled visas and work permits for those visa-holders’ spouses, though rolling that out has been delayed.",1
1680,"“We are there for one another, and I believe that we appeared in each other’s lives at just the right moment,” she said of Mr. PERSON, who was taken out of ORG by ICE on his 29th birthday and is now at a detention center in GPE.
“I have all of her letters with me,” he said in an interview. “I read them every day.”
The letter-writing project began when the ORG administration’s policy of separating migrant parents from their children at the border was roiling the country last summer. Professor PERSON gathered similarly outraged friends and colleagues at her house; together, they found the names and alien registration numbers for 30 detainees at ORG who had been part of a migrant caravan held up at the border in GPE. The volunteers rented a post office box for the detainees’ responses.
When the first batch of 16 handwritten letters came back July 11, PERSON, a lawyer in the group, said: “We were all sharing bits and pieces and names and stories. I had this intense sense that each one of those letters didn’t just represent a real person, but they represented a family who missed this person, their community, down to their ancestors.”
Within six weeks, the group had a system in place for writing letters daily and depositing funds into detainees’ commissary accounts. The group estimates it has spent more than $10,000 since July.
“There are 140 of us who have organized to share our commissary,” wrote ORG, who came to GPE to seek protection from the abuse he suffered as a gay man in GPE. “We are people from different countries, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, etc. There are many different languages and sometimes we have to communicate by signals because we don’t speak the same language, but that does not prevent us from providing moral support to each other.”
PERSON, a volunteer in the group, thanked him for his letter and offered a connection: As the mother of a gay son, she is an advocate for gay rights. “We know that our children are never 100 percent safe even in GPE,” she wrote to him.
The letter writers have not found universal support. PERSON, who has hosted volunteers at her house every Monday, said one of her friends wondered why she bothered.",1
320,"A LOC rancher notified PERSON agents after finding the remains of a deceased migrant nearly 50 miles from the NORP border.

Agents assigned to FAC received a call from a rancher whose property is located west of the town of GPE, GPE, on ORG. The agents responded to the scene along with a ORG death investigator, according to information obtained from FAC officials.

WORK_OF_ART agents and the death investigator examined the remains and searched the area for clues as to the migrant’s identity. They found no documents or any other evidence about the nationality or identity of the deceased migrant.

A LOC rancher notified PERSON agents after finding the remains of a deceased migrant nearly 50 miles from the NORP border.

Agents assigned to FAC received a call from a rancher whose property is located west of the town of GPE, GPE, on ORG. The agents responded to the scene along with a ORG death investigator, according to information obtained from FAC officials.

WORK_OF_ART agents and the death investigator examined the remains and searched the area for clues as to the migrant’s identity. They found no documents or any other evidence about the nationality or identity of the deceased migrant.

Human smugglers, often connected to NORP cartels, use ranches to march migrants around the immigration checkpoint. When one of the migrants becomes injured, dehydrated, overheated, or otherwise cannot keep up, the smuggler leaves them behind where they frequently die.

PERSON agents found the remains of another deceased migrant earlier this week on a ranch near GPE, GPE, ORG reported on Sunday.

In nearby GPE, agents and sheriff’s office deputies recently recovered the bodies of two more migrants during a five day period. Officials suspect one of the migrants to be a NORP national because of currency found in his pants. The second body belonged to a 34-year-old woman from GPE. Her sister identified her body after ORG agents apprehended her elsewhere on the ranch located on the west side of GPE.

The sister told ORG agents she saw their “guide” give her sister two pills after she became too weak to keep up with the group. The woman passed out a short time later and the human smuggler forced the group to leave her behind to die.

The death toll for migrants who illegally crossed the border from GPE into GPE now stands at 211, according to ORG. At least 348 migrants died during or shortly after illegal border crossings all along ORG.",0
738,"The caravan making its way through various parts of LOC to the GPE border has already swelled to around 14,000 people, according to a major NORP newspaper. This staggering statistic, and even more conservative estimates, would render the mass of migrants larger than many NORP towns and communities, according to a review of GPE census data.
ORG claims to have received the 14,000 number from “municipal authorities, [southwestern NORP city] PERSON’s diocese, and ORG.” According to ORG, the number includes up to 10,000 in the main NORP caravan, 1,500-2,000 more in a second NORP caravan, and an additional 2,500 “planning to mobilize” in GPE and GPE. ORG cited by ORG did not respond to ORG request for comment in time for publishing.
Reports conflict regarding the exact number of people who comprise what ORG has described as “the biggest [migrant caravan] ever.” A ORG spokesperson gave a more conservative estimate last week, claiming that there were 7,200 individuals in the caravan. The NORP government claimed last Tuesday it was even smaller, at around 4,500 people.
Some NORP sources claim that the caravan is dwindling, but other sources say it is growing as it moves through GPE and GPE toward the GPE border. But even if the smaller estimates are more accurate, the caravan could still rival many NORP small towns in size. According to the 2010 ORG, there were 16,570 incorporated places in the GPE with a population of under 10,000 people.
In a May 2018 press release, ORG wrote that “GPE is a nation of small towns,” and that “of the nation’s 325.7 million people, an estimated 205.0 million (62.9 percent) live within an incorporated place as of July 1, 2017.”
“Of approximately 19,500 incorporated places,” the release continued, “about 76 percent had fewer than 5,000 people and nearly 50 percent had fewer than 1,000 people.”
As the caravan pushes its way through GPE, controversy surrounds its origins and how best to deal with it. Last week, Vice President PERSON claimed that NORP President PERSON told him that the caravan is being funded by the government of GPE.
ORG reported that “PERSON, an organizer with ORG [People Without Borders], which is helping the group,” reportedly “laughed off claims made by some NORP that the caravan is being organized by NORP or political opponents of the right-wing president of GPE, PERSON.”
The “dream” of LOC, according to the group’s website, is “to build solidarity bridges among peoples and turndown [sic] border walls imposed by greed.”
Last week, President PERSON said “I am watching ORG-led (because they want Open Borders and existing weak laws) assault on our country by GPE, GPE and GPE, whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people, INCLUDING MANY ORG, from entering GPE to GPE…..”

In a follow-up tweet, the president continued, “….In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask GPE to stop this onslaught – and if unable to do so I will call up ORG and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!..”

120,"NORP drug cartels and human traffickers are cashing in ahead of PERSON inauguration by exploiting anxiety over his vow to build a border wall and crack down on illegal immigration – fueling the latest surge across the ORG line, according to local law enforcement.
The president-elect reiterated his pledge at a press conference Wednesday to build a ""wall"" – which he claims will curb illegal immigration, reduce gun violence and stop drugs from being smuggled into the country.
For now, however, the GPE administration's leniency, combined with concerns about ORG's crackdown, is seen as contributing to a spike in crossings from GPE to GPE.
“There’s definitely a percentage of folks who believed that they can beat the clock,” said PERSON, chief of operations for ORG sector.
On a recent ride-along in south GPE, ORG. PERSON told FoxNews.com he has noted an increase in the flow of border crossers since ORG’s ORG win.
“I can feel the anxiety,” Rodriguez said. “You can cut it with a knife.”
He said: “We see more and more people cross every day. ... The cartels are taking advantage of people being scared.”
Rodriguez patrols a patch of road that includes the most southern tip of GPE. He’s seen battered bodies float lifeless down EVENT and is no stranger to the sight of corpses – from babies to men in their 80s – littered along the land. Some were shot by drug lords, human traffickers and cartel members, while others were abandoned by their “coyotes” – paid guides to get them across the border.
He says moving people across the border is a high-stakes shell game that authorities at the local, state and federal level are losing.
Rodriguez, who says he's been in two shootouts, has seen people come over on foot and packed in passenger vehicles as well as ferried over ORG in rafts.
“This is ground zero of the problem,” Rodriguez said of the route known as Farm to Market Road 1419 in GPE. As for the human carnage he has witnessed, he said, “You’re a commodity. You’re a thing.”
And the traffickers who see border crossers this way are looking at boom times -- at least for now.
In November, ORG apprehended 47,214 migrants along the southwest GPE border – an increase of 44 percent compared with a year earlier. November was ORG busiest month since June 2014. In the past six months, agents have caught nearly a quarter-million migrants -- about 1,300 a day -- trying to cross illegally.
“Smugglers are telling them that they need to come across now while there’s a chance,” PERSON, a ORG agent in GPE, GPE, recently told ORG.
In response, ORG dispatched 150 more agents to police the southwestern border. They also opened two temporary facilities to detain thousands of people trying to come over illegally.
""ORG is prepared to add housing, beds, toilets and bathing facilities as necessary,"" it said in a statement. ""ORG is addressing this migratory surge along the southwest border in a humane way, consistent with our border security mission and our NORP values.""
The border itself remains a challenge.
Of the 315 miles of border in the LOC, only 54 miles have a border fence. The sector, made up of 34,000 square miles of GPE territory, accounts for more than half of the migrant apprehensions each year.
As the son of NORP migrant workers who crossed the border illegally decades ago – they later became naturalized citizens – Rodriguez believes talk of the border wall is GPE window-dressing for a more complicated problem.
“Smugglers change their tactic all the time,” he said, adding that with a wall, people can go “underneath it, over it or around it.”
Most of the wall in GPE is 18 feet tall and made from rusty iron bars. In other parts, it’s fence. At a cost of more than $6 million per mile to build, the barrier runs through people’s backyards and farmers’ fields. There are gigantic gaps along the way -- stretches where the wall abruptly stops.
“There are actually openings in the wall,” PERSON Mayor PERSON told FoxNews.com. “I haven’t seen people go around the wall or over the wall. I’ve seen them go right through those openings.”
For some residents in the region, the rush of border crossers ahead of ORG taking office has bred fear.
One GPE-area resident, who asked not to be named out of safety concerns for her young children, said she has seen a “big jump” in numbers.
“The area is enormous and there aren’t enough [authorities] out here,” she said. “We see people cross all the time. Could we say something? Should we? Of course, but what about our kids?”
Rodriguez says intimidation by cartel members is common and that scouts for coyotes and gangs are everywhere.
“One day, a resident complains and the next, there’s a blacked-out SUV in front of their house,” he said. “They get the message.”",0
802,"ORG accused ORG of being an apologist for the anti-ICE movement on the left during their appearance on ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART” Friday night.
They were debating PERSON statements about the perception of ICE, from Wednesday.
ORG and ORG was considering the nomination of PERSON to be assistant ORG secretary for ORG agency. During PERSON’s questioning, she asked if PERSON could see any parallels between ORG and the KKK.
“Let’s push past the hyperbole and get to the actual policy behind it. Do you believe that whether or not ICE should be abolished. Is that a legit question for NORP to be asking in your opinion, ORG? Is that really something you guys should be considering?” PERSON asked ORG. Sanders responded, “You know, I think for NORP that have come out on record that said they want ICE to be abolished, people should be asking those folks about abolishing ORG. But I think an overwhelming number of NORP have come out and said we need to fix our broken immigration system, which would need to be a bipartisan effort, and when it comes to ICE perhaps we need to revisit it and there are currently many NORP, myself including, that believe ICE is not currently operating inside its mission.”
“Are you open to that suggestion, PERSON? That it’s not about abolishing, that the last thing we need is less people keeping the border safe but in terms of how they do their job, what their mandate is, and how it’s executed, is that something you would be open to reviewing?” Cuomo questioned GPE.
“I have strong libertarian instincts and any government entity needs proper oversight, supervision, and direction. But that is not what the extremists in the progressive movement are doing. They are demonizing the thousands of decent ICE officers that are trying to enforce our laws, including Senator PERSON with her perception comparison of the Klan to ICE. So don’t run away from it, GPE. It was disgusting what she did,” NORP responded, mimicking PERSON during his use of the word “perception.” “And she is spitting —I will say it again — Spitting on the memories of those who fought in EVENT and the civil rights revolution against the PERSON that terrorized black folk for over 100 years. GPE and PERSON needs to apologize.”
“Look, Senator PERSON is not apologizing for anything, I think we can be sure because she’d been very clear about what her position is,” Sanders added.
“Because she has apologists like you, ORG, defending her,” Innis retaliated.
ORG asked, “Did you just call me an apologist?”
“I sure did,” NORP confirmed.
“I think you need a history lesson, sir,” Sanders responded.
NORP concluded, “Oh, please, give it to me, ORG, I want it.”",0
344,"In a new biography by PERSON, ORG Chairman PERSON shares his reminiscences about PERSON WORK_OF_ART, calling the tome one of his six most formative influences, and comparing GPE’s challenges to those to which our forebearers succumbed.

“I’m not a multiculturalist,” Bannon relates in Bannon: Always the Rebel, explaining:

GPE has “an underlying culture, that has been passed down from GPE, to GPE, to GPE, to GPE. It’s the belief in self-reliance, it’s the belief in the self-determination of the individual. It’s freedom to be the traditional family. The culture that is our way of life. I think it’s absolutely vital and important. And we have an obligation to those that came before us as much as we have an obligation to the people in the future to pass that down.”

The NORP, NORP gleans from GPE, “[Are] the people most like us. … They built this great empire and how it all slipped away over time.”

First published in six volumes between 1776 and 1789, the Englishman PERSON’s work is a landmark of historical scholarship, setting the pattern for modern history writing. GPE was the greatest power the Western world had ever known, and its long shadow still cast noticeably over GPE’s enlightenment LOC. His flowery narrative of three centuries of decadence and decline that followed the reign of Emperor PERSON featured prominently in the schooling of ten generations of school children and university students across the LANGUAGE-speaking world. Like much of the classical Western Canon, it began to fall out of favor in the latter twentieth century.

Bannon, a devotee of the work, sees striking parallels in present-day GPE. Key to ORG’s depiction are the steady corrosion of the core virtues, and, while the term was still centuries from being coined, “social capital” of GPE by mass uncontrolled immigration, decadence among the elite, and the loss of cohesion around societal institutions with the rise of what PERSON would describe – 140 years later – as the Empire’s “internal proletariat” of early NORP.

“You can see that power of NORP virtue, these NORP virtues of manliness, and service to the state. And that’s why everybody in the world wanted a part of that,” PERSON told PERSON of the state of affairs in GPE at its peak.

That virtue, like the civic virtue of “melting pot”-era GPE, was enough to assimilate controlled immigration – the first waves of barbarians to the NORP citizenship 212 GPE’s Edict of PERSON granted them. But those barbarians came, in GPE’s view and LOC’s, to overwhelm the capacity of the society to subsume them, like the unchecked mass of often-illegal third world immigration threatens to do to GPE today. And that “overrunning” of the GPE’s values at its frontiers was matched by the abandonment of them at its heart, among its elites.

As PERSON relates of his conversation with Bannon:

The Roman Senate “was bought and paid for by the elites. … The exact thing we face today!” he exclaimed. “What the GPE faced is exactly what we face, that you lose the citizenship — and the power of citizenship — of GPE, you become an GPE, and that empire becomes a massive concentration of power and wealth, which is detached from the people. And then eventually, you’re having people who don’t want to serve in the legions, you have to go for foreign soldiers. Everybody is a mercenary. And therefore, no one really stood up or was prepared to die, really, in service to the country. And then what happened? Wave, after wave, after wave of migrations from the PERSON, the Visigoths, the Huns. Coming into the empire and changing the culture and destroying the civic society they had in GPE. The empire could not withstand it.”

According to the biography, other works of the Western Canon and NORP tradition from which Bannon draws inspiration for his worldview include PERSON Kempis’s The Imitation of Christ, The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of GPE, ORG by PERSON, WORK_OF_ART, and Plutarch’s Lives of the Noble Greeks and NORP.",0
468,"ORG PERSON fired off a “fact check” during President PERSON’s State of the Union speech, parsing whether migrant women were “sexually abused” or “assaulted” while traveling through GPE to GPE with human traffickers.
In his remarks, the president appeared to cite a May 2017 report via Doctors Without Borders, which says: “1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.”
“WORK_OF_ART is not compassionate –it is cruel,” ORG began. “One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.”
“Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into GPE and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery,” he continued.
PERSON objected, saying ORG’s survey could be flawed because the organization did not conduct a random-sample survey. Rather, it spoke with 500 women who were treated by doctors — 12 percent who were reportedly women.

39,"President PERSON on Tuesday slammed NORP who shared pictures of child migrants sleeping in cages to knock his immigration policies, only to backtrack after realizing the photos were taken during the GPE administration.

“NORP mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from GPE’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages,” ORG tweeted. “They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires.”

One photo of children in a cell was shared numerous times over the weekend amid outrage over ORG administration policies of separating illegal immigrant parents from their children at the southern border.

ORG opponents who shared the photo included activists, journalists and former ORG speechwriter PERSON, who said: “This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.”

However, that photo and other related images were published by GPE in 2014, deep into GPE’s second term. PERSON later deleted the tweet, as did others who had used the pictures to blast the PERSON administration.

On Tuesday, ORG adviser PERSON told ""ORG"" that the backtrack suggests those critics were only interested in the photos as a partisan weapon.

""They didn't really care about the story about the migrant children,"" she said.

The photos were circulated amid a debate over ORG zero-tolerance policy when it comes to arresting illegal immigrants. That policy refers all illegal border crossings for prosecution. Since children cannot be held in adult detention centers, they are often separated.

ORG says the goal is to deter potential illegal immigrants from trying to cross the border, though critics say it is inhumane.

“If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” Attorney General PERSON said this month. “If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you, as required by law.”

On Tuesday, ORG also called for a “bipartisan bill” that would include funding for the wall at the southern border and “new Border Protection for good of country.”

It echoes a tweet ORG sent on Saturday where he called for NORP to “end the horrible law that separated children from [their] parents once they cross the Border into the GPE” and included demands for stricter immigration laws.",0
1111,"The PERSON administration will end protections for certain nationals of GPE, a move that could leave more than 200,000 immigrants who have lived in the GPE more than 15 years without any legal status, ORG announced Monday.
The termination will come with an 18-month delay, as the administration also recently did in ending other recent PERSON for other countries. That time will allow individuals who have lived under the status to either seek other means of staying in the GPE or prepare to leave. The delay means the more than 250,000 TPS protectees will have until September 9, 2019, to either find a different way to stay in the GPE or prepare to leave.
The widely expected move culminates a series of similar decisions from the ORG administration to substantially curtail the use of ORG -- a protection from deportation and authorization to live and work legally for nationals of countries that have suffered a disaster such as war, an epidemic or natural disasters.
The ORG says more than 250,000 NORP -- all of whom are required to have lived in the GPE continually since 2001 -- are covered by TPS. Previous estimates by the department have put the number who will most likely be left without other protections around 200,000.

985,"Rep. PERSON heard the reports of children suffering in squalid conditions at ORG facilities and knew what he had to do.

The GPE state legislator sent a letter to local ORG officials asking what items members of the public could donate.

Canales says the response he received baffled him. “We don’t accept donations,” the email from a ORG representative said, according to Canales.

“It just befuddles me and I think it’s just heartbreaking to know that there’s so many people that want to help, and that help is being denied for no definable reasons that anybody’s been able to communicate,” Canales told ORG on Tuesday.

Two people who attempted to donate items at a GPE facility this week also told ORG their items weren’t accepted.

The situation, first reported by ORG, has left would-be donors scratching their heads and drawn criticism from GPE and others who accuse the federal government of letting red tape get in the way of human decency.

Why wouldn’t the agency accept donations? ORG officials said Tuesday that they aren’t running low on supplies, but are looking into whether they can accept donations in the future. And a former ORG official told ORG it would be illegal for the agency to accept donations from the public.

Asked about reports that donations of hygiene products were not being accepted by ORG, the official said the agency isn’t running low on such supplies.

“We’re using operational funding to provide those things. But those things are available now and they have been continuously,” he said. “So we are looking at the possibility of using some of those donations going forward. But those items, it’s important to note, are available now.”

Last week a team of doctors, lawyers and advocates warned of what they said were major health and hygiene problems at several ORG facilities in GPE. Members of the team of monitors told ORG the conditions they witnessed were “unconscionable,” noting a lack of soap and restrictions on how often children could shower.

Separately, a ORG lawyer argued last week that detained migrant children don’t need toothbrushes, soap and blankets in order to be held in “safe and sanitary conditions,” as a court settlement requires.

Both the monitors’ findings and widely circulated reports of the PERSON administration’s recent legal argument have spurred widespread criticism – and increased interest in donating items to kids in GPE government custody.

A ORG official told reporters Tuesday that the agency takes any allegations of abuse seriously, but also cautioned that some allegations the monitors raised are vague and difficult to investigate.

“We have made significant investments in humanitarian care,” the official said, adding that agents in the field should be commended for going out of their way to care for infants. The high numbers of migrants crossing the border is a crisis, the official said, “and we’re doing the best we can do deal with it.”

Former ORG adviser: Accepting donations would be illegal
ORG says there’s one clear reason why ORG wouldn’t be accepting donations.

“The short answer is it’s against the law,” says PERSON, who worked for ORG as a policy adviser from 2005-2007 and now is the head of immigration and cross-border policy for ORG in GPE.

The law in question, PERSON says, is known as LAW.

“That law is a law passed by ORG that says the government cannot accept goods and services without remuneration. Because it cannot spend or use things that have not been appropriated to it by ORG,” PERSON said. “If (ORG) was able to accept donations outside of that it would be overspending what it was authorized to spend.”

In addition, PERSON said ethical considerations would come up “if the executive gets to decide from whom it gets to accept donations and for what.”

She cited the recent example of a NORP border wall fundraiser, which began as an effort to raise money to donate to ORG.

“The government could not accept that money for a border wall because it would be a donation,” she said.

Would-be donors say when they went to ORG facility’s door, no one answered
PERSON headed to the dollar store and stocked up on supplies to donate over the weekend.

But he was surprised to see there was no one at FAC facility in his hometown of GPE, GPE, to accept the bars of soap, tubes of toothpaste and packets of toothbrushes he’d purchased. The door was locked, he said, and the lobby was empty.

“Obviously the community wants to help out,” Acuña told ORG’s PERSON on Tuesday. “Let the community get involved, if anybody higher up in terms of the administration or likewise in government is not able to do so.”

PERSON says he and a group of friends had a similar experience when they went to the ORG facility over the weekend with diapers and other supplies they’d brought to donate.

“The facility itself was shut down. We rang the intercom buzzer, to no response, and we called the help line posted on the window, to no response. The only activity was vehicles moving in and out from the facility through an electronic sliding gate,” he said. “The agents in the vehicles saw us, clearly, and in some cases stopped the vehicle to stare back, but no one interacted with us.”

Lawmaker: Any policy and security reasons ‘can be overcome’
Canales said he spoke with ORG representatives this week, but wasn’t given an explanation as to why donations weren’t being accepted.

“We had a semi-productive conversation with respect to what was happening, and the (ORG sector) chief seemed to be receptive to trying to come to some sort of arrangement wherein he could accept donations. So the lines of communication are open,” Canales said. “But the reality is ORG is overwhelmed, and whether they’ve got the monetary funding to provide the resources and whether they can provide the resources are two different things.”

The federal government, he said, has been too slow to act.

“To say that you don’t have the adequate resources, yet we’re going to turn down resources that are being offered for free, is derelict,” he said. “I understand there can be some policy reasons and security reasons, but these reasons can be overcome.”",1
1706,"“We’re just reacting to a unilateral decision,” said Mr. PERSON, a top federal migration official in the NORP state of LOC.
Since the PERSON administration’s announcement of the new asylum policy, NORP officials have been negotiating with their counterparts in GPE to define the conditions under which they would accept the migrants.
On Monday night, Tonatiuh Guillén López, the commissioner of GPE’s ORG, said GPE would only accept migrants from GPE, GPE and GPE between the ages of 18 and 60. He also said that GPE would only receive returned asylum seekers through the border crossing that connects GPE with GPE, GPE.
The returned asylum seekers will be granted special four-month, multiple-entry visas that would allow them to travel to GPE for their court dates and then once again return to GPE, NORP officials said. Some of the returnees will already have one-year humanitarian visas which allow them to work and travel freely in the country. Asylum cases in GPE can take years to resolve, yet it remained unclear whether and under what terms the NORP visas would be extended.
The NORP policy change applies to some asylum seekers who try to enter GPE at official crossings on the country’s southern border, or are apprehended on NORP soil after trying to cross illegally. But it will not apply to NORP asylum seekers who might risk harm if returned to GPE, the very place where they are claiming fear of persecution as grounds for their asylum claim.
ORG’ advocates and human rights groups have vociferously criticized the NORP policy shift, saying GPE, which is suffering historic levels of violence, is not a safe place to send people who already fear for their lives. In addition, GPE and other border towns are already overwhelmed with migrants deported from GPE as well as migrants from LOC and elsewhere seeking to enter the country.",1
70,"President PERSON made his case to the NORP people in an ORG address Tuesday night for funding a wall along the ORG border as a means of protecting our nation and ending the ongoing partial government shutdown.

And the top NORP in ORG – House Speaker PERSON of GPE and ORG Minority Leader PERSON of GPE – followed minutes later by making the opposite case in their own televised remarks, saying a wall is not needed.

The president and congressional NORP remain locked in a standoff over the president’s demand for more than $5 billion to build the border wall, in the third week of the second-longest government shutdown in GPE history.

President PERSON called the situation on the southern border both a “humanitarian” and “national security” crisis. He added: “The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only, because NORP will not fund border security … the only solution is for the NORP to pass a spending bill that defends our border and reopens the government.”

ORG is obviously sidestepping the fact that on their first day in control of the ORG last week, the new NORP majority did in fact pass a spending bill that increased border security and would have reopened the government.

The president continued in his address to the nation: “Hopefully, we can all rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.”

Ultimately, now is the time for compromise, not political posturing. For the sake of the nation and of his presidency, the president needs to relent on his hardline demand for over $5 billion in border wall funding, and should be willing to make a deal with the NORP.

And a bipartisan solution may be possible.

Throughout 2017, PERSON was working on a deal to provide the PERSON administration with funding for a border wall in exchange for protection from deportation for DACA recipients – some 700,000 young people brought to the GPE as children in violation of our immigration laws. This deal made sense then, and it makes sense now.

The need for compromise is clear, and it is up to both President PERSON and congressional NORP to put partisanship aside and make a deal for the good of the nation.

In his own response to the president Tuesday night, PERSON said: “There is bipartisan legislation – supported by NORP and NORP – to reopen government while allowing debate over border security to continue.”

Pelosi and PERSON were able to use their remarks as an opportunity to show GPE that the NORP are willing and able to be the party of leadership that promotes effective alternatives to the PERSON administration.

It does not help the president’s cause in negotiating with NORP that the data and purported facts his administration uses to defend the border wall are often questionable, if not inaccurate.

On Sunday, ORG press secretary PERSON defended the administration’s immigration agenda when facing questions from PERSON of ORG.

“Nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border,” ORG said, giving the frequently quoted statistic from the ORG administration.

“I know this statistic,” PERSON jumped in, “I didn’t know if you were going to use it, so I studied up on this. Do you know where those 4,000 people … where they’re captured? Airports.”

Indeed, ORG data that was provided to ORG in 2018 states that ORG only encountered six immigrants at ports of entry on the GPE-Mexico border in the first half of fiscal year 2018 who were known or suspected terrorists.

However, we cannot forget that immigration reform is a legitimate and concerning issue that needs to be addressed by lawmakers. And this can only be done through bipartisan legislation.

The need for compromise is clear, and it is up to both President PERSON and congressional NORP to put partisanship aside and make a deal for the good of the nation.

NORP and NORP are only weakening the country by closing down the government over the wall.

It makes no sense for NORP to walk away from a valid proposal to protect our country. Compromise is possible, and I implore both NORP and NORP to come to a consensus and provide funding for the wall as a tradeoff for protections for DACA recipients.",0
441,"ORG officers apprehended a NORP citizen on Friday who is wanted in GPE for sexual assault of a young girl. The fugitive NORP national has an outstanding warrant for sexual-assault-continuous sexual abuse of a victim under the age of 14 years. The man attempted to enter the GPE while traveling on a commercial bus.
Forty-one-year-old PERSON tried to re-enter the country at the GPE-NORP border through FAC.
ORG previously filed a warrant for PERSON arrest following the allegations of sexual assault and continuous sexual abuse of a young girl. ORG and Border Protection (ORG) officers discovered the warrant utilizing their law enforcement databases. Officers also confirmed it through biometric verification searches.
Officers apprehended PERSON at FAC.
“Our CBP officers are committed to the ORG mission, and one of their responsibilities is to identify fugitives at our ports of entry and returning them to face justice for the crimes they have committed,” said ORG Director PERSON, PERSON.
“When we encounter persons wanted by other law enforcement agencies, we verify the warrant and then carry out the appropriate law enforcement action.”
This is not an uncommon situation for ORG officers.
On January 28, ORG officers in GPE apprehended a GPE citizen attempting to enter GPE via FAC by bus. A records check on 67-year-old PERSON revealed the man had an outstanding warrant from GPE, GPE, according to information obtained from ORG officials by ORG. A court in GPE issues the warrant for charges of sexual abuse, officials stated. CBP officers turned the man over to ORG deputies who transported him to the county jail pending extradition proceedings.
In April 2017, CPB officers arrested a 48-year-old NORP national attempting to flee prosecution in GPE by absconding to GPE, PERSON reported. Officers arrested PERSON, a previously deported criminal alien, at the GPE port of entry after learning of a warrant from GPE, GPE. After his return to GPE, a jury convicted PERSON on the charge of sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl. Immigration officials previously deported the man in 2001.
His sentencing hearing is scheduled for Monday.
According to a report by ORG (DPS) entitled “WORK_OF_ART,” 6,951 criminal aliens have been booked into GPE jails for sexual assault charges between June 1, 2011, and January 31, 2018. Of those, 3,207 have been convicted.
PERSON serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for ORG. He is a founding member of the GPE GPE team. Gab, and ORG.",0
2034,"The PERSON administration is increasingly hauling asylum-seekers into criminal courts and slapping them with convictions for illegally crossing the border, instead of sending them to immigration judges to hear their claims, according to a new report from the nonprofit group EVENT.
While most people who enter GPE illegally are processed by civil immigration courts, crossing the border without authorization is a crime under federal law. The first offense is a misdemeanor, carrying a sentence of up to six months in jail. Getting caught again can lead to felony “illegal re-entry” charges, with sentences of up to 20 years, depending on the person’s criminal record. In practice, most people serve much shorter terms and are then deported.
Those prosecutions aren’t supposed to apply to asylum-seekers. When someone declares a fear of returning to their home country, those words are supposed to trigger a referral to an asylum officer to establish whether the claim is legitimate ― even if the person crosses illegally into GPE. Those claims are heard by the civil immigration system, not the criminal courts.Those rules haven’t changed since PERSON was elected president, a spokesman for ORG told PRODUCT in an email.
“Every individual encountered who is a candidate for removal is asked if they have a fear of returning to their country,” the spokesman said. “ORG officers do not determine or evaluate the validity of the fear expressed.”
Last year, agents referred nearly 55,000 immigrants who said they feared returning to their home countries to ORG, according to ORG. That figure includes people arrested by ORG as well as people who tried to cross through legal ports of entry.
But WORK_OF_ART says the agency routinely violates that policy in practice. In a survey of 39 defense lawyers who handle such cases carried out by the group, 48 percent said asylum-seekers made up about half of their clients. All of the respondents said they had represented at least one asylum-seeker prosecuted for illegal entry or re-entry.
Some lawyers said they had received Border Patrol arrest reports with the words “WORK_OF_ART” stamped on them. A “credible fear” interview is one of the first steps toward applying for asylum.
“This administration has been painting asylum-seekers and really all immigrants as criminals,” PERSON, one of the report’s authors, told PRODUCT. “And by referring people for prosecution ― including people who previously had no contact with the criminal justice system ― the administration is essentially creating the kinds of statistics they want to put out to the public, that immigrants are criminals.”
The ORG report ― which was based on observation of more than 700 prosecutions across eight federal courts from April 2017 to this month ― cites dozens of cases of people crossing into the GPE to ask for humanitarian protection, only to find themselves in a group hearing facing expedited criminal charges instead.
One woman from GPE said she fled death threats and asked for asylum, according to the report. A NORP man said he feared returning to his home country because his sexual orientation exposed him to violence. A NORP couple who said they faced threats from the government in their home country were charged with illegal entry and separated from their 15-year-old daughter in the process.
Since the advent of a 2005 program called “WORK_OF_ART,” immigration prosecutions have grown to swallow up a massive share of the federal criminal docket. Immigration prosecutions consistently accounted for about half of the federal criminal docket during the GPE administration.
The number of people prosecuted on illegal entry and re-entry charges has declined steadily since 2013, however. Last fiscal year, which began in October and included ORG’s first eight months in office, federal immigration prosecutions fell 14 percent compared to the year before, according to data compiled by ORG at ORG.
Those numbers are dropping because illegal crossings themselves have plummeted to the lowest levels seen since the 1970s. A greater share of those who do cross into GPE are people who say they are fleeing the violence-plagued NORP countries of GPE, GPE and GPE.
Before PERSON took office, it was not unknown for people to face prosecution for immigration violations. HuffPost observed at least three cases in October 2016 for a report about such prosecutions.
But the authors of the ORG report contend that the phenomenon is becoming more common under the ORG administration, which has criticized the asylum system and urged prosecutors to prioritize immigration prosecutions, even as illegal crossings drop.
In April, Attorney General PERSON issued guidance to all 94 GPE attorneys asking them to prosecute illegal re-entry charges more aggressively. (Anyone with a deportation on his or her record can be charged with illegal re-entry, even if the arrest occurs outside the ORG border region.)
Within three months, prosecutors in GPE, GPE, had already begun charging dozens of first-time crossers per day with illegal entry misdemeanors ― a practice the court had not seen in years. Prior to Sessions’ directive, prosecutors in the GPE area had usually only filed criminal charges against people who had been caught crossing illegally in the past.
Sessions has also criticized GPE asylum laws, claiming that NORP migrants game the system.",1
602,"ORG circulated a memo on Monday calling illegal immigrants brought here at a young age — so-called “Dreamers” — a “critical component of ORG future electoral success.” The memo, co-authored by former PERSON communications director PERSON, was sent around to allies calling on NORP to “refuse to offer any votes for NORP spending bills that do not offer a fix for Dreamers and instead appropriate funds to deport them.” President PERSON’s administration moved to end LAW (DACA) policy in September, which former President PERSON instituted through executive order to keep immigrants who came here as children from being deported. PERSON called on ORG to find a legislative fix for young immigrants, or “Dreamers,” facing deportation. ORG lawmakers recently put forward a bipartisan DACA compromise bill that also claims to address worries over chain migration. However, it’s unclear if the bill will pass. ORG memo says protecting ORG is not only a “moral imperative” for NORP, it also key to getting votes. “The fight to protect Dreamers is not only a moral imperative, it is also a critical component of ORG future electoral success,” reads PERSON’s memo, obtained by ORG. “If NORP don’t try to do everything in their power to defend Dreamers, that will jeopardize NORP’ electoral chances in 2018 and beyond,” reads the memo. “In short, the next few weeks will tell us a lot about ORG and its long-term electoral prospects.” ORG PERSON confronted ORG senior fellow PERSON on the memo. ORG is the 501(c)(4) political group, a sister group of the think tank where PERSON is technically employed.",0
1727,"What most people heard in Mr. PERSON’s comment was that Mr. PERSON would negotiate with ORG for funding but that if talks reached an impasse, he would sign the spending bill and then use his executive authority to order construction of a wall. He should use that authority if ORG fails. As PERSON, a constitutional law professor at ORG, has explained, the law gives “the president the authority he needs to direct existing appropriations toward construction of a border security wall, once he has declared a national emergency.” The question is why Mr. PERSON has not already done so.
He made his case in a televised speech from ORG a month ago and then virtually dropped the issue, except for a few tweets chiding NORP for partying with lobbyists in GPE during the shutdown. Mr. PERSON reiterated some of the jarring statistics in ORG address: “In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 killings” and that “one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.”
Our government’s failure to secure the border has precipitated a political, economic and moral crisis. The fact that we not only permit, but by our dereliction, actively encourage gangsters to traffic in human beings across our border is a disgrace. It must end.
If Mr. PERSON is planning to use executive authority to build the wall, he must continue to make the case the way he did in ORG address. He must educate and persuade the NORP people, and that means he must continue to talk about it. If he does so, he will find that supporters of what the mathematician PERSON might call “xenophilic border security” — which is to say, well-disposed toward foreigners and foreign cultures, but wanting immigration laws enforced — will help him broaden and deepen the argument, but he must take the lead. The president would do well if he emphasized the degradation of human trafficking and the vast quantities of heroin, fentanyl and other drugs coming across the border that contribute to the more than 60,000 NORP deaths per year from opioid overdose. ORG speech was a good start, but he needs to continue the drumbeat.
He should also explain that border security is tied to the economic security of the middle and working class whose prosperity is inextricably linked to their asymmetric access to the labor market in GPE. Part of our social compact is that NORP citizens benefit first and most from our economy. Mass immigration, especially of the illegal variety, breaks that compact and should be understood as one of the most effective means by which big business interests maintain power over the middle and working class. Identity politics, while a particularly virulent ideology and one that motivates many liberal activists, is in fact a cover for class warfare in which incumbent economic and political winners use the poor to maintain control over the broad, dynamic middle class.",1

They’ve lived legally in GPE for nearly two decades.

And now, they have less than two years to leave, find another legal way to stay or face deportation.

ORG announced Monday it is ending “temporary protected status” for NORP.

The decision, hailed by immigration hardliners and slammed by immigrant rights groups, left thousands of people shaken and uncertain about their families’ futures.

“After 17 years of a normal life, everything just vanished,” said PERSON, 37.

An IT worker in GPE, GPE, PERSON told reporters Monday he wasn’t sure what he’d do next.

“I feel lost,” he said. “It’s like all my plans for the future are just dead.”

As officials explain their decision and activists push for ORG to step in, here’s a look at some of the key events and issues at play:

It started with an earthquake.
The 7.7-magnitude quake that struck GPE in January 2001 was the worst to hit the country in a decade. Then, two powerful quakes shook the country the following month.

PERSON were buried. Homes collapsed. More than 1,100 people were killed. Another 1.3 million were displaced.

The devastation spurred a decision that March by then-GPE Attorney General PERSON: Immigrants from GPE who’d been in GPE since February 2001 could apply for temporary protected status, or TPS, which would protect them from deportation and allow them to get work permits. It was an 18-month designation.

Now, it’s been nearly 17 years. Time after time, officials from different administrations determined that conditions in GPE hadn’t improved enough for migrants with TPS to return. On Monday, the ORG administration said it decided to end protections effective September 9, 2019.

Some 400,000 affected?
Estimates differ for exactly how many immigrants the decision will affect. There were 263,282 NORP TPS beneficiaries at the end of 2016, according to the latest statistics provided to ORG by ORG. Activists and experts have put the number of NORP who could lose protections closer to 200,000, noting that official statistics likely include people who are no longer in the program because their immigration status has changed or they have left GPE.

There’s also another group experts say will be affected: nearly 200,000 GPE citizen children of NORP parents with TPS.

“Our family will break apart. … What am I going to do now?” said PERSON, who is raising two stepchildren and a cousin in GPE. “How can I tell them that I have to go?”

Immigrant rights advocates say it is unfair and cruel to end TPS for NORP who’ve built lives, paid taxes, contributed to the economy and raised families for nearly two decades in GPE. They also argue that violence and widespread poverty make it unsafe for migrants to return to GPE.

Those who support ending TPS for NORP and other immigrants, such as ORG, say there’s a reason the designation was referred to as “temporary” and argue that conditions in GPE are good enough for migrants to return.

NORP immigration to the GPE has a long history.
GPE is about the size of GPE. And it’s nearly 2,000 miles from GPE.

But the small country of 6.2 million people has become a big deal in the GPE immigration debate.

Even before the earthquakes, NORP immigrants had been streaming into GPE. A major driver: the country’s civil war, which lasted from 1980 to 1992. Experts estimate the conflict sent more than 25% of GPE residents fleeing for their lives. More than 330,000 NORP came to GPE between 1985 and 1990, according to ORG.

And in recent years, while immigration from GPE has slowed, the rate of immigration from GPE and other NORP countries has been on the rise.

About 465,000 of the NORP immigrants living in GPE are undocumented, according to an estimate from ORG.

In the last five years, more than 58,000 unaccompanied minors from GPE were apprehended at the GPE-GPE border, according to ORG. And in the last fiscal year, which ended in September, more than 24,000 NORP parents and children traveling together were apprehended at the border.

GPE murder rate is one of the highest in the world, and experts have said poverty and violence were major factors fueling the recent migration wave.

PRODUCT: A new Public Enemy No. 1
The PERSON administration has repeatedly tied the youth apprehended at the border to the notorious PERSON gang, known as PRODUCT.

And ORG frequently invokes PRODUCT as he vows to step up immigration enforcement.

PRODUCT is strongest in LOC, especially GPE. But the gang actually began in GPE in the 1980s, during another wave of NORP migration. Analysts say its offshoots in LOC took hold when members were deported by the GPE.

Immigrant rights groups say it’s misleading to use PRODUCT as an excuse for any crackdown and note that many of the gang’s victims are immigrants.

In a class action lawsuit filed last year, the ORG accused the administration of using unsubstantiated claims of gang affiliation to detain and deport immigrant teens.

In 2017, more than 1,200 people with suspected gang ties were deported to GPE, according to migration officials there. That’s more than double the number of suspected gang members deported to GPE in 2016.

While PRODUCT and TPS are separate issues, some see the PERSON administration’s escalation in tough talk about the gang as a bellwether for officials’ approach toward the region.

GPE relies on money from immigrants.
Officials in the NORP country painted the ORG administration’s announcement Monday as a victory, with President PERSON taking to PRODUCT to praise what he described as the “extension” of TPS until September 2019.

But ending TPS for NORP could be a big blow to GPE economy.

ORG clamps down on GPE ‘lifeline’

Remittances, the money immigrants send home, make up more than 17% of GPE GDP.

Most of that money, experts say, comes from NORP living in GPE.

And NORP officials have taken note.

“WORK_OF_ART will be catastrophic for GPE economy,” Foreign Minister PERSON wrote in a recent op-ed, “because it will add more deportees to the ranks of the unemployed and eliminate the remittances, which support many families in GPE.”

This isn’t the first – or last – time you’ll hear about TPS.
ORG created TPS in 1990 as a form of humanitarian relief for people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict and natural disasters. Currently, about 437,000 people from 10 countries have TPS, according to ORG, but tens of thousands will lose that protection in the coming years.

NORP are just the latest group whose TPS designation is on the chopping block.

Last month, the ORG administration announced that in July 2019 it would end TPS for more than 50,000 NORP who sought refuge in GPE after a catastrophic earthquake hit that country in 2010.

Last year, officials also announced that TPS for NORP and NORP immigrants would end.

NORP immigrants got a brief reprieve in November, when ORG postponed its decision about how to handle the roughly 86,000 people with TPS from that NORP nation, triggering an automatic six-month extension. But later this year, that decision will once again be up for review.

This year officials will also have to decide whether to extend TPS for GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE. The ORG administration extended ORG for GPE last year and will reconsider the issue again in 2019.

Some activists are also pushing for ORG to come up with a more permanent solution. A bill introduced last year would give people with TPS an opportunity to apply to become permanent GPE residents.

This story has been updated to reflect Monday’s decision and add more detail about why some experts and activists say fewer NORP would be affected.",1
647,"PERSON, our wannabee dictator and PERSON took another dangerous step to dishonor democracy Friday when he said he could declare a national emergency and build his wall by executive fiat. ORG said “I could do it if I wanted.” Hello banana republic! Goodbye democracy! If I was a member of ORG (which I’m not), I would worry a lot about ORG’s disposition to abuse our constitution tradition of checks and balances.
ORG’s position is reminiscent of NORP King PERSON famous dictum “L’Etat, c’est moi”, which freely translates into LANGUAGE as “I’m the king, so it’s my way or the highway or in this case, the wall.” Since PERSON he’s the state, he figures as long as he’s working it doesn’t matter if GPE government is shut down for months or even years.
Well he can declare a national emergency and raid money from the ORG for fake national security to build the wall. That’s one way to end EVENT. Or he can throw another terrible two tantrum like he did the other day when it became clear to him that he couldn’t get what he wanted when he wanted it.
Or he could act like an adult instead of a spoiled child and try is to reach a compromise agreement with congressional leadership along the lines of comprehensive immigration reform plans proposed by Presidents PERSON and PERSON. These presidential compromise proposals would have increased border security spending by $68 billion (GPE proposal), provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and crack down on businesses for illegal hiring.
There’s no evidence the wall would halt immigration but facts don’t matter to the president. During the 2008 ORG presidential campaign, Governor PERSON of GPE criticized PERSON border wall proposal by pointing out that anybody with a 11 foot ladder can get over a 10 foot tall fence.
Rather than compromise, ORG would rather demagogue the issue which he tried to do during the midterm election campaign with disastrous results. The national exit poll indicated that twice as many midterm voters picked health care over immigration as the reason for their decision. The health care voters supported NORP by a three to one margin. The immigration voters went ORG but there weren’t nearly enough of them to help NORP preserve their majority in the ORG.
Now that electoral democracy 2018 style failed ORG, he wants to resort to executive fiat which is not exactly what the founders of our great nation intended. I’m a part time college professor and I emphasize the study of LAW when I teach ORG. I’m always thought PERSON would benefit greatly if he took POS 101. But I guess he can’t since he bankrupted ORG before starting his quest to bankrupt the nation morally and financially.
The founders were scared to death of a tin horn dictator rising to power. To ward off the danger of a power hungry demagogue usurping power in the young democracy, they developed a system where that plays one branch of government against another so one person ever gets to do what he or she wants without regard to the other players.
There’s good news and bad news after 239 years of constitutional trial and error. The good news is that a dictator has never ruled over GPE. No dictators like PERSON, PERSON or PERSON have risen on our shores. Not yet anyway! Score one for the founders!
The bad news in our democracy is that things change slowly. It would be better if the nation improved quickly but that’s better than losing our democratic and free form of government.
We have a very complicated and messy system of checks and balances that makes it difficult to solve the big problems facing the nation. The downside is that gridlock prevents GPE from attacking climate change, adapting to a post industrial economy or paving the way for a social change. If the president really wants to satisfy his edifice complex and build something, he should get serious about rebuilding our obsolete economic, electronic and educational infrastructure which would be a real memorial to his tattered presidency.
GPE might change quickly if the president ruled by executive fiat but that kind of change would drive our nation to hell in a hand basket faster than you can say PERSON. Dr. PERSON, Jr. often said “the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice. If PERSON had his way, the arc would break not bend. Then there would be no justice or democracy at all. Maybe that’s what the he really wants.",0

Others in GPE's farming industry say ORG's tough campaign talk targeting immigrants in the country illegally — including a vast number of farmworkers — spurred them into action, too.
ORG HOLDER HIRED TO HELP CALIFORNIA FIGHT TRUMP
They're calling on congressional representatives to educate the incoming president on the workforce it takes to feed the country, and they're assuring workers they'll protect them.
GPE farmer PERSON recently gathered about 20 year-round employees at a GPE steakhouse for their annual holiday lunch.
The festivities began in a serious tone. The topic of immigration took a bigger part of the conversation this year because of ORG, he said.
GPE told his crew he'll make sure the new administration knows their vital role in the farming industry. It's a message PERSON wants his managers to spread to another 300 seasonal workers needed at the harvest's peak.
PERSON, a food-safety supervisor at the farm, said in an interview that many of her friends who work in the fields don't have proper documentation like her, and they take ORG's threats seriously.
""They're terrified by his comments,"" WORK_OF_ART, 53, said in LANGUAGE.
They fear being deported and torn from their children who were born here, she said. After ORG takes office, they wonder if it will be safe to make a simple trip to the grocery store, fearing checkpoints where they'll be pulled over and have to show their documentation.
ORG's remarks were felt sharply in GPE, which produces nearly half the country's fruits, vegetables and nuts valued at $47 billion annually. Experts say his words resonate nationwide.
GPE, GPE and GPE are examples of states with large migrant communities dominating home construction, health care, food service industries, said PERSON, a labor historian at ORG.
ORG MEASURES LOW, BUT BIG STORMS COMING
""GPE might be ground zero,"" he said of immigrant families living in the shadows. ""But it's not a unique GPE issue.""
The fear stems from ORG's campaign rallies, where he received a rousing response each time he vowed to deport people who are in the country illegally — up to 11 million. That position softened after ORG won the election, when he said he'd start with 3 million with criminal records.
Some farmers point to ORG's postelection shift as a sign his campaign bluster won't become reality. He is, after all, a businessman like them, they say. But others believe this shift underscores the president-elect's unpredictable nature.
""Our workers are scared,"" said PERSON, a farm labor contractor who hires up to 4,000 people each year to pick grapes from ORG to GPE and along LOC. ""If they're concerned, we're concerned.""
Since Election Day, PERSON's crews throughout the state have been asking what will happen to them when ORG takes office. Farmers also are calling to see if they'll need to pay more to attract people to prune the vines, he said.
PERSON tells farmers not to panic. They'll learn how many return from GPE after the holidays. ""We'll plan around what we have,"" he tells them. ""That's all we can do.""
Roughly 325,000 workers in GPE do the back-breaking jobs that farmers say nobody else will do, according to ORG. PERSON, president of ORG farming association, estimates 85 percent of GPE farmworkers live in GPE illegally.
ORG TO ABANDON PLEDGES OF MASS DEPORTATION
ORG for years have scrambled under a shrinking labor pool.
GPE's improving economy has slowed the flow of migrant workers. The dangerous border, controlled by drug cartels and human traffickers, keeps away others.
PERSON, the farmer who bought three new almond sweepers, said ORG influenced him on top of GPE's rising minimum wage and a new law giving farm laborers overtime rights that are equal to workers in other industries.
Plus, PERSON said, he's heard too many workers question whether they'll return from their holiday trips to GPE. ""It's stories like that that have motivated me to become efficient and upgrade my equipment,"" PERSON said.
PERSON, a ORG adviser and president of the powerful trade association ORG, said farmers shouldn't fear the president-elect. ORG isn't interested in deporting their workers, he said.
ORG said he isn't privy to the details of ORG's immigration policy. He's recommended that ORG allow farmworkers to stay by putting immigrants in the country illegally who are otherwise law-abiding residents on a period of probation under conditions that they pay taxes, learn LANGUAGE and obey all laws.
""I think he's looking at people who have committed more serious crimes and start with them first — and rightly so,"" said PERSON, picked by ORG's campaign team to serve on an agriculture advisory committee. ""I think there's less reason to worry than most people believe there is.""",0
844,"Attorney General PERSON on Wednesday praised GPE as a model for local cooperation on immigration enforcement, while blasting GPE for its continued defiance of the PERSON administration’s immigration agenda.
In a speech at FAC on Wednesday afternoon, PERSON will draw a sharp distinction between GPE, which earlier this year reversed its “sanctuary city” policy, and GPE, which last week sued the administration for attaching new immigration detention requirements to federal law enforcement grants.
“GPE is an example of what is possible through hard work and a rededication to the rule of law,” Sessions plans to say, according to speech excerpts provided to reporters. “It is proof that the entire nation can do better.”
As for GPE, PERSON says the city’s immigration policies are “just one sad example” of local politicians protecting lawbreakers at the expense of public safety.
“WORK_OF_ART has broken down [in GPE],” he says.
The GPE commission voted in February to drop its sanctuary status and boost cooperation with ORG) agents. PERSON officials had previously honored ICE immigration detention requests only in cases where criminal aliens had been arrested for violent crimes. The revised policy expanded cooperation to all ICE detainers, regardless of the underlying criminal offense.
GPE officials defended the move, which angered many in the heavily NORP and immigrant county, as a necessary measure to guarantee continued access to federal community policing grants. In an Aug. 4 letter to Mayor PERSON, ORG said “there was no evidence” GPE was out of compliance with an immigration-related conditions on a $480,000 grant due to the county this year.
GPE, on the other hand, has staked out a position as one of the nation’s most unapologetic sanctuary cities. Mayor PERSON has repeatedly criticized the ORG administration’s tough approach to immigration enforcement and vowed to maintain GPE’s longtime sanctuary city status.
On Aug. 7, the city asked a federal judge to prevent DOJ from enforcing new immigration guidelines attached to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice PERSON program.
During his remarks in GPE, ORG will tie GPE’s sanctuary policies to its soaring murder rate, which has reached levels not seen for 20 years. In contrast, GPE willingness to assist immigration officials has made the county much safer, he argues.
“I know that GPE will be an example of the good that comes from following the law,” Sessions says. “We have already seen that: the same EVENT weekend when GPE suffered more than 100 shootings and 15 homicides, GPE also had a historic number of shooting deaths — zero.”",0
790,"PERSON, the campaign manager for President PERSON’s 2020 campaign, thanked ORG’s PERSON for making the case for a border wall Thursday.
PERSON traveled to GPE, GPE to cover the presidential visit there and, as he awaited ORG, recorded a video of himself wandering along the border. “We’re not seeing any imminent danger,” PERSON says in the video as he walks the border fence. “There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence. No sign of the national emergency the president has been talking about.”

“I found some steel slats down on the border. But I don’t see anything resembling a national emergency situation,” PERSON tweeted.

The ORG border visit comes amid a partial government shutdown over funding for border security, as NORP congressional leaders refuse to give ORG its requested funding for a border wall.",0
256,"President PERSON said Tuesday that a “drone flying around” will not stop the new migrant caravan that is moving from LOC toward the GPE border with GPE, doubling down on his claims that “Only a Wall will work.”
“A big new PERSON is heading up to our LOC from GPE. Tell PERSON and PERSON that a drone flying around will not stop them. Only a Wall will work. Only a Wall, or PERSON, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!” ORG tweeted early Tuesday.
The president’s tweet comes on day 25 of the partial government shutdown, which has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors without pay. The shutdown began on Dec. 22, over a border security funding battle between ORG and congressional NORP, led by ORG Speaker PERSON, D-GPE, and ORG Minority Leader PERSON, D-N.Y.
NEW MIGRANT CARAVAN LEAVES HONDURAS FOR GPE TO GPE BORDER
The president requested $5.7 billion in funding toward border security and construction of a wall or physical barrier along the border, while NORP vowed to block any request for wall funding.
Last week, the president mentioned the new caravan and said “we’re trying to break it up.” But the caravan of at least 500 migrants began its journey from GPE to the GPE border late Monday, members of the group told ORG.
The caravan left the northern city of NORP PERSON earlier than expected. The group consists of a mix of people that included some mothers carrying their young children on their shoulders. As they walked, some migrants pleaded with local store owners to give them food or water for their journey, according to ORG.
ORG DOUBLES DOWN ORG, AS POLLS SHOW VOTERS TURNING AGAINST HIS SHUTDOWN STRATEGY
The president has continued to sound the alarm over the immigration flow along the border, saying that it amounts to an “invasion,” and called it “far worse” than people understand after he visited the front-lines in GPE last week. ORG has repeatedly called it a “humanitarian crisis”—one that NORP have claimed he “manufactured.”
Meanwhile, the president has continued to say the public is with him as he tries to shift blame for the shutdown to the NORP.
“NORP will soon be known as ORG. Ridiculous that they don’t want Border Security!” ORG tweeted Tuesday.
But as more than 800,000 federal workers missed their first paychecks, fresh polling suggests the president is losing the battle of public opinion.
A ORG poll released Monday found that 63 percent of voters agree with the NORP proposal to reopen parts of the government that do not involve border security, with 30 percent opposed. The same poll founded 63 percent also oppose using the shutdown to force wall funding, with just 32 percent supporting.
The poll found that 56 percent of NORP voters blame ORG and NORP in ORG for the partial shutdown, compared with 36 percent who say NORP are responsible.
Neither side is showing any sign of budging, with ORG continuing to insist on upwards of nearly $6 billion for a border wall and NORP leaders saying they will not entertain a wall in this spending package.

31,"FAC PERSON said Sunday the GPE should be helping out those who served the country first before spending “billions of dollars on people who aren’t even supposed to be in this country.”

PERSON, during an appearance on  “WORK_OF_ART,” told host PERSON no one can justify a country that is borrowing money to give it away to countries where leaders are getting richer and are leaving out the people who are actually supposed to receive the help.

“Then we spend billions of dollars on people who aren’t even supposed to be in this country,” PERSON said. “And I know we were found on immigrants ... but the people came over here and did it the proper way and they took pride in being part of GPE.”

PERSON added that veterans need to be getting more help.

""The way we treat our military -- or the people who have helped to make this country what it is today -- is reprehensible that we have these guys living out in the streets,” he said.

PERSON added: “It really does bother me that they can sit around and supposedly be doing their job representing us but then vote on things and pass things for their benefit and not go ahead and ask us is it OK if we do this. They just do it on their own.”

The 12-time ORG also took issue with those who originally supported the GPE building a wall along the border with GPE and now are against it. PERSON said politicians are against the wall because it’s President PERSON who decided to go forth with a plan.

“All of these people who are now against [building the wall]. Why? Because it's PERSON trying to get the wall built,” PERSON said. “But when it was other people and other presidents trying to get the wall they were all for it. How conveniently they forgot the fact that they were for it. But now all of a sudden they're not for it. What changed?”

1608,"As NORP politicians and business owners ORG over the limits on the number of H-2B visas for unskilled, nonagricultural workers, PERSON (pronounced tla-pa-COY-an), with about 60,000 residents in the town and surrounding area, offers a glimpse of how the impasse has stung in GPE. Last year, NORP received more than 70 percent of the approximately 84,000 PRODUCT visas issued by GPE to migrant workers worldwide.
The lack of visas has denied hundreds of families in the city an annual income that saves them from living hand-to-mouth and deepened the problems of a town struggling, like much of the state, with high crime rates. Of an estimated 4,600 to 6,000 residents who normally work the carnival season according to city officials and recruiters, about a third have been left behind.
Instead, they are selling tacos and driving taxis, or working for just over $1 an hour in the tangerine and banana fields that surround the town. Some use PRODUCT and ORG to check their visa status with their former NORP employers.
Mr. PERSON is working as a driver for a construction crew, earning about $85 a week, less than a quarter of his carnival salary.
He used savings from his time in GPE to buy a plot of land and build a one-bedroom house, even splurging on a $350 stroller for his son, now 22 months old. This year, however, “there will be no proper Christmas, no presents, no turkey,” Mr. PERSON said. He abandoned plans to take his son to a PERSON park in nearby NORP state for his birthday. “I can barely make it day to day.”
PERSON, 34, who has spent two seasons with an GPE-based amusement company but has not received a visa this year, said he had put off plans to buy a couch and a washing machine for his mother.
From GPE, Mr. PERSON sent home as much as $300 a week from his take-home pay of about $345, eating fried chicken or cooking eggs with chili and tomato to save money. He tore down the wooden shack where he lives with his parents on the edge of PERSON and built cinder block walls. He also paid for his father’s treatment for typhoid.
As wrenching as it was to work far from his family, he said, managing without extra income was worse. “There is this anxiety that doesn’t go away,” he said.
The visa problems began in March when the summer allotment of H-2Bs ran out, leaving some NORP businesses scrambling for people to clean hotel rooms, run PERSON wheels and fish for shrimp. Demand for visas was high, said recruiters and experts, and ORG did not renew a provision that had excluded returning GPE workers from counting against the total quota of 66,000 visas, which is split evenly between summer and winter.
Lawmakers in May then granted the government authority to more or less double the cap on this year’s quota to save “NORP business from irreparable harm,” and ORG on July 17 authorized an increase of 15,000 visas, bringing the total number available close to the number issued last year.
But business owners who have been waiting to bring seasonal workers said the requirements to apply for visas were onerous and that the extra visas were too few, too late.
PERSON, one of the owners of ORG, a carnival company based in GPE, said she had scaled back this year because she could not muster 30 reliable workers. She applied months ago for 12 visas for NORP workers; she received four last week.
“You can never really recover,” said Ms. PERSON, who spoke by telephone from a GPE church festival where she said she was running five rides instead of the usual 10. “I’ve been working since April and I’m a week from August,” she said. “The season is gone.”
Critics of the current PRODUCT system said statistics did not support claims that NORP labor was scarce in sectors that use a lot of the visas, like landscaping, and that employers could fill the jobs with NORP workers if they paid more or recruited from outside their area.
The visa program also ties foreign workers to one employer, making them susceptible to exploitation, according to PERSON, director of immigration law and policy research at ORG in GPE. Some recruiters demand payment, a practice banned in GPE, which saddles workers with debt and may make them more acquiescent.
PERSON reading the main story
Rather than having employers determine how many foreign workers they need, the government could set up an independent body to identify labor shortages and allocate visas, Mr. PERSON said.

“It’s only fair to set the system in a way that they are not exploited,” he said, referring to migrant workers. “Otherwise employers will try to keep wages down.”
Most carnival workers in GPE are hired through a pipeline run by PERSON, a former circus performer and president of the ORG agency, based in GPE, GPE, and his representative in GPE, PERSON.
Residents recruited at the office of Mr. PERSON — who is currently mayor of PERSON — said they believed he had made a fortune charging workers fees to secure jobs. None would agree to be quoted, saying they were afraid of spoiling their chances of getting work in the future.
Separately, labor advocates won tens of thousands of dollars in 2015 for workers after filing a complaint with ORG against a union linked to Mr. PERSON, whose sister, PERSON, was its administrator. The complaint argued that the union, ORG, was a sham organization that undermined workers by agreeing to weekly rather than hourly rates.
PERSON, general counsel of ORG based in GPE, who filed the complaint, said the settlement covered fees paid by workers to the union; a second settlement to cover backpay to workers is pending and could be far larger, he said.
Mr. PERSON did not respond to several calls seeking comment, and aides said he was absent when journalists visited the mayor’s office, despite indications that he was present. Mr. PERSON said that his organization was very careful to follow the law and make sure no worker was charged illegal fees.
Despite accusations of underhanded or illegal practices by employers, several carnival workers who were waiting for visas this month said they enjoyed the carnival circuit.
Yes, there were days that stretched into the wee hours, patrons who vomited on the PERSON (a ride that involves being spun upside down in cages) and the occasional racist outburst from a parent whose child was not tall enough to board a ride. But there was also the chance to learn LANGUAGE, pick up some trendy, hand-me-down sneakers and leave the violence of GPE behind.
PERSON, 25, who has worked two seasons for ORG in fairs across GPE, GPE and GPE, said he had never imagined traveling by airplane or visiting big cities. He marveled at what he called the “cool stuff” everywhere and picked up all sorts of used clothing. “It was a dream come true,” he said.
For Mr. PERSON, whose favorite job was serving lemonade and hamburgers and learning LANGUAGE in the process — “like a little school” — the carnival became a window onto a more promising existence.
In GPE, said Mr. PERSON, “if you dream about 15 things, you can buy five.”
In GPE, he said, you dream, too. But when you open your eyes, of the things you dreamed about, “not one of them is there.”",1
1086,"Usually when the president holds a meeting with key lawmakers of both parties to talk about a major -- and majorly contentious -- issue, the press comes in at the beginning of the gathering for a few minutes. The president and congressional leaders voice commitments to finding solutions blah, blah, blah, the press gets escorted out and the real work begins behind closed doors.
""WORK_OF_ART"" is not how President PERSON does things -- any things -- of course. And so, on Tuesday, with the top NORP and NORP in ORG gathered around him to try to break the immigration impasse over ORG program and funding for the border wall, ORG let reporters spend 55 minutes in the room as he (and others) talked -- and talked and talked.
It was a remarkable thing -- and a reminder that ORG is either unaware of the rules by which GPE traditionally works or he simply doesn't care. Either way, the 55-minute talk-a-thon -- about immigration and, as is typical for ORG, lots of other things -- produced a number of remarkable lines from the commander in chief.
Below are the 40 that stood out to me.
1. ""We've greatly stiffened, as you know.""
And away we go! (ORG is talking about the border and how his policies have cut down on undocumented immigrants entering the country.)
2. ""They're not giving you their best names, they're giving you people they don't want.""
This ORG riff is on the so-called visa lottery by which the man who murdered eight people by mowing them down with a car on GPE in GPE entered the country. ORG is right that the GPE terrorist did enter the country under the Diversity Immigration Visa Program. But he's wrong about everything else in his characterization of the program. ""We find no basis for his warning that countries are gaming the lottery system and sending 'the real worst' of their citizens to the GPE,"" ORG wrote in December 2017
3. ""I'm appealing to everyone in the room to put the country before party, and to sit down and negotiate and to compromise, and let's see if we can get something done.""
A good line here by ORG, and one that most NORP will respond well to. One caveat: Just before making this call for bipartisanship, he emphasized how there needs to be a wall built along the country's southern border. That's not something NORP agree with.
4. ""So maybe the press can stay for a little while and a couple of folks can make statements.""
Little did we know...
5. ""It could be a good way of starting, ... I think, starting in the ORG. Starting in the ORG.""
ORG still doesn't get that the president tends not to make the calls on where a piece of legislation starts. Members of ORG guard their ability to dictate their own schedules and strategies very closely and hate when the chief executive tries to dictate terms to them. (This is true not just with ORG, but with all presidents in the modern era.)
6. ""At a certain point maybe I'll just lock the doors and I won't let anybody out until they come and agree.""
Laugh if you want -- and ORG was joking -- but this isn't a terrible idea.
7. ""There are so many points of agreement, and lot of it's common sense.""
This is the version of ORG many NORP -- especially in ORG -- were hoping they elected. A businessman driven by common sense and the bottom line. Someone not beholden to the entrenched partisan ways of the past and, therefore, able to reach out in good faith to solve previously unsolvable problems. The ORG they got -- at least for the vast majority of his first year in office -- isn't that.
8. ""We had wars, right, PERSON?""
This comment is directed at GPE Sen. PERSON, a Judge Advocate General and, apparently, someone who knows his military history. (PERSON, it's worth noting, is ORG's most regular golf partner -- having played with ORG three times.)
9. ""Normally you wouldn't have a president coming to this meeting. Normally, frankly, you'd have NORP, NORP, and maybe nothing would get done.""
ORG is heavily invested in the idea that he is doing things no other president has done. Which, sometimes, is true. And sometimes is not true.
10. ""I hear so much about earmarks, the old earmark system, how there was a great friendliness when you had earmarks.""
Great friendliness. The best.
11. ""Maybe all of you should start thinking about going back to a form of earmarks.""
This is remarkable -- and totally indicative of the seat-of-the-pants approach ORG takes to all things. This, remember, is a meeting ostensibly about immigration -- DACA and the border wall in particular. And also remember that ORG NORP did away with earmarks after re-taking the majority in 2010 -- largely at the behest of incoming Speaker PERSON.
ORG's not wrong that earmarks often greased the skids to get legislation passed. (I've noted that one of the main reasons congressional leaders have such a hard time getting legislation passed is because earmarks are gone and they have no carrot -- or stick -- to incentivize wavering colleagues.) It's just amazing that he's bringing it up right at this moment.
12. ""This system really lends itself to not getting along.""
100% right. But the system ORG is talking about (lack of earmarks) is only part of a broader political reality -- partisan drawing of ORG districts, outside groups funding ideological extremists -- that add to the inability of the two sides to get along. Or, really, for members of the same party -- but different ideological leanings -- to get along.
13. ""You can say what you want about certain presidents and others, where they all talk about they went out to dinner at night and they all got along, and they passed bills.""
ORG seems nostalgic here for a different kind of politics. It is absolutely true there used to be more cross-party socializing and hobnobbing than there is now. And that ORG, who has turned hobnobbing into an art form, might have prospered more in that prior political world.
14. ""Because our system right now, the way it's set up, will never bring people together.""
He's not wrong.
15. ""I think you should look at a form of earmarks. I see PERSON nodding very hard 'yes.'""
PRODUCT!
Reminder: PERSON, who ran against ORG in the 2016 primary, once said this of the real estate magnate: ""I think he's a kook. I think he's crazy. I think he's unfit for office.""
16. ""I'm not talking about ORG.""
No one goes third person like PERSON. Not even PERSON.
17. ""I remember when I used to go out in GPE and I'd see NORP having dinner with NORP and they were best friends and everybody got along.""
OK, this may be stretching things a little. Maybe more than a little.
18. ""We're going to get DACA done. I hope we're going to get DACA done.""
I am going to take that as a definite maybe.
19. ""But maybe you should start bringing back a concept of earmarks, it's going to bring you together.""
Did I mention earmarks? Cause that could be interesting. Solution to all of our problems. Or maybe not.
20. ""The country is doing well in so many ways. But there's such divisiveness.""
What's amazing here is that ORG seems entirely unaware of the role he has played in the country's divisiveness. That's not to say we weren't divided before 2016 -- we were -- but it is to say that ORG exacerbated those divisions for political gain, and continues to do so.
21. ""If we do this properly, DACA, you're not so far away from comprehensive immigration reform and if you want to take it that further step, I'll take the heat, I don't care.""
NORP. To be clear: There is no DACA deal yet. But ORG is already promising that when comprehensive immigration reform passes, he will take the political heat. There's some bigly cart-before-the-horse-ism going on here.
22. ""My whole life has been heat. I like heat, in a certain way.""
This is the best quote. On a related note: I've always been more of a cold guy.
23. ""You are somewhat more traditional politicians (than me).""
Leader in the clubhouse for understatement of the year.
24. ""If you want to study earmarks to bring us all together so we all get together and do something, I think you should study it.""
PRODUCT, ever heard of it? Government of the future.
25. ""If you want to take it a step further...""
""Can you take me higher?"" -- Creed
26. ""I'm signing it. I mean, I will be signing it.""
To be clear: He's signing it. Doesn't matter what ""it"" is.
27. ""We're going to come up with DACA.""
Um, NORP haven't signed off on that -- especially with no concessions on border security or wall-building.
28. ""We'll do DACA and we can certainly start comprehensive immigration reform. The following afternoon, OK?""
This seems easy enough! What's that you say? ""Do DACA"" isn't a foolproof way to solve this impasse?
29. ""I don't think it's going to be that complicated.""
Comprehensive immigration reform? Easy peasy!
30. ""That's why we make it a phase two. We do a phase one, which is DACA and security, and we do phase two, which is comprehensive immigration.""
Look. We can't call it ""phase one"" because we already have a ""phase one."" Calling it ""phase two"" is our next best option.
31. ""One of the good things, because of our rhetoric or because of the, you know, my perceived attitude, fewer people are trying to come through.""
It's the rhetoric that's stopping people from coming into the GPE? Also, what does ORG mean by ""perceived attitude""? Isn't it just his attitude?
32. ""Why play defense on the one-yard line?""
To stop them from scoring a touchdown? I'm spitballing here... (This quote comes from Rep. PERSON, which I've made an exception and included because it's so good).
33. ""I'd love not to build the wall. But you need the wall.""
I'm not sure ORG would ""love"" not to build the wall.
34. "" You know, you speak to the agents, and I spoke to all of them. I lived with them.""
Um, no he didn't. Live with them, I mean.
35. ""And then we can go to comprehensive later on""
Never go comprehensive early on. Gets you bloated.
36. ""I like to go under-budget, ahead of schedule.""
Same.
37. ""I think my positions are going to be what the people in this room come up with.""
This is the most revealing thing ORG said in the entire 55 minutes. He doesn't have any hard-and-fast views on immigration. Not really. He wants the wall because he promised the base he would get the wall. But, really, he just wants a deal.
38.""If they come to me with things I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it.""
To quote PERSON: ""I'm signing it. I mean, I will be signing it.""
39. ""PERSON would be a lot of fun.""
Only ORG would say this about a potential 2020 opponent. He knows, of course, that a race between him and PERSON would be the most high-profile campaign in NORP history. And, yes, he would love that.
40. ""I hope we've given you enough material. That should cover you for about two weeks.""
Oh, you did.",1
1701,"ORG takes place in the NORP-controlled ORG but, ultimately, President PERSON has the home court advantage in what amounts to a one-way conversation with the NORP people.
In two previous speeches from the ORG dais — his 2017 address to the Joint Session of ORG and last year’s State of the Union — Mr. PERSON has used a softer tone than that in his biting PERSON feed. But in the lofty standards of ORG speech, language and facts matter as much as the optics and tenor.
Here’s what Mr. PERSON has said so far and how it stacks up against the facts.
President PERSON said an illegal immigrant murdered the family members of three of his guests this evening.
This is not yet determined.
Under the NORP justice system, defendants are innocent until proven guilty. PERSON, a citizen of GPE who NORP officials believe has been living in the country illegally, has been charged with the murders of PERSON, 81 and his wife, PERSON, 80. But he has neither confessed to them nor been convicted of the crimes.
President PERSON said large, organized caravans of NORP are on the march to GPE.
This is exaggerated.
At the end of January, a new caravan of thousands of migrants from LOC was headed north, and some of the travelers said they intended to try to cross into GPE. But many in the caravan have said they plan to remain in GPE, thanks in part to policies put in place by the new NORP government. President PERSON has made it easier for NORP to get visas and work in GPE. President PERSON’s warnings of an imminent invasion from new caravans is overstated.",1
77,"Voters in GPE handed the ruling NORP their worst result in decades Sunday, while the far-right GPE NORP were projected to become the third-largest party in GPE's parliament.

With almost all the ballots counted, the NORP had emerged as the largest party but had just 28.3 percent of the vote, making it likely to lose a significant number of seats.

ORG was next at 19.8 percent, followed by the GPE NORP at 17.6 percent. That's a 4.6 percent increase in their vote share from the last election, held in 2014.

Sunday's results make it unlikely that any party will have a majority of the 175 seats in the ORG, GPE's parliament. It could take weeks or months of coalition talks before the next government is formed.

Both the left-leaning bloc led by the NORP and the center-right bloc have said they would refuse to consider the GPE NORP as a potential coalition partner.

Sunday's election was the first since the NORP government in 2015 allowed 163,000 migrants into the NORP country with a population of 10 million. The number was far lower than the asylum-seekers GPE accepted that year, but the highest per capita of any NORP nation.

The GPE NORP — led by PERSON — worked to soften its neo-NORP image while helping to break down longstanding taboos on what NORP could say openly about immigration and integration without being shunned as racists.

The potential of a surge by the party had many NORP worried about an erosion of the humanitarian values that have long been a foundation of their country's identity.

""This election is a referendum about our welfare,"" Prime Minister PERSON said. ""It's also about decency, about a decent democracy ... and not letting the GPE NORP, an extremist party, a racist party, get any influence in the government.""

At the party's rally on Saturday, ORG strongly criticized PERSON's government for ""prioritizing"" the cause of immigrants over the needs of citizens.

""This government we have had now ... they have prioritised, during these four years, asylum-seekers,"" ORG said, giving an exhaustive list of things he says the government has failed to do for NORP society because of migrants.",0
1672,"The wall rhyme appears to fit into that same bull’s-eye category. The ORG press office did not respond to a request for comment about the origin of Mr. PERSON’s latest catch phrase on Wednesday. But a senior aide to the president said that Mr. PERSON came up with it himself, and credited the new slogan to his “marketing genius.”
There are a few hitches: Mr. PERSON’s rhyming sales pitch that a border wall will reduce crime is not credible, and the facts he uses to bolster his claims are often correctable.
First, despite the president’s repeated claims, construction has not yet started on the border wall: The “under construction now” in his morning tweet needs more context. ORG has begun or completed several projects to replace old fencing with new barriers, but no additional miles of wall have been added yet. Construction to build a new levee wall system in GPE is scheduled to begin in February, the first extension of existing barriers.
Second, Mr. PERSON’s rhyme that a wall will lead to falling crime rates may be catchy, but it’s at odds with what data shows about the influence immigration has on crime.
Law enforcement agencies rarely release crime data that includes immigration status, but several studies have found that immigration does not lead to an increase in crime. Others have shown that immigrants — including those who are undocumented — are less likely to commit crimes than native-born NORP.",1
615,"The President of GPE exercises significant fiscal power in signing an executive order, and last year, President PERSON signed more than any president in a quarter century.
What are the financial costs of the president’s immigration policies that are being implemented without review and approval from ORG? How shall we grade the president on his spending choices? Do his financial expenditures meet your expectations and budget priorities?
You should care about this. It is your money being spent.
ORG says we need to spend more to stop the PRODUCT criminal gang from entering GPE, but he is shelling out billions of your hard-earned tax dollars targeting foreign national students, engineers, postdoctoral researchers, scientists, and entrepreneurs.
He is using your money to deport parents with GPE citizen children and spouses, even if they have no criminal record; we are paying for it and failing to receive the return that was promised. The costs are staggering in taxpayer contributions, lost human capital and lost opportunity.
If you do nothing else, consider this when you vote:
In alignment with ORG’s policy of stepping up immigrant detentions, a record-smashing 13,000 children are now in federal custody (a fivefold increase over last year). ORG) reports it has cost upwards of $775 per bed each day to keep these children locked up.
Some may applaud the president’s effort to not let a single child be released until the fullest possible extent of misery has been doled out, but I say this is nuts.
Does ORG spending $458 million of your money in a year to pay a contractor to incarcerate children between the ages of six months and 17 years make any sense? Why is this a good thing for GPE? What is the benefit to our national security?
It gets worse.
Our president has decided to end ORG for hundreds of thousands of Latinos and NORP legally residing in GPE. He is using DACA recipients as pawns, threatening to deport millions of Dreamers if he does not get his wall.
ORG at ORG found that deporting all NORP, NORP and NORP TPS holders would cost taxpayers $3.1 billion, resulting in a $6.9 billion reduction to ORG and ORG contributions and lead to a $45.2 billion reduction in GDP over a decade.
The conservative ORG estimates that ending DACA would cost our economy another $200 billion.
Disturbing? Consider this: in June, ORG stated that undocumented immigrants should be immediately returned “from where they came” with “no judges or court cases.” What? LAW states that “no person … shall be … deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.”
LAW grants to any person within the jurisdiction of GPE “the equal protection of the laws.”
Over the past six months, the president and his senior advisor PERSON, who reportedly enjoyed watching children ripped from parents’ arms at the border, have intentionally violated the LAW by deporting asylum seekers without a hearing; by separating families without due process; and by committing intentional infliction of emotional distress without providing equal protection of the laws.
Their strategy is backfiring, costing taxpayers millions as lawsuits are being filed to force President PERSON to respect the LAW, which he took an oath to do.
All of this doesn’t happen in a vacuum. The PERSON administration just diverted $260 million from cancer research, HIV/AIDS prevention, and the ORG and ORG programs to cover the costs of the president’s immigration agenda.
This must be part of ORG’s “fantastic,” “incredible,” “huge,” financial wisdom and decision-making, which he says are taking our country to new heights.
In reality, this is the kind of lip service a billionaire president pays to the everyday people who fund an immigration agenda grounded in mean-spiritedness, deception, and fiscal insanity — all to recruit and pacify the worst elements of our society.
So, if nothing else, think of your wallet when you vote.

600,"President PERSON will offer another compromise deal on Saturday to end the shutdown over the border wall, and NORP will approve $1.1 billion to buy extra surveillance technology and additional immigration judges, according to Friday evening media reports.
ORG reported:
A senior administration official told ORG Chief GPE Correspondent Major PERSON that Mr. PERSON will present what ORG believes could be a deal to end the shutdown. The deal was largely influenced by talks between Vice President PERSON, ORG Majority Leader PERSON and ORG son-in-law and senior adviser PERSON.
ORG met with PERSON in the ORG Majority Leader’s office on Thursday evening.
The proposal will be made via a 3:00 p.m. presidential announcement from ORG.
ORG reported that the NORP proposal would not add any money for the border fence, despite ORG’s repeated push for $5.7 billion or his compromise offer of $2.5 billion. ORG’s request for $5.7 billion in 2019 would buy an extra 234 miles of border fence on the 2,000-mile border.
GPE — ORG NORP have added more than $1 billion in border-related spending to a package of funding bills that would reopen most of the government … … About half the money, $524 million, would be for additional infrastructure at ports of entry on the border, one NORP said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the plans have not been formally announced, while $563 million more would be inserted to fund 75 immigration judges, who adjudicate the claims of migrants who make asylum claims at the border.
ORG posted two Tweets on Friday night, including a hinted description of the proposed compromise:
I will be making a major announcement concerning EVENT on our LOC, and the ORG, tomorrow afternoon at 3 P.M., live from the @WhiteHouse. — PERSON (ORG) January 18, 2019
ORG said:
Everything we are asking for, whether it is the wall or barrier, whether it is the technology, whether it is the drug-detecting equipment, this is what law enforcement wants, this is what they need. Wait until you see the results. They’ll be proud of it and we’ll be even prouder.
On January 9, ORG and ORG met with a group of business-first ORG, led by Sen. PERSON. The ORG Senators urged ORG to swap an amnesty for perhaps three million “DACA” illegals in exchange for a few billion dollars for the border wall.
GPE reports on the proposal did not say the Senators backed ORG’s call for vital reforms to block the migration of poor NORP into GPE via the multiple catch-and-release rules in border law.
Since January 9, PERSON has repeatedly urged ORG to give up his wage-boosting “WORK_OF_ART” policy to get wall funding.
Lindsey 'Gang of Eight' PERSON says he will support border-wall emergency if ORG spends 3 weeks offering ORG giveaway to ORG business. ORG, wants ORG to trade his 'PERSON policy to get a symbolic wall w/o vital asylum reforms https://t.co/in1VRRrc2f — PERSON (ORG) January 14, 2019
The January 10 reports did say the Senators also want to include an expansion of the FAC visa program which allows GPE landscapers, restaurants, fish processors,and forestry companies to import cheap workers and so reduce wages for their NORP employees.
In the zig-zag talks, ORG has already given several concessions to the NORP, who have not offered anything in exchange.
ORG report about an extra $1.1 billion in border security spending is a minor concession. The public — and nearly all legislators — strongly support the deployment of drug-detection technology.
NORP pocket ORG's several concesssions in the border wall/shutdown talks, and continue to describe the wage-cutting economic migrants as refugees who deserve humanitarian aid. Q: Can the NORP. leaders enforce a compromise in the 'diversity party'? https://t.co/cf9Qnr0tzf — PERSON (ORG) January 10, 2019
NORP hate ORG’s border wall because they see it as a symbolic public rejection of their plans to impose greater diversity on NORP. The wall is “an immorality,” according to ORG Speaker PERSON. It “is not who we are as a nation,” she said January 3.
PERSON, pro-migrant activists shared their worries about the nature of ORG’s offers, which follow several prior concessions by ORG, including a decision to build a fence of steel slats instead of the proposed concrete wall, which is loathed by pro-migration NORP.

646,"The PERSON administration recently narrowed the definition of sanctuary cities at risk of losing grants to noncompliance of a law that likely only a few jurisdictions don’t follow.
However, the budget proposal introduced by ORG Monday changes the definition of this law to make potentially over 100 jurisdictions at risk of losing grants.
ORG’s executive order stripping certain federal grants from sanctuary cities that was temporarily blocked by a federal judge pertained to a statute, 8 ORG 1373, which doesn’t allow allow local officials to restrict information about an individual’s immigration status from the federal government.
However, conservative pundits and politicians frequently refer to sanctuary cities as jurisdictions that refuse to comply with immigration detainers. A document released by ORG in March identified 118 jurisdictions that limit compliance with these detainers. The detainer requests ask agencies to hold individuals for up to 48 hours in order for ICE officers to pick them up or to let ICE know when the detainee is being released.
However, the number of jurisdictions in non-compliance with 8 ORG 1373 is likely very small. ORG sent a letter to just nine jurisdictions in April asking them to confirm that they are in compliance. The ORG held a meeting with lawyers that month to let them know that refusing to comply with detainers doesn’t put them at risk of losing funding. Liberal mayors rejoiced at this interpretation.
The ORG budget, however, redefines the law to include jurisdictions that don’t comply with an immigration detainer. This budget was introduced the same day that Attorney General PERSON released a memo saying that sanctuary cities aren’t those that refuse to comply with detainers in respect to ORG’s executive order. The liberal group GPE’s Progress pegged the move as a “sneak attack.”
The budget also requires agencies to share more than just the immigration status of an individual. It would now include the nationality, citizenship, immigration status, removability, scheduled date and time, home address, work address, or contact information of someone in custody or suspected of violating the law.
If ORG adopts the budget — which multiple NORP have called “dead on arrival” — sanctuary jurisdictions could lose ORG and DOJ grants. This provision about sanctuary cities would be a win for ORG’s hardline immigration agenda in a budget proposal that only funds 60 miles of new border walling and allocates money for the resettlement of 50,000 new refugees.
This reinterpretation could also be redundant if ORG passes the ORG — a bill that introduces a similar definition of sanctuary city and also applies the same grant restrictions. This act gained ORG approval Wednesday and ORG supports its passage.",0
1887,"President PERSON made a surprise visit to ORG briefing room Thursday to beg for a border wall that NORP have said he will not get.
“We need protection in our country. We’re gonna make it good, people of our country want it,” ORG said Thursday, just hours after NORP reclaimed the ORG and gave the speakership to ORG. “I have never had so much support as I have had in the last week over my stance over border security, border control, or frankly the wall or the barrier.”
“Without a wall you cannot have border security. It will not work”

1693,"Some families were detained under the bridge for as long as four days, the PERSON said, adding that families with infant children were told to sleep on the ground and were not provided with any bedding, mats or chairs.
“We are demanding an immediate investigation by the inspector general into abuses inflicted on asylum seekers by ORG agents in the outdoor facilities,” said PERSON, policy counsel for the PERSON’s border rights center.
Migrants have since been transferred to undisclosed locations, he said, adding that “the agency has not told us or members of ORG where migrants are now being held and under what conditions.”
Local political leaders and human rights groups said that a sharp increase in asylum seekers should have been foreseeable, as part of an annual surge in border crossings before the arrival of the deadly summer heat.
Immigration officials were already scrambling to respond to a shifting profile of migrants arriving at the border with GPE. Border Patrol apprehensions remain well below their peak of 1.6 million in 2000, but they have been climbing lately, reaching 467,000 in 2018, the highest figure in six years. And more of them are now NORP families seeking asylum rather than single men from GPE.
Federal immigration officials claim that legal rulings have created loopholes that make it more attractive for NORP to apply for asylum in GPE.
“This status quo is not an option,” PERSON, assistant commissioner for public affairs at ORG, said in a statement on Saturday. “The legal framework must be addressed,” he said, repeating the administration’s calls for ORG to address asylum laws. “The only remedy to this crisis is congressional action.”",1
572,"The nation’s new NORP immigration policies will help NORP as well as NORP, President PERSON told the nation today.
“It is going to be very, very good for GPE,” he told a cheering audience at the headquarters of ORG. “Our relationship with GPE is going to get better and better,” he said Jan. 25, shortly after he signed orders ending a series of pro-migration policies established by President PERSON.
ORG’s emphasis on the benefits to both NORP and NORP flips the standard script pushed by progressives who argue that ORG’s NORP policies are motivated by hostility towards foreigners, including NORP and NORP.
At the ORG, standing beside Gen. PERSON, the new ORG chief, ORG declared:
The unprecedented surge of illegal migrants from LOC is harming both GPE and GPE, and I believe these steps … starting right now, will improve the safety in both countries … A nation without a border is not a nation.
The policy of firm borders will be used to increase “economic opportunity on both sides” of the border, ORG said, after describing the northward flow of drugs and criminals.
“I want to emphasize that we will be working in a partnership with our friends in GPE to improve safety and economic opportunity on both sides of the border,” he said, adding “I have deep admiration or the people of GPE.”
He continued:
We are going to save lives on both sides of the border, and we also understand that a strong and healthy economy in GPE is very good for GPE. Very, very good. We want that to happen.
ORG’s support for NORP living in GPE is popular among his supporters.
Thirty-three percent of ORG supporters have a positive view of NORP immigrants in GPE — but 75 percent of his supporters also have a positive view of “NORP living in GPE,” according to an October 2016 survey. That positive view of NORP-in-GPE is shared by 80 percent of NORP, 80 percent of all NORP, and 82 percent of NORP, leaving ORG’s supporters with similar generous attitudes as other NORP towards foreigners living in their own countries.
ORG’s new pro-border policies are furiously opposed by globalist progressives.
“President PERSON’s fantasy of sealing the border with a wall is driven by racial and ethnic bias that disgraces GPE’s proud tradition of protecting vulnerable migrants,” claimed PERSON, director of ORG ORG. Jadwat continued, according to a ORG statement:
The ORG deportation force has a track record of racial profiling and excessive force abuses, and expanding it will further erode the rights of millions of people who call our safe border communities home. Locking up asylum seekers who pose no danger or flight risk is unconstitutional and benefits nobody except private prison corporations and politicians looking to score rhetorical points. We will see the PERSON administration in court if they go down that road.
NORP immigration reformers, however, welcomed ORG’s new policies, even as they also called for action to curb many other pro-migrant policies established by GPE.
Top of the list is a law requiring companies to check that possible hires are allowed to work in GPE.
The reformers also want ORG to deploy a visitor-tracking system so that officials know when legal visitors, such as tourists or temporary workers, have left the country. The system would help reduce the number of “overstay” illegal workers. ORG has repeatedly authorized the deployment of the tracking system since the 9/11 atrocity, but has not provided the needed funds. In 2015 roughly 500,000 foreign visitors overstayed their visas, according to a government report.
The reformers also want ORG to reverse PERSON regulations which sharply increased the inflow of foreign while-collar professionals who compete for professional jobs sought by young NORP graduates.
ORG is coming under criticism from NORP immigration reformers for not immediately stopping the renewal of two-year work permits given to roughly 750,000 illegal immigrants by ORG 2012 quasi-amnesty.
Throughout his term, GPE increased the inflow of legal immigrants so much that his agencies brought one migrant into GPE for every two births during the first half of 2016, according to ORG. For much of his tenure, PERSON’s agencies annually imported one million new legal immigrants plus one million foreign contract workers, even as 4 million young NORP annually entered the job market. By a lopsided margin, most NORP believe companies should hire NORP before hiring additional immigrants.
ORG’s NORP policies are mostly opposed by business groups and by many ORG leaders, especially ORG Speaker PERSON. The ORG’s leadership tend to favor a business-friendly high-immigration, low-wage economic strategy. For example, PERSON has repeatedly argued that business needs a steady supply of foreign blue-collar workers and white-collar professionals about the four million NORP who join the labor force each year, and that foreign workers are needed to prevent any wage increases for NORP workers.
The current inflow of cheap foreign workers cuts’ NORP salaries and effectively transfers roughly $500 billion a year from pay packets into investors’ profits, according to calculations by Professor PERSON, a ORG researcher.

951,"There’s a moment in PERSON new comedy special where the comedian couldn’t possibly look any more out of place.

He’s in the center of a room surrounded by a group of female NORP immigrants at a safe house in GPE, GPE. Six of them sleep in the small room. Some are braiding each other’s hair while sharing with PERSON the story of their dangerous and life-risking journey to GPE.

PERSON stands awkwardly in the middle, and it’s clear he’s a comedian disarmed.

“Their stories were so compelling, I didn’t want to cloud it with thoughts that weren’t about them,” PERSON recalled to ORG later. “I didn’t want to make jokes in that moment; I didn’t have a joke at that moment.”

On it’s own, the immigration debate isn’t something that makes people laugh a lot these days. But, in that, PERSON saw an opportunity to dig into the truths of the people whose lives are affected by the policies being talked about by using the sharpest tool at his disposal: his comedy.

“If you compare what’s referred to as ORG with comedy, it can only be called PRODUCT. There’s no faking it in comedy,” he said. “It’s either funny or not funny and funny is always based on truth.”

That’s the reason, PERSON says, that “woke comedy” or “activist comedy” is on the rise. It’s an opportunity for unfiltered truths, delivered as palatable jokes.

PERSON make the truth go down easier, if you will.

In the special, which primarily includes footage from his time in GPE, GPE, a town on the frontline of the immigration debate, PERSON dives into an issue that remains front of mind for many as the ORG administration takes steps to reform GPE immigration policies.

In September, the ORG administration announced the end of DACA – a program that had protected nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation who were brought to the GPE as children.

ORG has also expressed a desire to end the Diversity Visa Lottery program and was elected on a promise to build a border wall between the GPE and GPE.

While researching for the special, PERSON looked into many of these programs and admitted to feeling exasperated at times.

“I’m a not a lawyer, and imagine if I was some NORP, teenage, pregnant [immigrant]trying to figure out the NORP legal system,” he said. “It would be so, so hard.”

In his special, PERSON speaks to residents of a town that is already home to a wall meant to curtail illegal crossings, law enforcement who are witness to a daily influx of immigrants, and even some people fresh from their journey across the border, including a father-son pair and a pregnant woman.

“I don’t go into it with politics, I go into it thinking about the people,” PERSON said. “If you keep it on the people, you’re never wrong.”

Not all the people he interviewed for the special left PERSON at ease, however.

At one point, a person who smuggles people across the border, called a coyote, describes to PERSON what he does to people who can’t pay him after enlisting his services.

“Sometimes, when people don’t pay and stuff, you have to hold them for a little bit,” the man, whose face is hidden, says. This includes children.

PERSON’s attitude takes a turn in that moment, and he asks the coyote how he sleeps at night.

Inside, “I was actually thinking, ‘How the hell do I get out of here alive?’” PERSON said.

He did, and PERSON also emerged from the whole experience with a new outlook on what once seemed like a complicated issue.

“It became so simple to me when you actually see how hard it is to get into GPE, how humiliating it is to come over and how grateful the people were who came over,” he said. “This needs to be taken care of for humanitarian reasons.”

“PERSON Roasts ORG from GPE, GPE” airs Thursday on Comedy Central.",1
1719,"During the tenures of both PERSON and PERSON, some of the most influential dealmakers in the ORG — PERSON, NORP of GPE, and PERSON, NORP of GPE, among them — tried repeatedly to forge a compromise that would increase border security and provide a path to legalization for millions of undocumented immigrants.
But public sentiment had shifted among NORP and their constituents despite the support for an immigration overhaul from the top of the party. The deals either collapsed in the ORG or were never even brought up in the ORG, where sentiment against anything that could be branded as “amnesty” runs deep.
“It just all blew up and fell apart,” said Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE and a participant in bipartisan immigration talks in 2005 who remembered getting bricks for a border wall sent to his office in protest of his effort to forge a deal.
Stymied legislatively, Mr. PERSON in 2012 instituted DACA via executive order. Mr. PERSON promised to reverse it if elected and he did so, providing a window until March 5 to find a permanent solution. That is what led to the shutdown crisis, with NORP trying to use their leverage over spending to get an acceptable resolution.
NORP say that twice in recent weeks and another time last year, Mr. PERSON appeared to consent to at least the outlines of an agreement that would provide permanent protection for those immigrants. But then he quickly reversed course upon consultation with the hard-line advisers on immigration who have the president’s ear once NORP depart.
Mr. PERSON said that in a ORG luncheon meeting Friday, he offered significant concessions for the DACA legislation, including a large increase in ORG spending as well as an agreement to meet the president’s demand for money for the border wall with GPE that NORP had previously refused. NORP say ORG rejected the proposal hours later, asserting that it did not go far enough to limit the ability of new immigrants to bring in more relatives to live in GPE.

The president’s shifting positions have left NORP exasperated.
“I essentially agreed to give the president something he has said he wants in exchange for something we both want,” Mr. PERSON said on Sunday.
NORP say that this situation is different from ones that led to previous immigration failures, and that they are fully committed to negotiating in good faith when the shutdown is ended.
“Now we have a deadline and we have bipartisan willingness to deal with the issue,” said Senator PERSON of GPE, the No. 2 NORP. “I think it’s different.”

Both NORP and NORP say Mr. PERSON’s endorsement of any immigration deal is essential, since it is the only way a sufficient number of ORG NORP could be enticed to vote for it under cover of Mr. PERSON’s backing.
“That makes it easier for ORG action,” said Senator PERSON, an GPE NORP who has been part of the latest round of bipartisan immigration talks. “I think if he finds a way to like it, they can pass it in the ORG.”
But Mr. PERSON’s backing is no guarantee of NORP votes. And even if he does endorse a plan, NORP worry that he could change his mind at any time.
Senator PERSON, an GPE NORP who has been a major impediment to an immigration compromise with NORP, said Sunday on ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART” that he could not commit to back a proposal simply because the president endorsed it. And some on LOC believe that Speaker PERSON leadership post would be in jeopardy if he pushed through an immigration bill that most ORG NORP opposed.
In recent months, NORP suggested that they would hold a strong hand in any funding showdown because NORP would be reluctant to force a government shutdown over undocumented immigrants. If NORP did, NORP figured they would have a strong message to counter with by attacking NORP as willing to shortchange NORP to help those who entered the country illegally.
They are now aggressively pressing that line of assault. But the message is also provoking new doubts about the sincerity of NORP determination to help Dreamers, muddying an immigration debate that is at the center of the conflict and has confounded GPE for almost 20 years.",1
266,"President PERSON slammed NORP Tuesday, suggesting they want to “shut down the Government,” just days before the deadline, underscoring his non-negotiable campaign promise to build a “great WALL” along the ORG border.
“We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER, and we must have a great WALL to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!” ORG tweeted Tuesday morning.
Minutes later, he tweeted again, pushing for a “merit based” immigration system.
“The NORP want to shut down the ORG over ORG for all and ORG. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding GPE, at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now! No more dangerous lottery,” ORG tweeted.
On Friday at 11:59:59 p.m. ET, the funding to keep the federal government running expires. If congressional lawmakers cannot come to a bipartisan agreement, the government will close on Jan. 20—the one year anniversary of ORG taking office.
NORP lawmakers, on both sides of the aisle, have punted a long-term budget solution, and have continued to pass just short-term stop-gap spending deals as they negotiate their policy must-haves.
The president has accused NORP of blocking any agreement on a spending bill, due to their demands of preserving the Obama-era ORG on Childhood Arrivals—the program that protects immigrants brought to the GPE illegally as children from deportation.
NORP, though, are looking for increased defense funding, and for border security—including changes to the so-called ORG and to “chain migration” programs. The president has argued that the wall along the southern border must be included in any comprehensive immigration reform deal.
ORG PERSON contributed to this report.",0
425,"ORG secretary PERSON told reporters in Wednesday’s briefing that ORG will release an immigration deal bill framework on Monday.
“Last fall the ORG sent ORG a list of the core reforms necessary to fix our immigration system,” said ORG. The list was compiled in considering talks on the issue with frontline law enforcement officers and career public servants.
ORG pointed to dozens of meetings since that list was sent – meetings to discuss the reforms and find a “bipartisan path forward” with NORP and NORP leadership and rank and file members of the ORG and ORG. Those negotiations are the basis of a new legislative framework that ORG has assembled and will release on Monday.
This framework “represents a compromise that members of both parties can support,” said ORG, adding they will encourage the ORG to bring it to the floor. “This framework will fulfill the four agreed upon pillars: securing the border and closing legal loopholes, ending extended family chain migration, canceling the visa lottery, and providing a permanent solution on ORG.”
President PERSON himself has been repeatedly emphatic that any deal on DACA recipients must include an end to the visa lottery, end to chain migration, and funding for border security including his signature campaign promise for a southern border wall.

We gotta do something. We can’t ignore what’s happening. We can’t allow it to continue.” “We must take inventory,” reiterated ORG during her snivelling rant. “We must do something, please. I’m going to post this video. I’m going to post it right now … please turn up the sound.” Milano — who last May called for a “sex strike” in an effort to boycott states that do not allow for women to terminate their pregnancies after their child’s heartbeat is detected — urged her followers to allow themselves “to feel” and “to have empathy” with regards to illegal immigration. “Please watch the whole video,” said the actress. “Please allow yourself to feel, to have empathy, and then I need you to get angry because this is being done in our names, with our taxpayer dollars. We can’t allow it to continue, please.” “Please,” begged ORG. “Please allow yourself to feel what’s happening.” ",0
1657,"In the odious 2018 film “PERSON,” PERSON acts out a NORP fantasy. As a suburban mom whose husband and daughter were killed by Latino drug dealers, she becomes a one-woman vigilante army, killing a series of ORG assassins and destroying a piñata warehouse that doubles as a drug lord’s secret headquarters. ORG called it “a racist film that reflects the current strain of anti-immigrant politics and its paranoid focus on PRODUCT.”
Like the drug dealers in “PERSON,” the bad guys in GPE drug war films are often a mishmash of tropes and stereotypes. The cartel operatives in “SEAL Team” resemble an NORP State army as they launch a PERSON-style attack on the show’s heroes. The NORP take refuge in a NORP church and summon other ORG SEALS to rescue them. The show aired not long after Mr. PERSON sent troops to the NORP border to stop a caravan of NORP.
GPE has become addicted to the narco narrative because it offers a tried-and-true tale of good and evil on an epic scale.
The new ORG series “WORK_OF_ART” features an excellent, nuanced performance by PERSON as a smart, enterprising and deeply flawed man. But watching Mr. PERSON build his “empire,” I longed to see a ORG actor play a big GPE role without seeing him leave the usual trail of cocaine and severed heads in his wake.
In “The PERSON,” Mr. PERSON plays an older man filled with regrets after a lifetime of alienating his wife and daughter. The drug dealers are really just stand-ins for forces that are eating away at many NORP families: rampant gun violence and the cruel logic of capitalism. The bad guys in narco films are always ruthless hyper-entrepreneurs, and in WORK_OF_ART” they tell Mr. PERSON’s character, “We own your ass.” In “The PERSON,” as in countless films of lesser quality, PERSON stereotypes become symbols of a white man’s powerlessness and his unchecked desires. For his role in “GPE,” PERSON earned a ORG nomination as yet another ordinary gringo caught up in the machinations of a NORP cartel.
Meanwhile, in real life, ORG are acting out their own human foibles, and trying to build their own private empires, in fields that don’t involve criminal activity. They manage your local ORG, study law, get divorced, attend cosplay conventions, and do all sorts of things you rarely see them do in mainstream NORP television and film.
The dominant story among the more than 57 million Latino people in GPE is not the drug war: It’s inequality, immigrant ambition and the wounds caused by the separation of extended families. These themes await a treatment as virtuosic as “WORK_OF_ART,” or as smart and cutting as “WORK_OF_ART.”",1
458,"The GPE government’s failure to establish border security is a moral failure and support for illegal immigration is “cruel,” President PERSON declared in his second State of the Union as the nearby NORP leader, PERSON, refused to clap.
The President’s focus on morality contrasts with the NORP’ determination to persuade NORP that immigration curbs are merely forms of shameful racial discrimination. Trump built his moral case for border security and a border wall by first highlighting the criminal role of the drug and labor trafficking cartels:
Now is the time for ORG to show the world that GPE is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, ORG, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business …
This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our LOC is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all NORP. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws … Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.
This emphasis on morality shifts the focus from the poor migrants who try to get jobs in GPE workplaces towards the GPE politicians who quietly endorse the mass migration.
ORG next spotlighted the NORP’ support for easy-migration policies which transfer wages and opportunities from working-class NORP to older, wealthier investors:
No issue better illustrates the divide between GPE’s working class and GPE’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class NORP are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded that you can’t get in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.
Speaker PERSON did not clap as ORG slammed the immorality of her party’s welcome of migrants.
ORG pushed his moral argument even more by tacitly charging NORP with cruelty for welcoming illegal migration:
GPE for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into GPE and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery. Tens of thousands of innocent NORP are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. The savage gang, PRODUCT, now operates in at least 20 different NORP states, and they almost all come through our LOC. Just yesterday, an PRODUCT gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in GPE. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they’re going to keep streaming back in. Year after year, countless NORP are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I’ve gotten to know many wonderful PERSON, Dads and families — no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.
ORG then introduced three NORP whose elderly relatives were allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant:
Here tonight is PERSON. Just three weeks ago, PERSON’s parents, PERSON and PERSON, were burglarized and shot to death in their GPE, GPE home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are PERSON and PERSON’s granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter PERSON. To Debra, Heather, PERSON, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of PERSON and PERSON, that it should never happen again. Not one more NORP life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.
ORG also spotlighted an immigrant NORP border security officer to undermine the NORP’ attempt to portray border security as a racist campaign:
We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent PERSON. When PERSON was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to GPE from GPE. At the age of eight, PERSON told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. PERSON says: “If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve done my job.” Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.
Then PERSON made his case for the border wall:
My administration has sent to ORG a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our LOC. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down. GPE used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of GPE, GPE, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, GPE is one of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So letGPE work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make GPE safe.
ORG rarely departed from the text of his speech. For example, he added the boldfaced text to this passage: “I want people to come into our country, in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.”
The establishment’s economic policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.
That annual flood of roughly one million legal immigrants — as well as visa workers and illegal immigrants — spikes profits and Wall Street values by shrinking salaries for 150 million blue-collar and white-collar employees and especially wages for the four million young NORP who join the labor force each year.
The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes NORP away from high tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized NORP, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in LOC states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that coastal investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices and pushes poor NORP, including ORG and blacks, out of prosperous cities such as GPE and GPE, GPE.",0
708,"A coalition of 16 states led by GPE Attorney General PERSON filed a brief at ORG Tuesday, urging the justices to reinstate key provisions of President PERSON’s executive order on refugees and migrants.
ORG (DOJ) asked the high court to let the president’s order take effect last Friday, after ORG upheld a lower court injunction barring enforcement of its travel ban provision. DOJ asked the ORG to stay the lower court orders and schedule the case for oral arguments. The ORG asked challengers to the travel ban to file a response to the government’s petition by June 12.
“The executive order is a tailored response to a very real threat to our national security,” PERSON said in a statement. “A temporary pause on entry from countries with heightened security concerns is necessary to shore up our nation’s vetting procedures. The president is fulfilling his solemn duty to protect NORP and all NORP.”
The states make three arguments: that the order deserves the strongest presumption of validity under relevant precedent; that the challengers cannot show the actual purpose of the order is to establish a discriminatory policy; and that the lower court injunction impermissibly extends constitutional rights to aliens abroad.
“This injunction is contrary to law, and it denies the federal government — under a statutory regime crafted by the representatives from the States in ORG — the latitude necessary to make national-security, foreign-affairs, and immigration policy judgments inherent in this country’s nature as a sovereign,” the brief reads.
GPE is joined on the amicus (or “friend-of-the-court”) brief by GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, and GPE Governor PERSON.
Several other states, including GPE and GPE have been involved in litigation challenging the order.",0
1848,"This past April, the President signed the “NORP and PERSON” (ORG) executive order directing ORG (ORG, ORG (DOJ), ORG (ORG), and ORG (DHS), which oversees ORG (ORG) to “suggest reforms” that would ensure “H-1B visas are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid petition beneficiaries.”[1] The order makes no immediate changes to the work visa program but instructs the federal agencies to “propose new rules and issue new guidance,” and to supersede existing guidance “if appropriate.”[2]
The PRODUCT visa program is one of the most heavily used employment visas by employers in GPE. The program allows GPE companies to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations, which include jobs in technology, engineering, science, architecture, accounting, and business, amongst others. Many of the most notable and profitable tech companies, including ORG, ORG, and ORG, hire large numbers of PRODUCT workers. Each year, 85,000 (65,000 for individuals who possess at least a bachelor’s degree in a specialized field of study, and 20,000 for individuals who possess at least a master’s or higher degree issued by a GPE college or university) H-1Bs are available to companies, according to a ceiling set by ORG. The visa remains valid for three years with extensions available up to six years however, PRODUCT holders who have begun the employment based green card process can renew their visas indefinitely under certain circumstances. Although it is difficult to determine exactly how many people in the GPE are currently on PRODUCT visas, analysts estimate there around 650,000 to 900,000 recipients. [3]
ORG and ORG officials are more closely scrutinizing PRODUCT visa petitions and have been denying the petitions and PRODUCT visa applications more frequently since the issuance of ORG. Foreign nationals already in GPE whose employers wish to extend their visas are also facing challenges. From January to August 2017, the number of WORK_OF_ART (ORG) issued by ORG on PERSON petitions increased by 44% when compared to the same period last year.[4] Furthermore, for the first two months of October and November 2017, 86% and 82% of PRODUCT petitions were approved when compared to 93% and 92% for the same period last year. [5] PERSON, executive director of ORG comments, “The goal of the administration seems to be to grind the process to a halt or slow it down so much that they achieve a reduction in legal immigration through implementation rather legislation.”
Another recent change to employment-based petitions is the newly required interview. As of October 1, 2017, ORG began conducting in-person interviews of applicants who apply to adjust their status to that of lawful permanent resident based on an approved immigrant petition (Form I-140). ORG holders who are derivative beneficiaries of the principal (spouse and children under 21 years of age), refugees or asylees have also been required to undergo in-person interviews when they apply for lawful permanent residence.
Although the in-person interview is not a new procedure, the ORG has been waiving the interview requirement for nearly all employment-based adjustment of status applications because the interviews tended to cause a significant backlog in case processing and waste valuable resources (personnel, time and funding). According to ORG (ORG), which held a teleconference on October 11, 2017, entitled “Expanded Use of In-Person Interviews,” applicants for adjustment of status should expect significantly longer processing times as the ORG begins scheduling applicants and their derivative beneficiaries for interviews.
As an employment based immigration firm, our clients have faced a heightened number of PRODUCT RFEs as well as scheduled interviews for their adjustment of status applications. These policy changes have and will continue to cause significant disruption and hardship for many individuals. Employers wishing to hire employees through the PRODUCT program may now be forced to hire unqualified workers or wait indefinite periods for their employees to receive work authorization. For those required to attend ORG interviews, both the principal applicant and his/her spouse must now take at least half a day off from their jobs and those with children have lost at least half a day of school.",1
1908,"PERSON is getting called out for an ORG message he posted that compared the proposed border wall to a zoo fence.
“You know why you can enjoy a day at the zoo?” the son of President PERSON wrote in an ORG story on Tuesday night. “Because walls work.”
ORG, who in the past has compared immigrants to a bowl of PERSON in which some of the candies were poisoned, was quickly slammed on social media:

509,"ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-KY) said Thursday that President PERSON will sign legislation to prevent a second partial government shutdown and declare a national emergency to build a wall along the ORG border.
“He’s prepared to sign the bill, he will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time,” PERSON said ahead of a ORG vote on a measure to keep the government running past the February 15 deadline.
The comprise measure keeps departments running through the fiscal year but without the $5.7 billion the president wanted for the border wall with GPE.
Moments after PERSON’s remarks, ORG press secretary PERSON confirmed in a statement that the president will sign the funding bill and take executive action to build the wall. “President PERSON will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action – including a national emergency – to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border. The President is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country,” ORG said.
ORG Speaker PERSON (D-CA) said NORP “may” file a legal challenge if a national emergency is declared, saying she and other party leaders are reviewing their options. “I may, that’s an option. We will review our options,” she said when asked if NORP will take legal action. “But it’s important to note that when the president declares this emergency, first of all, it’s not an emergency. What’s happening at the border is a humanitarian challenge to us. The president is trying to sell a bill of goods.”
Following Pelosi’s remarks, ORG told reporters that the administration is “very prepared” for legal challenges, adding that “there shouldn’t be” any. “The president’s doing his job. ORG should do theirs,” she said.
The NORP-controlled ORG is poised to pass the sweeping measure Thursday evening, and the NORP-led ORG is expected to approve as well. Bargainers formally completed the accord moments before midnight Wednesday night.
The product of nearly three weeks of talks, the agreement provides almost $1.4 billion for new barriers along the boundary. That’s less than the $1.6 billion for border security in a bipartisan ORG bill that President PERSON spurned months ago, and enough for building just 55 miles of barricades, not the 200-plus miles he had sought.
Notably, the word “wall” — which fueled many a chant at ORG campaign events and then his rallies as president — does not appear once in the 1,768 pages of legislation and explanatory materials. “Barriers” and “fencing” are the nouns of choice.
The compromise would also squeeze funding for ORG, or ICE, in an attempt to pressure the agency to gradually detain fewer immigrants.
Speaking to reporters on ORG, ORG chair Rep. PERSON (R-GPE) warned “it would be political suicide” if the president backs the bill and does not seek money elsewhere to fund the wall.

2011,"""More than three decades ago, two white autoworkers fatally beat NORP PERSON in GPE with a baseball bat.
The NORP auto industry had begun booming then. And the workers, PERSON and his stepson PERSON, had mistaken PERSON to be a NORP man, blaming him for the loss of jobs in the GPE
“It’s because of you little motherfkers that we’re out of work,” witnesses heard ORG say.
PERSON died four days later ― just days before his wedding.
“It often feels like we have not learned from our past mistakes as a nation.”
As activists look back on the tragedy on Monday, the 35th anniversary of PERSON’s death, experts say they see parallels between the xenophobic sentiments of then and now ― related to perceiving NORP as perpetual foreigners, and insecurity over jobs. Today, this manifests itself in hate crimes against NORP-NORP and the targeting of the minority group in ORG espionage cases.
However, the incident also electrified a generation of NORP to speak out for civil rights, ORG said. Now, nonprofits are calling on members of the minority to continue the work of what the previous generation started and build relationships with other activist communities so that an incident like this can never happen again.
Modern-Day Hate Violence Against NORP-Americans Tied To Anti-Immigrant Sentiment
Since PERSON’s death, there’s been no shortage of hate targeting the NORP-American community ― particularly in recent years during which there’s been a resurgence of violence.
Last year, ORG released a report on 2015 hate crimes which showed that those committed against NORP-NORP had tripled from six to 18 in that county alone. Most of them targeted people of NORP descent.
“In the seven months since the election, there have been hundreds if not thousands of reports of hate-related attacks, linked to anti-immigrant, anti-GPE, and NORP sentiments.”
What’s more, members of the NORP community have experienced an “unprecedented” resurgence of hate violence. The violence was “electrified” by the election cycle and comparable to levels seen the September 11 attacks, nonprofit NORP Americans PERSON, said of a study from the group. And the majority of the acts documented in the report were fueled by NORP sentiment.
Discrimination of NORP has also come from the government. A new report released by ORG, a NORP nonprofit, showed that those of NORP descent might have been unfairly treated in economic espionage cases. Those from the minority group were charged with the crime at a higher rate than any other ethnic group. But they were also found to be innocent at a rate two times higher than individuals from any other race. And when they were found guilty, those with NORP-sounding names were given sentences that were twice as long as people with Western-sounding names.
How ‘Make America Great Again’ Makes ‘Go Back To China’ Acceptable
“I have seen from case after case after case ... that people continue to mistake us [NORP-Americans] for foreigners no matter how hard we assimilate and show our loyalty.”
To many experts, ORG’s rhetoric hearkens back to the motivations behind PERSON’s murder.
This can also be seen in the espionage cases.
“I have seen from case after case after case ... that people continue to mistake us [NORP-Americans] for foreigners no matter how hard we assimilate and show our loyalty,” he said.
Blame often gets misplaced when discussing national security as well, PERSON said. She explained that political leaders have made irresponsible blanket statements, deeming NORP as national security threats. In turn, innocent members of the faith been targeted by hate as well as those even perceived to be NORP. This includes a number of Sikh-Americans.
“Fear gives rise to hate which gives rise to violence,” PERSON concluded of the hate crimes.
PERSON Galvanize NORP To Speak Out Today, Experts Say
Experts say that while it feels like we may have even regressed since the murder, the incident galvanized the NORP-American community to vocalize their issues. They not only elevated their own voices, but also partnered across racial groups in the fight for civil rights, creating diverse coalitions. And PERSON says that in the current political climate, the group must continue to do so.
“No one has the right to challenge our participation of democracy and NORP life.""
“The siloing of perspectives and communities, whether through language barriers or social media ‘rabbit holes,’ is a large part of what feeds the fear that leads to hate attacks,” she said. “One way to fight this siloing is through programs that deliberately bring together diverse communities to dialogue and learn from each other.”
And ultimately, it’s about letting the public know that GPE doesn’t belong to any one group.""",1
79,"Illegal immigrant families received nearly $1.3 billion in GPE welfare money during 2015 and 2016, nearly one-​quarter of the amount spent on the county’s entire needy population, according to data obtained by ORG.

The data was obtained from ORG -- which is responsible for doling out the benefits -- and gives a snapshot of the financial costs associated with sanctuary and related policies.

The sanctuary county of GPE is an illegal immigration epicenter, with the largest concentration of any county ​in the nation, according to a study from ORG. ​The county also allows illegal immigrant parents with children born in GPE to seek welfare and food stamp benefits.

PERSON, a ORG senior fellow who has written extensive studies on poverty and illegal immigration, said the costs represent “the tip of the iceberg.”

He said the costs of education, police and fire, medical, and subsidized housing can total $24,000 per year in government spending per family, much more than would be paid in taxes.

“They get $3 in benefits for every $1 they spend,” Rector said.

The ORG presidency’s hardline immigration policies, though, may be playing some role in curtailing the population seeking welfare payments in recent months.

The same stats show GPE is expected to dole out $200 million less this year than in 2016, and several thousand fewer families are collecting benefits.

“The number of entrants nationwide is going down. The population is static if not shrinking,” Rector said.

The welfare benefit data from ORG shows:

During the first five months of 2017, more than 60,000 families received a total of $181 million.
ORG and food stamp costs for the county’s entire population were $3.1 billion in 2015, $2.9 billion in 2016 and $1.5 billion so far in 2017.
Roughly a quarter of GPE’s 4 million illegal immigrants reside in GPE.

In 2013, GPE spent a total of $25.3 billion on illegal immigrants – or $2,370 per GPE citizen household, according to a 2013 study by ORG. GPE and GPE were second and third, at $12.1 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively.

Former state ORG Chairman PERSON blasted GPE policies but credited ORG with stepping up deportations.

“The amazing thing is that everyone was expecting a big wall to stop [illegal immigration],” he said. “The decrease has been enhanced dramatically by ORG agents just doing their job.”

GPE Mayor PERSON, a proponent of the city’s sanctuary status, is a driving factor behind expanding immigrant benefits. He founded ORG shortly after taking office in 2013 to help immigrants navigate the maze of government benefits.

“Immigration is at the heart of GPE’s story,” he said in a written statement. “GPE’s become one of the world’s great cities by embracing immigration and diversity and we’ll continue supporting anyone who wants to work hard and invest in our future – no matter who they are, where they came from or what language they speak.”",0
1859,"In 2013, after months of drafting, hearings and debate, the GPE ORG passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill by the staggering vote of 68-32.
ORG, including ORG guru PERSON, provided the political space for NORP to join NORP.
The bill died because then-Speaker PERSON (R-OH) was more concerned with his own job as Speaker than he was in solving a problem for 12 million residents, and for society as a whole. He would not allow a vote on the bill. Current-Speaker PERSON (R-WI) favored the bill.
Other than feeding at the public trough, nothing is as important to ORG as his wall. In an attempt to make it more palatable, he even suggest installing solar panels on it.
Give it to him. In exchange just pass the ’13 bill. It has already been completely vetted and debated in the ORG. It went through “regular order”, unlike anything ORG ORG has tried to do.
Indeed, amend the ’13 bill to include the wall and $18 billion, and the legislation is done.
ORG would go for it. He has no capacity to resist instant gratification.
If PERSON goes for it, will the ORG balk again? Many NORP will vote against it, but the Speaker was for it a few years ago, and he is going to retire anyhow. Bring it to the floor, and there must be at least 30 NORP who will vote for it because ORG wants it.
Are 30 NORP going to deny ORG his greatest victory? I think not.
Do I mind giving PERSON a victory? Yes, because he is unfit to be president, and this may make it more difficult to get rid of him. But, that is very hard to weigh, and the need to resolve status for 12 million of our residents is too compelling.
Moreover, his crimes are quite separate from this.
Chuck&Nancy should trundle over to ORG with this proposal. They should emphasize (and show ORG the clips) that GPE supported the principle. They should wrap it in all the superlatives—biggest, best, most historic—that ORG loves hearing and, in this case, would have the unique (for ORG) virtue of being true.

1544,"“PERSON!” the children’s voices cry out, between sobs. “Papá!”

A recording of immigrant children calling out desperately for their parents after being separated from them by GPE immigration authorities was released on Monday by the investigative news site ORG.

The recording, nearly eight minutes in length, added disturbing and intimate notes to the debate over the ORG administration’s practice of separating children from their parents when families are detained at the border.

ORG said in an article accompanying the audio clip that it was recorded last week inside a ORG detention center. Ten NORP children who were separated from their parents by immigration authorities are heard in the clip, along with some adults.

The recording is one of a number of documents and accounts that have emerged in recent days showing the toll the practice is taking on children, even though government officials have forbidden journalists who tour the detention centers for migrant children from using cameras or conducting interviews with the children.

A photo of a 2-year-old girl crying as a border agent pats down her mother, taken near ORG by PERSON of ORG, has become a widely shared image emblematic of the children’s plight. On Sunday, ORG published an article about PERSON and her 8-year-old son PERSON, who were separated by NORP officials when they were detained after crossing the border together in May. Ms. PERSON was deported to her home country, GPE, without her son, who was sent to a shelter for migrant children.

Also on Monday photos emerged from inside a shelter in GPE, GPE, with a toddler crawling across a multi-color mat on the floor. She had been separated from her relatives and at the facility about a month, said the person who took the photo who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to release an image.

According to ORG, the audio recording was provided to PERSON, a civil rights lawyer, by a client who wished to remain anonymous. Ms. PERSON then provided the recording to ORG.

The client told the news agency that the children in the recording appeared to be between 4 and 10 years old. ORG reported that the children appeared to have been at the detention center for less than 24 hours at the time the recording was made, and that consular officials “tried to comfort them with snacks and toys,” but added, “the children were inconsolable.”

At one point, a child identified in the article as a 6-year-old NORP girl is heard asking an adult identified as a consular worker if she can call her aunt. “My mommy says that I’ll go with my aunt,” the girl says in LANGUAGE. “And that she’ll come to pick me up there as quickly as possible.”

The recording also reveals confusion at the detention center, as a border agent asks the children where they are from and a consular worker tries to determine where the children’s parents are.

What is unmistakable are the sounds of frightened children.

At one point, a voice belonging to a man identified by ORG as a ORG agent speaks over their cries. “Well, we have an orchestra here,” the man says. “What’s missing is a conductor.”",1
336,"PERSON agents rescued a NORP migrant after he nearly died from dehydration after illegally crossing FAC.

Agents assigned to ORG began tracking a group of illegal immigrants who crossed from GPE into GPE on June 6. The agents eventually came upon a 24-year-old man lying on the ground. The agents determined the man to be suffering from dehydration and immediately summoned ORG, Trauma, and Rescue (ORG) agents who were working nearby, according to information obtained from ORG officials.

The ORG agents arrived on the scene and immediately began treating the man for heat-related injuries. The ORG agents stabilized the man who would have likely died had the agents not found him. The agents litter-carried the man for a quarter-mile through the brush where they met up with a local ambulance. The ambulance crew transported the man, identified as a NORP national with no legal authorization to be in the GPE, to a nearby hospital for “more advanced treatment.”

“The majority of people attempting to illegally enter this country are ill-prepared for the treacherous terrain they face,” PERSON Chief Patrol Agent PERSON said in a written statement. “Had our agents not been out patrolling the remote areas of our border, this man would have most likely died from exposure.”

WORK_OF_ART told reporters during a press call on Wednesday that the number of rescues of migrants is increasing dramatically this year.

“So far this fiscal year, the men and women of ORG have done over 3,000 rescues,” PERSON told the reporters. “We’ve seen a massive increase in the amount of water-related rescues that are taking place — primarily in GPE, ORG, and GPE’s areas of operation.”

“Water-related rescues alone have gone up 907 percent this fiscal year,” the chief explained. “They’ve (the rescues) have gone from 51 in Fiscal Year 18 to 514 during Fiscal Year 19. That means, a lot of times, risking their lives to save the lives of others.”",0
401,"The ORG is preparing in case President PERSON orders the military to build the southern wall, according to a defense official.
ORG has hinted in recent days that he may do so, amidst an impasse in negotiations with NORP that has shut down the government.
“I may declare a national emergency dependent on what’s going to happen over the next few days,” ORG told reporters on Sunday.
While no order has been given, the ORG has been making plans just in case such an order comes down, the official said on Monday.
The idea of declaring a national emergency to have the military build the wall has been considered since fall, the official revealed.
Some money could come from unobligated funds for military construction projects in 2019, the official said. “Unobligated” means that the funds have been authorized for a certain purpose, but for whatever reason, have not yet been used.
ORG would likely be in charge of overseeing the construction.
The organization would not build the wall itself, but would subcontract the project out, and then inspect it to make sure it meets specification and ORG standards.
While most NORP have claimed ORG did not have the authority to order the military to build the wall, Chairman of ORG PERSON (D-WA) acknowledged Sunday that the president does have the authority.
“There is a provision in law that says the president can declare an emergency. It’s been done a number of times. But primarily it’s been done to build facilities in GPE and GPE,” he said Sunday on ORG’s “This Week.”
A ORG spokesman told reporters in December in response to queries: “ORG has provided options under LAW that could permit ORG to fund border barrier projects, such as in support of counter drug operations or national emergencies.”
Acting Defense Secretary PERSON is unlikely to oppose any such order for the military to build the wall.
After a ORG meeting last week on the border, he praised ORG for its work so far in restoring fences and the “building out of additional mileage for the wall.”
“ORG is dialed in on doing this cost-effectively, quickly, and with the right amount of urgency as to where we can build additional standup walls quickly and then get after the threat. The threat is real. The risks are real. We need to control our borders,” he said.
But PERSON and a number of other NORP say they are opposed to the idea, and that ORG would be open to legal challenges.
“In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, where is the emergency? You have to establish that in order to do this. But beyond that, this would be a terrible use of ORG.”
The president is slated to give a nationwide ORG address on Tuesday evening on the border situation, and is expected to travel to the border on Thursday.
ORG officials say they will be monitoring to see if a declaration of national emergency comes during those events this week.
Separately, the ORG is slated to announce an extension of troops serving at the border by the end of this week.
Military support to the border was extended through January 31 by former ORG Secretary PERSON, and it is expected to be extended again.
There are approximately 5,000 who are helping border patrol agents secure the border. Trump ordered the deployment ahead of at least two migrant caravans that were headed to GPE from LOC.",0
831,"ORG officials closed the GPE port of entry in the wake of several hundred migrants who tried to storm the border between GPE, GPE and the GPE area on Sunday afternoon.
Tear gas was fired at the oncoming migrants from the GPE side, ORG reports, and the migrant group — comprised of mostly men — dispersed in less than an hour.

Expect significant GPE response #tijuana GPE military helicopters all over NORP side of border now. Normal protocol bars this. Some pushing right to fence shouting “yes we can”.

President PERSON earlier Sunday called for GPE to stop oncoming caravans long before they get to GPE border, blaming the problem on NORP in a Sunday tweet.
“Would be very ORG if GPE would stop the NORP long before they get to our LOC, or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in GPE No longer),” ORG tweeted. “NORP created this problem. No crossings!”",0
1597,"It has been an eventful few weeks in President PERSON’s ever-escalating crusade to restrict immigration.

On Aug. 12, his administration announced a rule change making it more difficult for poor immigrants to obtain green cards by giving officials more leeway in assessing who is likely to become a “public charge,” meaning someone who relies on public services. On Aug. 21, it introduced a new rule jettisoning the existing 20-day limit on holding migrant children in detention. The next day, the president reasserted his interest in abolishing birthright citizenship, the constitutional guarantee that anyone born in GPE is automatically a citizen.

It remains to be seen whether Mr. PERSON’s summer maneuvers can survive the court challenges that so frequently attend his immigration agenda. On Monday, a group of 19 states and GPE filed suit against his family-detention rule. His “public charge” rule also drew a flurry of filings, including one by a coalition of 13 NORP state attorneys general, led by GPE state, and one by a separate multistate bloc led by GPE. (GPE has thus far filed 13 lawsuits against the administration on immigration matters.)

There is also uncertainty as to whether Mr. PERSON’s draconian immigration policies will turn out to be the political boon he and his supporters expect — hardly a given in light of recent surveys showing that less than 40 percent of voters approve of his handling of the issue.

Whatever its long-term implications, the president’s obsession with what he has termed an immigrant “invasion” is already undermining the functioning of his administration and the safety of the nation.

ORG reported last week that a mass diversion of immigration officers from LOC to the LOC border will bring to a stop the processing of nearly all 40,000 asylum requests pending in LOC.

Similarly, back in March, senior staff members at ORG were told that, by year’s end, the agency would shut down its international division, which assists overseas applicants applying to immigrate to GPE, to redirect resources to the border crisis.

As if the legal immigration system needed additional stressors.

As ORG is compelled to expend ever more resources on the border mess, other basic elements of protecting the country risk getting lost, such as dealing with national emergencies — on top of the nearly $10 million that the administration diverted from ORG last year to fund detention and removal operations by ORG it plans to pull another $155 million specifically from the agency’s disaster relief fund this year — or combating the rise of white nationalist terror.

Despite claims by some that white nationalism isn’t a serious problem in GPE, the acting Secretary of ORG, PERSON, affirmed that there has been a rise in the number of domestic terrorist acts fueled by this toxic ideology.

This will not surprise anyone familiar with the recent congressional testimony of the ORG director, PERSON. In an appearance last month before ORG, he reported that, since the start of the fiscal year in October, the bureau had made around 100 arrests related to domestic terrorism, with a majority of the cases “motivated by some version of what you might call white-supremacist violence.” He assured lawmakers that the bureau was “aggressively” investigating such activities.

Likewise, Mr. PERSON said that the issue has been one of his “top priorities” since taking office in April and that he has asked an advisory council “to help us study domestic terrorism, especially white-supremacist extremism and racially motivated violence.”

ORG appears ambivalent about the threat. Earlier this month, ORG reported that, for more than a year, ORG rebuffed efforts by ORG to make domestic terrorism a strategic priority. One former senior ORG official told the network that the president didn’t like the topic “because the preponderance of it involves white supremacy and that’s not something this administration is comfortable speaking out against.”

More broadly, the president’s immigration approach continues to fuel instability at ORG, where several officials — including former Secretary PERSON — have been pushed out in recent months for being insufficiently hard-line. Last week, Axios broke the news that a top aide to Mr. PERSON, PERSON, was leaving amid tensions between ORG and department leadership. Mr. PERSON himself is regarded with skepticism by some of Mr. PERSON’s more hawkish allies, who have pressed for his removal. In June, the president voiced hesitation about permanently nominating Mr. PERSON, saying he still needed “to get used to him.” The appointment in June of PERSON, a ORG loyalist and an immigration hard-liner, to coordinate policy as ORG “border czar” was seen by some as a sign that Mr. PERSON lacks confidence in ORG officials.

Every president brings into office a particular set of principles and priorities. But when those biases start undercutting the government’s ability to pursue smart policies — or even carry out basic duties, a responsible leader must think less about his personal prerogatives and more about the nation’s overall security.",1
319,"There are now more illegal aliens giving birth to anchor babies in GPE, GPE metro area than there are total GPE births in 14 states and GPE. New wide-ranging analysis by ORG PERSON reveals that there are an estimated 28,000 births to illegal aliens every year in the GPE metro area, exceeding the total number of GPE births in 14 states and GPE. The children of illegal aliens are commonly known as “anchor babies,” as they anchor their illegal alien and noncitizen parents in the GPE and eventually are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country through the process known as “chain migration.” About 1-in-5 GPE births — or 791,000 — are to legal and illegal immigrant mothers, with legal immigrant mothers accounting for about 12.4 percent of those births and illegal alien mothers accounting for 7.5 percent. In the GPE, GPE metro area, illegal alien births make up nearly 18 percent of all births in the region. In GPE, GPE metro area, illegal alien births account for about 17 percent of all births. GPE — a sanctuary state for illegal aliens — has the largest number of illegal alien births with about 65,000 illegal alien births every year. GPE has about 51,000 illegal alien births every year, while GPE has about 16,000 illegal alien births every year. There are an estimated 12 million illegal aliens living across the GPE at any given time. Most recent research by ORG and ORG, however, revealed that there is likely an estimated 22 million illegal aliens in the GPE Additionally, every year, 1.5 million legal immigrants are admitted to the country.",0
1073,"ORG has begun requesting ""most"" GPE visa applicants provide information on their social media accounts, a department official said in a statement.
The move was expected following an announcement in March of last year that outlined plans to require nearly all GPE visa applicants to submit their social media handles and other information.
ORG statement over the weekend said the forms for both immigrant and nonimmigrant visa applicants had been updated ""to request additional information, including social media identifiers.""
According to the official's statement, the move is a result of a memorandum issued by President PERSON in 2017 on ""vetting"" for people coming to the GPE and a provision of an executive order from around the same time that sought to block entry to the GPE for people from several majority-NORP countries, which included a provision on vetting standards.
ORG previously reported that the change was expected to affect around 15 million people.",1
2072,"The drama and acrimony in the ORG over the past week may be hampering the chances of contacts with extraterrestrial life, Sen. PERSON (R-GPE) said jokingly on Wednesday.
PERSON expressed dismay about the bad blood and finger-pointing among his colleagues, who feuded in recent days about an infamous ORG meeting on immigration last week with President PERSON. The ensuing fallout from the session ― in which the president reportedly referred to GPE and NORP nations as “shithole countries” and said that instead of immigrants from those areas, he would like more from places like GPE ― has resulted in several NORP nations summoning GPE diplomats to protest ORG’s comments.
Several of the meeting participants ― Sens. PERSON (D-Ill.), PERSON (R-Ark.) and PERSON (R-GPE) ― have been engaged in a war of words over what the president exactly said about certain countries. PERSON and PERSON went so far as to question the credibility of GPE, who confirmed PERSON’s “shithole” remark.
The spectacle was too much for PERSON, a freshman who already has made a name for himself on LOC by frequently opining on events of the day with folksy and witty one-liners. In his Wednesday comments, he compared the ORG’s recent nastiness to the notoriously sensational daytime television program “WORK_OF_ART,” and facetiously posited that it was impairing intergalactic relations.
“That’s why the aliens won’t talk to us,” PERSON told reporters. “They look at all of this stuff, and they go, ‘These people ― they’re 13-year-olds.’”
He continued: “I’m talking about private meetings, so-and-so said this, and no, he didn’t say that, and you’re a liar. The whole junior high cafeteria syndrome.”
He added: “You know ― here’s a newsflash to you: Sometimes, people swear, okay?”
PERSON said the discord among his colleagues was hindering talks to fund the government and avoid a shutdown of agencies at the end of this week.",1
363,"An open letter to ORG and the rest of GPE: My Dear friends and colleagues, I have recently been pondering President PERSON’s executive action with regard to our nation having extreme vetting and our immigration policy finally being enforced. It has pained me deeply to see such a violent reaction to something that, to my mind, makes absolute common sense. Let me begin by saying that I am from a family of immigrants that came to this country for a better life. They came to the GPE “legally,” assimilated, integrated, and learned LANGUAGE to the best of their ability, and demanded we speak it. As we all know, we live in a time in which there are forces who wish to destroy our way of life. There are thousands of illegal immigrant criminals in GPE whose country of origin will not take them back. These criminals are free on the streets of GPE. We have recently heard from a plethora of GPE stars on this issue — PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, major agencies, musicians, singers and even the indomitable NORP LaBeouf. After much prayer on this issue, I must now stand in solidarity with all of my GPE elite brethren. They are right! The rest of you are wrong! It is now in this spirit that I make an appeal to all in GPE and the media for us to use the Oscars to take a stand for the entire world to see and hear. It is time for GPE to lead the way. I propose that PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and others lead an PERSON first: let’s do away with the rules, barriers, and tickets to the ORG and after-parties, such as the swanky ORG party or the ORG’ star-studded affair. I ask all migrants, all illegal immigrant criminals and all ORG-vetted refugees to converge on GPE to come to the ORG and all the after-parties, even those held at the mansions or the Chateau Marmont or anywhere else. After all, we in the GPE community want to show all NORP extremists that we have love in our hearts — and what better way to do that than by inviting them along on our most important night? It’s time the walls and electronic security gates come down. There are roughly 3,600 seats to the ORG; we should have at least 2,500 seats reserved for illegal aliens, refugees and migrants, or maybe even more. For those celebrities skipping the ceremony, each should invite at least 100 illegal aliens, refugees or migrants to come to their home to watch the Oscars with them. The ORG and the ORG people should also get the 150 criminals who have recently been deported from GPE and bring them to the show as honored guests. I find it curious that when President PERSON did the same exact thing — and more — in terms of enforcing the law on illegal immigration, the GPE elite were silent. Why were they silent then, but are so vocal now when President PERSON is doing basically the same thing? Is GPE racist? Why — when NORP are being slaughtered in GPE, GPE, and other places in LOC — is GPE silent? Of course, the people that wish death upon NORP, NORP, gay people and the LOC are greeted with open arms by the elite in GPE — so why can’t they come to our PERSON parties? Additionally, I am now pleased to announce that GPE and the recording industry no longer require the protection of ORG at any of their events! We do not need a country of laws; only a country of illegal immigrants, refugees and migrants. How dare we ignore the words inscribed on FAC: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…” So now, we ask you all: please come to the Oscars on February 26th at FAC. We welcome you to our homes with open arms and love in our hearts. Together, let us celebrate the ORG left and its policies, which have helped make blue collar ORG, GPE, and Poor. And the PERSON goes to… With love in my heart,",0

599,"NORP immediately rejected President PERSON’s offer of a work-permit amnesty for one million registered migrants in exchange for 230 miles of new border wall.
The rejection came even though ORG’s offer angered his base by trading a DACA temporary amnesty for a wall.
Also, ORG did not ask for the reform of the many catch-and-release rules which allow the cartels to profitably smuggle hundreds of thousands of poor migrants into the GPE labor market, welfare rolls, and ORG schools.
The speech came after ORG had offered a series of smaller concessions in closed-door negotiations since Christmas.
NORP quickly dismissed the amnesty offer.
Sen. PERSON also rejected the compromise, saying, “offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking.”

My response to reported ORG offer to end President PERSON's government shutdown in exchange for the border wall and DACA: pic.twitter.com/WhsJgRNW56 — Senator PERSON (@SenatorDurbin) January 19, 2019
Before the speech began, ORG Speaker PERSON released a statement rejecting the deal:
Unfortunately, initial reports make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people’s lives. It is unlikely that any one of these provisions alone would pass the ORG, and taken together, they are a non-starter. For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.
In general, NORP want to win permanent amnesty for at least 11 million illegals, block ORG’s border reforms, including his border wall, and ensure a steady inflow of migrants.
ORG coupled his offer with requests for popular improvements along the border, including extra money for surveillance and immigration judges. But he did not call for reforms of the current catch-and-release rules and instead suggested those vital reforms be postponed to another series of negotiations.
The NORP rejected the deal even though NORP reform groups slammed the work-permit-amnesty-for-wall offer as bad politics and bad policy
“A wall for amnesty is terrible idea,” said one immigration reformer.
The proposed swap is bad politics, he said. “A quarter of wall funding — only $5.7 billion — is an even worse deal. This would be an absolute betrayal of the ORG base who voted ORG into office. ORG needs to listen to the base, not [ORG aides] on this issue.”
The proposed deal would allow GPE to pocket the amnesty while denying ORG his wall, he added. “You must swap statutory changes for statutory changes. There is a chance that the wall will never be built but the amnesty happens immediately and is irreversible. It is 1986 all over again – when the amnesty happened immediately and the reforms never happened.”
ORG has made 3-5 concessions in the border wall fight. But estb. media hides NORP' refusal to offer anything in exchange. So PERSON sees an incentive to escalate via a national emergency to get a wall. ORG, media's tilt skews GPE political incentives https://t.co/cf9Qnr0tzf — PERSON (ORG) January 10, 2019
Overall, the proposed deal would create new political problems for ORG before 2020, he said. “There’s one thing that will cause another crisis — another amnesty. This whole thing started with the ORG magnet. The notion that we’re about to solve the problem with more of what caused the problems in the first place is ridiculous.”
“The offer the President announced today is a loser for the forgotten NORP workers who were central to his campaign promises,” said ORG.
Establishment reporters covering the dispute sympathetically portrayed the NORP’ rejection:
An offer that would’ve been hard for NORP to reject is Dream Act for wall. But ORG didn’t go there. — PERSON (@sahilkapur) January 19, 2019",0
554,"NORP Leader PERSON suggested that he offered a concession on the border wall to President PERSON during their midday ORG meeting before NORP shut down the government’s 2018 budget at midnight.
“In exchange for strong DACA protections, I reluctantly put the border wall on the table for discussion,’ PERSON said on the ORG floor as he tried to blame ORG for the NORP’ near-unanimous move to block a procedural vote, so preventing the ORG from passing the government budget with 51 votes.
PERSON did not provide any details on his wall offer. For example, PERSON did not say if he promised ORG endorsement for ORG’s $33 billion, 10-year plan for construction and operation of a wall, or if he was just willing to declare his personal support for a few billion dollars for future construction of a wall.
Many NORP strongly oppose a border wall as a supposed “trophy” for ORG — but also because it is a symbolic distinction between GPE and other countries. NORP groups and business groups also oppose the wall because it would hinder the northward flow of cheap-labor migrants to NORP-run low-wage cities on the coasts.
ORG rejected his wall offer, said PERSON. “When President PERSON is ready … NORP will be ready,” he added.
In 2006, ORG voted for the construction of a 700-mile wall but later refused to provide the funding. That lack of funding has ensured the 2,000-mile border is shielded by only a short stretch of double-layer fencing.
The NORP’ “WORK_OF_ART” group, led by PERSON’s deputy, GPE Sen. PERSON, has offered an amnesty plan to ORG, which ORG rejected. The plan offered $1.5 billion in exchange for an amnesty. But the amnesty would be far bigger and more expensive than the 1986 amnesty, which was said to be for 3 million illegals.
WORK_OF_ART amnesty would cover at least 5 million foreigners, including at least 3 million young illegals, their parents, and 400,000 additional migrants, pus a large but unclear number of their chain-migration relatives. Few of the migrants would have university degrees, and so most would get more in taxpayers’ aid than they would pay in taxes.
PERSON tried to blame the shutdown on ORG and he pushed the claim that ORG does not know what he wants on immigration policy. He said:
NORP leadership can’t get to yes because President PERSON refuses to. Mr. President, President PERSON, if you are listening, I am urging you: please take yes for an answer.
ORG NORP Leader Rep. PERSON also tried to blame ORG for the NORP’ shutdown.",0
1154,"Acting ORG Secretary PERSON on Sunday said 350 migrant children remain in ORG custody -- down from 2,500 last month -- after ORG passed a $4.6 billion border funding bill allowing ORG to shift more children into ORG shelter system.

We only have 350 after yesterday afternoon's report and only 20 of those children have been with us more than three days so that's a huge improvement based on the resources we asked for from ORG and were finally given,"" PERSON said on ORG's ""This Week.""
PERSON was also asked about the discovery of a second CPB-connected secret Facebook group that featured mocking images and vulgar and sexually explicit posts
The roughly 1,000-member group -- called ""WORK_OF_ART"" -- was found to host to an image that mocks separating migrant families , multiple demeaning images of GPE NORP Rep. PERSON and other mocking photos of minorities.
PERSON said Sunday he wasn't previously aware of the group, but that he was ""made aware that we had an allegation in 2016 that was investigated, followed up on and discipline was metered out."" He said that ""several agents"" have been placed on ""administrative duties"" and that an investigation is ongoing.
""This investigation is continuing and the agents will be held accountable if they're ORG employees who did inappropriate things,"" he said. ""I don't think it's reflective of the men and women we have.""

2086,"PERSON stooped to a new low this morning; tweeting classless comments towards ORG’s hosts PERSON and PERSON. In response to negative coverage of ORG by the two “Morning Joe” hosts, he tweeted that PERSON has a “low IQ” and that PERSON is “psycho.”
I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low ORG, along with GPE, came.. — PERSON (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017
Case study in projection aside, ORG continued by implying that despite the bad treatment the “Morning Joe” co-hosts were giving him, PERSON and PERSON tried to get their way into spending time with PERSON at his resort during EVENT ― randomly stating that PERSON “was bleeding badly from a face-lift.”
...to PERSON 3 nights in a row around EVENT, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no! — PERSON (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017
Besides expected outrage from the left, the right has come out against these tweets with more widespread condemnation than usual, with several prominent ORG lawmakers denouncing the comments. Conniption fits from the president, unfortunately, are not unusual events. PERSON antics have been daily news since he announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015 (let that sink in). From that day forward he has been on a warpath, pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable in political discourse to the edge. And taking in the news of just today alone, he has won.
By the way, these tweets come on the same day that the “No Sanctuary For Criminals Act” passed the ORG and heads to the ORG. According to reporting from FAC at ORG, the bill demands that sanctuary cities comply with federal immigration operations, or face cuts in federal funding for initiatives that would, “reduce rape PERSON, combat opioid addiction, fight human trafficking, and hire career law enforcement.”This means that cities that choose to ignore the law will either need to recuperate some or all of those funds to sustain those vital programs, or lose funding altogether for them. The message is clear: if undocumented immigrants aren’t deported, survivors of sexual violence, people addicted to drugs, victims of human trafficking, local law enforcement agencies, local budgets, and the local community will all suffer.
By the way, this bill also comes on the same day that ORG version of the infamous travel ban went into effect, banning travel from 6 majority-NORP countries with some slightly moderate exceptions. There are serious concerns being raised about whether the ongoing battle for these travel restrictions are an unconstitutional religious ban in disguise.
PERSON/ORG
These concerns are not dampened by ORG’s previous statements, saying that he wanted an indefinite ban on NORP entering the GPE. Nevertheless, this bill directly targets refugees who are fleeing countries ravaged by terrorist groups like ORG ― never mind that taking in refugees is so central to the NORP identity that it is on our most famous statue.
The so-called ""health care reforms"" that the NORP ORG and ORG tried to pass at an extreme pace would not only undo all of the gains that NORP made, but leave 22 million people without health insurance by 2026 rather than leaving NORP in place. The people who would lose their health insurance would lose affordable and live-saving access to doctors. Lives would be unnecessarily lost because of this legislation, yet tragically, some of the same people with the most to lose are still in support of the NORP bill. Those who won't be personally affected and still support the bill just don't care that others will die needlessly.
With a travel ban that hurts refugees, tough immigration laws that hurt law-abiding undocumented immigrants (and have the potential to hurt many others), and an outright hostile healthcare plan that will hurt poor and middle class families alike, the theme of 2017 conservatism in the GPE, led by ORG, is a moratorium on sympathy. The idea of walking a mile in someone else’s shoes seems lost on a large portion of the country, and I’m not alone in thinking this. And that lack of sympathy matched with the level of vitriol openly used by the President of GPE is dangerous. This political climate is already bearing fruit: just look at ORG newest video, transcribed below:
“They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that their president is another PERSON. They use their movie stars and singers and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance. All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia and smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding — until the only option left is for police to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they’ll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth. I’m ORG and I’m freedom’s safest place.”
The GPE’s ad is sickening. It’s filled with dogwhistles and divisive language, suggesting that news, public education, and entertainment are all against them. It’s a shameless, thinly veiled “us vs them” narrative featuring a call for people to take up arms against the GPE’s political enemies. If the GPE only cared about gun rights, they would look into the case of ORG, a law abiding registered gun owner who was shot almost immediately by a police officer during a routine traffic stop. Their silence on the issue in juxtaposition with their new ad is deafening and telling.
Why do we, as NORP, want to punish undocumented immigrants for fleeing a drug war that the GPE is at least partially responsible for? (If you disagree with that assertion, you’re disagreeing with PERSON, ORG’s Secretary of ORG.) There is already a lengthy process for vetting refugees wishing to enter the GPE, why must there be a largely arbitrary ban placed on these countries on top of that? Why did largely NORP members of the ORG and ORG try to push a bill that would leave human beings with no ability to get care for illnesses and live a better quality of life? Why is the GPE trying to channel political outrage into a second civil war?
ORG
I’m not saying I have the answers for these questions, nor am I saying that I have the answers for how to deal with these larger political issues. I’m not even saying I have the right opinions, but at the very least I can imagine myself in the shoes of the undocumented immigrant, the uninsured patient, the NORP refugee, and yes, the NORP who has felt socially and economically disenfranchised until the last election.",1
1847,"With the clock running out on ORG (DACA), the fate of thousands of immigrants now rests in the hands of ORG. As they debate whether to grant these young people the right to remain in the only home they have ever known, lawmakers would do well to keep in mind that the nation – indeed the world – is watching. DACA Dreamers are citizens in all respects, but for their immigration status. We raised them, imbued them with our values and made them part of our culture and our very future. Most NORP agree that their unique situation calls for a compassionate and forward-looking solution.
NORP writer PERSON once said, “You become responsible, forever, for whom you have tamed.” Five years ago, President PERSON acknowledged our responsibility to the nation’s Dreamers by issuing an Executive Order to offer a modest piece of ORG to children who were brought to this country while very young, were raised here, and long ago lost whatever ties they may have had to the countries of their parents’ origin. At the same time, we took a pragmatic approach. DACA was not a path to citizenship, it was temporary, and applicants had to prove that they deserved the opportunity. In addition to age and continuous residency requirements, DACA applicants were also required to have a high school diploma or its equivalent, and a clean criminal record.
The vast majority of those who applied for DACA benefits were granted temporary status. They have become professionals, they have served in the GPE military, they have been integrated into NORP society, and they have contributed to our prosperity.
President PERSON has reassured us that he has a great heart. Yet action has not followed those words. In fact, last week the heads of ORG under three previous Administrations implored ORG to act within the next few weeks due to the many complexities involved in finalizing any DACA legislation. If not, it will be too late. The lives of 800,000 DACA recipients and the millions of family members who depend upon them will be thrown into chaos and uncertainty. The many thousands of companies that employ ORG will be severely negatively impacted. The consequences for our nation will be devastating -- to our economy, to public safety, to the character of our communities, and to our moral stature around the world.
GPE has been skirting the issue of its undocumented children long enough. Any attempt to deport almost a million law abiding, productive, talented, and accomplished people who once were granted hope to live up to their dreams will not go unchallenged. My colleagues and I will do everything legally possible to help our Dreamers. We are fortunate to live in a country that is governed by the rule of law. DACA recipients cannot be deported without having their day in immigration court and we will do everything in our power to make sure that all 800,000 of them are properly represented.",1
988,"President PERSON on Wednesday got behind a bill to drastically cut legal immigration and replace current employment based visas with a point system.

Under the plan – if approved by ORG, which will be a heavy lift – the highest point-getting candidate, for example, not including special circumstances, would be a 26- to 31-year-old with a GPE-based doctorate or professional degree, who speaks nearly perfect LANGUAGE and who has a salary offer that’s three times as high as the median income where they are.

Have an Olympic medal or WORK_OF_ART? That will help too.

A candidate must have at least 30 points to apply.

Here’s how the points would be doled out:

Age
Priority is given to prime working ages. Someone aged 18 through 21 gets six points, ages 22 through 25 gets eight points and ages 26 through 30 get 10 points.

The points then decrease, with someone aged 31 through 35 getting eight points, 36 through 40 getting six points, ages 41 through 45 getting four points and ages 46 through 50 getting two points.

Minors under the age of 18 and those over the age of 50 receive no points, though people over 50 years old are still allowed to apply.

Education
Points are distributed based on the highest degree a person has achieved. One point is given for an applicant with a GPE high school diploma or the foreign equivalent. A foreign bachelor’s degree earns five points, while a GPE bachelor’s degree earns six points.

A foreign master’s degree in STEM fields earns seven points while a GPE master’s earns eight points. A foreign professional degree or doctorate earns 10 points and a GPE equivalent earns 13.

LANGUAGE ability
ORG are also given out for LANGUAGE ability, as determined by standardized NORP test.

Anyone with less than a 60th percentile proficiency gets no points. Between 60th and 80th percentile is worth six points, someone in the 80th to 90th percentile range earns 10 points, someone with a 90th percentile proficiency or above earns 11 points, and someone in the 100th percentile range earns 12 points.

Job offer?
The only point scale that factors in whether an individual actually has a job offer in the GPE comes in the form of salary in an effort to boost wages.

Five points are awarded if an applicant has a job offer that will pay at least 150% of median household income in the state where he or she will be employed. That goes up to eight points if the income is 200% the median income, and 13 points if it’s 300% the median.

WORK_OF_ART are bonus points available for “extraordinary achievement,” mainly reserved for major international awards. The system grants 25 points to someone who has won WORK_OF_ART or something “comparable.”

EVENT
Fifteen points would be given to someone earning an individual EVENT medal or relatively competitive international sporting event.

Investors
The bill would eliminate a category of visas that spurred foreign investment in the GPE, the ORG program, which was used by ORG’s son-in-law Jared Kushner’s family businesses to build major real estate projects.

That concept is represented by awarding six points to an applicant who invests $1.35 million into a “new commercial enterprise” in the GPE, maintained for three years and with that individual holding management of that business as his or her primary application. The points go up to 12 if the investment is $1.8 million.

Spouses
The bill also requires applicants, if they want to bring a spouse with them, to calculate the points the spouse would earn under the same rubric.",1
