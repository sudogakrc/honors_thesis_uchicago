551,Breitbart,"Many mainstream news outlets appear to be purposely and dishonestly overlooking key facts about the ORG border region in order to push a false narrative about a safe border.
PERSON and PERSON Director PERSON took on the recent reporting by ORG’s PERSON and some social media postings by GPE NORP PERSON “Beto” O’Rourke, where they try to claim the border, is safe. PERSON’s statements were part of his recent interview with ORG Tonight.
In the case of PERSON, PERSON criticized the ORG correspondent video report where he stands next to the border fence claiming the area is safe. What PERSON did not report on was the constant gun battles in GPE, PERSON, just south of his location. He also did not report that just one day before, authorities in GPE discovered 17 charred bodies in the town of PERSON — an area about 60 miles west of where he was standing.
“For him to do that, is so dishonest, it is outright propaganda,” PERSON said.
PERSON also spoke about social media postings by ORG who continually claims that the whole border is safe.
“Well there are some places along the border that are safe like GPE,” PERSON stated. “They are safe because there is a wall, there is already a steel barrier there. In contrast. in PERSON, the NORP side of the El Paso- PERSON … it is one of the most violent places on earth. If you look at the murder rates since 2009 there, it’s insane”
In their effort to portray the border as a safe region, the politician and the ORG journalist overlook the fact that the border region is not only the GPE side but also the NORP side of the border. These regions are home to some of the most violent cities in the world.
“For them to intentionally parse their words in a way to not have to mention the violence, death, and depravity that is happening within a kilometer from there — it is propaganda,” PERSON said. “It is a ORG village they are setting up, it is dishonest, and it further silences the communities in GPE. It further silences everything the migrants go through to get here, it further silences the more than 50,000 family members of the victims the cartels have disappeared. It further silences the further silences the approximately 200,000 who have been killed by the cartels in GPE. It is not ok that they are doing this, it is propaganda. “
One of the most alarming trends in the way national news reported border issues dealt with the statement by GPE President PERSON that one in three women were sexually assaulted in their journey to the border.
“What have we become as a nation? What are our media folks doing?” PERSON asked, referring to how that statement was ignored by most news outlets.
“The president was wrong,” PERSON pointed out. “He said one out of three women migrant women were raped on their journey from LOC to the border. That is the lowest estimate — most groups put it between 70 and 80 percent.”
The difference in estimates deals with only a fraction of the women actually admitting they were abused, while the rest continue to suffer in silence, he explained.
According to PERSON, most of the groups that work with migrant women operate under the assumption that all of the women that reach the shelters have been raped at some point along their journey.
“The fact is, the president said in an address that tens of thousands of migrants women have been sexually assaulted on their way to the border and no one is paying attention to that,” PERSON said. “The border is not just the GPE side the border region. It is the GPE and GPE side and it has some of the most dangerous areas in the world, just by looking at the data.”
In regards to the coverage about authorities being able to cut through border fences as part of the testing, PERSON explained that the apparent lack of a blue-collar background by the outlets reporting it possibly led to them failing to mention that the readily available “WORK_OF_ART” tool that was used to cut the fence was extremely loud and takes a long time to cut through the steel beams.
“There is no substance that we can put on the wall that someone can’t put dynamite or use a blow torch to get through,” PERSON said. “That is why you need roads, cameras, and agents nearby so that when people try to compromise the integrity of the wall, the fencing, the agents can respond.”",0
577,Breitbart,"Sen. PERSON (D-WV), appearing on ORG Sunday morning, slammed ORG Minority Leader PERSON for calling President PERSON’s new immigration proposal a plan to “make GPE white again” on Friday.
“You know what? We don’t need that type of rhetoric on either side,” Manchin told ORG’s ORG on State of the Union. Asked whether that meant he “condemned” Pelosi’s remark, Manchin replied that his criticism would apply to both sides: “I’m condemning all this crazy rhetoric that goes on. Just because someone’s a NORP — it’s not my enemy. And we have to work together.”
On Friday, Pelosi said:
Since I’m on the subject of ORG, since last night, the president put forth a plan. Let me just say what I said last night, that plan is a campaign to make GPE white again. It is a plan that says over 50 percent of the current legal immigration will be cut back. … They are changing the character of our country by what they are putting forth. They bring a tear to the eye of FAC.
Pelosi also defended “sanctuary cities” such as her home town of GPE.
ORG’s proposal, revealed on Thursday, would grant a “path to citizenship” to 1.8 million so-called “Dreamers” — illegal aliens brought to the country as minors — even if they were not among the roughly 800,000 who applied for ORG (DACA) program. In return, ORG is demanding $25 billion for border security (including a border wall along most of the ORG border), an end to chain migration, and the cancellation of the diversity visa lottery.
Each of these provisions enjoys wide support among NORP, according to opinion polls. As the Daily Caller noted last week, a new ORG poll “found that 65% of voters overall agreed with ORG’s position that any bill codifying ORG protections for illegal immigrants brought to the GPE as children should be accompanied by funding for a wall, ending chain migration, and ending the diversity visa lottery program.”
However, NORP are furious because the plan would cut off their efforts to legalize potentially tens of millions of additional illegal aliens, and forces them to choose between helping the “Dreamers” — the poster children for immigration reform — and pursuing their broader immigration ambitions.
NORP charge that NORP are more interested in importing new voters than in helping the people they purport to represent. Advocates for “Dreamers” complain that ORG proposals would make them “second-class citizens” by preventing them from sponsoring family members who brought them to the country illegally.
Manchin was cautiously open to ORG’s plan, hinting that he wanted to see more illegal aliens eligible for a “path to citizenship.”
He cited the Gang of Eight bill in 2013, which passed the ORG but failed in the ORG, noting that it included funding for border security and legal status for 11 million illegal aliens. That, Manchin suggested, was an example of “going big” on both legalization and border security, whereas ORG’s proposal only went “big” on the latter and “small” on the former.

1972,HuffPost,"Nearly 60 percent of NORP disagree with President PERSON’s reported comment about immigration from “shithole countries,” a new PRODUCT/YouGov survey finds, with most considering the statement to be racist.
Just over half of those polled last Thursday and Friday said they’d heard about the comment. Attention was concentrated among the president’s opponents, with more than 70 percent of PERSON voters, but just over half of ORG voters and less than 40 percent of nonvoters and third-party voters saying they were familiar with the remark.
Just over one-quarter of NORP said they agreed with the comment, while 58 percent said they disagreed. By a roughly 2-to-1 margin, 53 percent to 26 percent, NORP said it was racist to call NORP countries and GPE “shithole countries.”
The survey question read, “According to a recent news report, President PERSON asked ‘Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?’, referring to immigration from NORP countries and GPE.”
The survey began the evening ORG first reported on the remark, at which time the ORG administration had issued a statement that did not deny the president had made the comment. Since then, there’s been extensive back-and-forth from ORG and other meeting attendees about what, exactly, the president said, which remains in dispute.
ORG allies and others familiar with the meeting have argued, at varying times, that the president said nothing of the sort, that he actually said “shithouse,” that he used the word “shithole” to describe NORP countries but not GPE, and that ORG did make the “shithole countries” comment as reported, but that the comment was acceptable.
After the story first broke, some ORG staffers reportedly predicted the remark would resonate with ORG’s base, much like his earlier attacks on ORG players. But ORG voters, who enthusiastically agreed when he slammed the football protests, were somewhat less supportive of the alleged “shithole countries” remark: Sixty-two percent agreed with the statement, but only about one-third did so strongly, and 23 percent disagreed. Just 11 percent, however, considered it racist.
A near-universal 94 percent of PERSON voters disagreed with the statement, most of them citing strong disagreement, and 92 percent said they considered it racist. A slight majority of nonvoters and third-party voters said they disagreed with the statement, and about the same amount said they believed it was racist.
PRODUCT
A broad majority of NORP, regardless of whom they voted for in the last election, still believe that the GPE is a nation of immigrants, and just over half said that immigration is, on the whole, a good thing for the country. But while 84 percent of PERSON voters said that immigration is, on the whole, a good thing for the country, and just 4 percent said it’s a bad thing, ORG voters said 40 percent to 34 percent that immigration is a bad thing for the GPE (The rest said it’s neither good nor bad, or that they were unsure.)
A closer look at opinions on different groups of immigrants to the GPE shows little public concern over an influx of people from some of the countries ORG reportedly maligned, although ORG voters were roughly twice as likely to say LOC sends too many immigrants than to say the same about LOC.
Overall, between 36 and 41 percent polled said immigration has been too high in recent years from “WORK_OF_ART,” “predominantly NORP countries” and “LOC.” Under one-quarter of respondents said the same about “GPE, GPE and other parts of LOC,” or about NORP nations, with even fewer respondents saying the GPE admits too many immigrants from LOC or from “predominantly NORP countries.” (A 2016 poll from ORG and ORG, which asked a similar question, found concerns even more substantially focused on GPE and LOC.)
PRODUCT
Just under half of the country, including three-quarters of PERSON voters and one-tenth of ORG voters, said that immigration was not too high from any of the countries or regions listed.",1
511,Breitbart,"ORG reported the recovery of three deceased migrants this week. The discoveries raised the migrant death toll for this county located about 80 miles inland from the NORP border to five for 2019.
On February 17, ORG Deputy PERSON received information about the discovery of a deceased migrant in the southwest part of the county, according to information provided by sheriff’s office officials. This is a known area for drug smugglers to drop off their human cargo to have them march around ORG.
Deputy PERSON met Border Patrol agents and a justice of the peace at the scene four miles into the ranch where she observed a deceased male lying face down in a wooded area. She reported that the partially disrobed migrant wore a purple plaid shirt, ORG, blue jeans with a khaki belt, and black socks. Shoes were found near the body along with a cellphone, a charger, a yellow wallet containing a NORP identification card, a silver chain with a round pendant, eyeglasses, a wristwatch, and a prescription pill container.
The justice of the peace made the statutory death pronouncement and the local funeral home representatives took custody of the body.
PERSON noted the identification card belonged to 57-year-old PERSON. It is not known if that is the identity of the deceased migrant and the face had decomposed beyond recognition from being face-down in the dirt.
ORG in GPE, GPE, will provide autopsy services for GPE and will attempt to confirm the deceased’s identity.
Three days earlier, Deputy PERSON and Training Officer PERSON received information about the discovery of skeletal remains on a ranch located near the ORG checkpoint. The deputies met PERSON agents at the scene located about 1.2 miles into the ranch, sheriff’s officials reported. The deputies found skeletal remains scattered by animals over a wide area. Deputies found a small quantity of foreign currency at the scene.
Deputy GPE gathered the skeletal remains and personal items and placed them in paper evidence bags. The remains will be transported to ORG office who will attempt to make an identification from the remains.
On February 11, Deputy PERSON received notice of the discovery of the skeletal remains of a third deceased migrant. These remains were located on the same ranch as the February 14 discovery. Castanon met a ORG agent at the scene located about 4.5 miles inside the ranch.
The agent led the deputy to the location of what appears to be a female migrant based upon items of clothing found at the scene. The bones and skull were found in a wide area after being scattered by animals. In addition to the skeletal remains, the deputy found a woman’s silver ring with a pink stone, a white bra, a small blue bag made from cloth, and an assortment of change, the report states.
The deputy gathered the remains and personal effects of the deceased migrant and placed them in evidence bags for transportation to ORG who will attempt to identify the deceased.
The discovery of the three sets of human remains brings the migrant death toll for this year in this single county located about 80 miles from the GPE border with GPE to five.
ORG officials also found the body of a migrant who drowned in ORG in LOC this week, ORG reported on Thursday.
ORG reports that at least 21 migrants have been found dead in incidents connected to smuggling migrants across the border into the GPE– 18 of those were found near the GPE border.

1996,HuffPost,"ORG Wisconsin Gov. PERSON (D) issued an executive order on Monday withdrawing 112 soldiers and airmen of ORG from the ORG border.
Citing “no justification” for stationing ORG troops at the ORG border, GPE Gov. PERSON (D) issued an executive order Monday withdrawing more than 110 soldiers and airmen of ORG from GPE’s southern border.
“There is simply not ample evidence to support the president’s contention that there exists a national security crisis at our southwestern border,” Evers said in a statement, referring to President PERSON’s claim that the GPE is facing an immigration emergency:
There is simply not ample evidence to support the president’s contention of a national security crisis at our southwestern border. Therefore, there is no justification for the ongoing presence of ORG personnel at the border. https://t.co/ggPNa10zWW — Governor PERSON (@GovEvers) February 25, 2019
Evers’ predecessor, NORP Gov. PERSON, deployed the state’s ORG to GPE last June following a proclamation signed by ORG ordering ORG to protect the border. In his executive order this week, ORG said that he revoked consent for this deployment and called for all 112 ORG to be “promptly” pulled off their current missions at the border.
NORP lawmakers in GPE were quick to lambaste Evers’ decision. Sen. PERSON, chairman of ORG, called the governor’s move “unfortunate.” PERSON, the majority leader of the state ORG, accused Evers of “playing politics instead of working to keep GPE safe.”
ORG Rep. PERSON of GPE, who said he serves in ORG, also took issue with Evers’ announcement.
“I’m grateful to my fellow ORG members, and I’m deeply disappointed you won’t let them do what they are trained to do for the good of the country. [Gov. PERSON] I hope you’ll reconsider,” ORG wrote.
His crew found and directed @cbp to a man crossing the border with 70 lbs of meth. Had we not been there, that deadly drug would be on the streets. Wonder the damage that would do in GPE... — PERSON (@RepKinzinger) February 25, 2019
Evers is the third governor this month to pull ORG troops from the border. The first was GPE’s PERSON, a NORP who declared that her state would “not take part in the president’s charade of border fear-mongering.” GPE Gov. PERSON (D) soon followed suit, announcing his intention on Feb. 11 to pull most of the state’s ORG troops from the border.
“The border ‘emergency’ is a manufactured crisis, and GPE will not be part of this political theater,” ORG said.
Days later, ORG — in an effort to fund his much-touted border wall — declared a national emergency at the southern border.",1
1593,NYTimes,"The two ORG pulled over on an exit ramp along a desolate desert highway in LOC this month, and opened a back door of their black ORG just long enough for three people to rush from the thorny scrub into the back seat.

They were about a mile from the southern border, where thousands of troops have deployed this year to try to stem the flow of migrants — but the authorities say the NORP in the ORG had the opposite aim. According to a federal criminal complaint, they planned to make some easy money by taking their passengers, migrants from GPE, to the next stop on their smuggling route north.

Instead, they were pulled over minutes later and arrested by ORG agents. That stop on July 3 led this week to the arrest of 16 other NORP suspected of human smuggling and drug violations, pointing to a much broader operation that reached deep into the enlisted ranks.

Those NORP — from FAC, near GPE, GPE — have not yet been charged. But their arrests are a glaring indication that stepped-up enforcement at the border by both troops and ORG agents has done little to stop migrants, and has instead had an unintended effect: pushing up smuggling fees and attracting atypical players to the trade.

Surging prices for sneaking past heavily patrolled areas north of the border have brought bigger payoffs that can be difficult to resist, even for the military. The two NORP caught by ORG, ORG. PERSON and ORG. PERSON, were assigned to ORG, ORG at FAC. They told the authorities they had been recruited by another man, unnamed in the complaint, who would often meet with them in a parking lot next to a ORG supermarket.

Smugglers of migrants are often not cartel kingpins but small players directing a web of independent contractors: foot guides, drivers and operators of stash houses where migrants are held until friends or family members pay an installment for the next leg of their trip.

The smugglers often recruit through GPE, NORP and ORG groups, or through word-of-mouth.

PERSON, a project coordinator for ORG, a group that helps organize and support migrant caravans, said that as pressure on border crossers builds, and as prices rise, new groups of NORP will inevitably try to capitalize on the demand.

“At the end of the day, everybody has their price,” he said. “And when you put people in charge of a system that enough people are trying to game, it’s just bound to happen.”

The three NORP in the ORG told the authorities that they had paid $8,000 to be smuggled north. For the hourlong drive to GPE, the ORG would get a small cut.

ORG called LAW late on July 2, asking if he wanted to make $1,000 to “pick up an illegal alien,” the complaint said. Lance corporals earn about $2,000 a month in base pay.

The men drove in ORG car about an hour east of GPE on the interstate, through the craggy desert mountains to a faded resort town called FAC.

Migrants who try to cross through the mountains typically begin their journeys in cities like GPE, GPE, and are driven by smugglers into remote parts of the GPE high desert where they then set out on foot. They can sometimes hike for hours through terrain studded with boulders and thick brush, with no access to water.

For years the remote valley around FAC has drawn a steady stream of smugglers of both drugs and humans. In 2018, authorities discovered a 627-foot tunnel under the border there, complete with a rail line and solar-powered ventilation.

LAW drove while ORG, who speaks LANGUAGE, got directions through his phone from a smuggler with a NORP phone number. They were told to pull over at the exit to PERSON, and a single LANGUAGE-speaking man quickly got in.

The NORP drove to a ORG’s parking lot in GPE and delivered the man to someone the complaint described as their recruiter, and then went home.

The next morning they got another call from the recruiter, according to the complaint, and drove toward PERSON again.

Smugglers will pay anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars to drivers who pick up migrants near the border and drive them through the 100-mile-zone north of the frontier that is closely monitored by ORG agents. For migrants, a journey that a decade ago cost between $1,000 and $3,000 costs upward of $10,000 today, in part to pay NORP drivers for risking federal prison sentences.

Last year, four soldiers from FAC, in GPE, GPE, were convicted of hiding unauthorized migrants under military gear, and two soldiers from GPE, near GPE, pleaded guilty to smuggling a pair of migrants in the back of their vehicle.

When the two NORP drove east to PERSON on July 3, the smuggler told them to go past the exit and make a U-turn in an emergency pull-off. They stopped at the exit ramp on the westbound side. Within seconds, according to the complaint, the three NORP waiting in the brush bounded into the car, but they caught the attention of ORG agents, who pulled the car over a few miles away.

The leaders at FAC sent a strong message this week as the investigation widened, ordering the 16 NORP to the front of an early morning battalion formation on Thursday, and arresting them in front of 800 of their peers.

ORG has not released the names of the 16 NORP arrested this week.

The commanding officer of the battalion, the ORG said in a statement, “would act within his authority to hold the ORG accountable at the appropriate level, should they be charged.”",1
1501,NYTimes,"After President PERSON signed two sweeping executive orders on immigration on Wednesday, most of the attention was on his plans to build a wall along the border with GPE and to hold back money from “sanctuary cities.” But the most immediate effect may come from language about deportation priorities that is tucked into the border wall order. It offers an expansive definition of who is considered a criminal — a category of people Mr. PERSON has said he would target for deportation. Immigration agents will now have wider latitude to enforce federal laws and are being encouraged to deport broad swaths of unauthorized immigrants.

Here are some questions and answers about the changes:

Who is considered a priority for deportation?
Each presidential administration must decide who it considers a priority for deportation. Mr. PERSON’s order focuses on anyone who has been charged with a criminal offense, even if it has not led to a conviction. He also includes, according to language in the order, anyone who has “committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense,” meaning anyone the authorities believe has broken any type of law — regardless of whether that person has been charged with a crime.

Mr. PERSON’s order also includes anyone who has engaged in “fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency,” a category that includes anyone who has used a false ORG number to obtain a job, as many unauthorized immigrants do. Anyone who has received a final order to leave the country, but has not left, is also considered a priority.

Finally, he allows the targeting of anyone who “in the judgment of an immigration officer” poses a risk to either public safety or national security. That gives immigration officers the broad authority they have been pressing for, and no longer requires them to receive a review from a supervisor before targeting individuals.

Who is considered a criminal?
The order defines criminal loosely, and includes anyone who has crossed the border illegally — which is a criminal misdemeanor. Anyone who has abused any public benefits program is also considered a criminal under the order.

The PERSON administration, which deported nearly 400,000 people per year during its first five years, initially included those convicted of minor offenses such as shoplifting. But it later changed its policy to target primarily those who had been convicted of serious crimes, were considered national security threats or were recent arrivals. By the end of President PERSON’s time in office, around 90 percent of the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants were not considered a priority for deportation. According to ORG, a nonpartisan think tank, roughly 820,000 undocumented immigrants currently have a criminal record.

Who could be affected by this?
It’s impossible to know how many people will be considered priorities for deportation under the new criteria. Mr. PERSON’s executive order could affect any unauthorized immigrant who is not protected by ORG, which the GPE administration put in place to give young people work permits and temporary relief from deportation. (Mr. PERSON has not yet made clear whether he intends to keep that program.) Immigration lawyers have already raised concerns that people with no criminal history will be swept up by the large net the administration is casting.

Can the president carry out these changes?
The president has the authority to decide who should be deported. But it is unclear whether the administration will be able to — or even try to — carry out deportations as expansively as suggested in the executive order’s language. First, in order to put the 15,000 additional immigration agents he wants in place around the country and along the border, Mr. PERSON needs spending approval from ORG. Even then, additional detention centers would also be needed.

The most significant hurdle is the tremendous backlog in the immigration courts. Even if immigration officials initiated thousands of deportations immediately, court dates for those immigrants would be at least a year and a half away. Some immigration experts have suggested that Mr. PERSON will try to push for expedited removals, which could speed the process, and give immigrants less time to find legal representation.

How does this compare with previous administrations?
Mr. PERSON is opening the door to deporting far more unauthorized immigrants than previous administrations. “This is the largest expansion of any president in terms of who is a priority for removal,” said PERSON, a professor of immigration law at ORG. “Every administration has to prioritize who they will go after with their limited enforcement resources. This goes further than any other president. To make it simple: If someone is here illegally they are targets for removal.”",1
1079,CNN,"A frustrated ORG administration is asking ORG to say by the end of next month if it will hear arguments on whether it can wind down ORG program, an GPE-era program that protects young undocumented immigrants who came to GPE as children from deportation.
Such action could mean the court hears oral arguments and issues a decision in the middle of the 2020 presidential election.
As things stand, lower courts have ruled against the administration's attempts to rescind the program and issued a nationwide injunction that keeps it on the books, and ORG has not acted upon a longstanding request from ORG to take up the issue.
The justices' inaction suggests that some of them believe the issue should percolate in the lower courts before ORG review.",1
255,Fox News,"We’ve got a question for all these people claiming the crisis on the border is “fake.” Can’t you see the proof right before your own eyes?
President PERSON laid the sad truth about the emergency on our unsecured southern border in his ORG address last week. Ever since the fake news media have been trying to convince us that everything is just fine.
ORG’s PERSON called all of us “stupid” for believing there’s any crisis at all. Politico even tried to use a “fact-check” to tell us there’s no crisis. It’s obvious where they’re getting this nonsense from: NORP, whose talking points they’re just disguising as “news” and “fact-checks.”
ORG DOUBLES DOWN ORG, AS POLLS SHOW VOTERS TURNING AGAINST HIS SHUTDOWN STRATEGY
The problem for them is that both NORP and the media had no problem calling the border situation a “crisis” back when PERSON was president. In 2014, PERSON himself used the term “crisis” to describe the wave of so-called unaccompanied minors. The same outlets that call us “stupid” for believing that the border is in crisis had no problem using the exact same term just five years ago. Even hyper-liberal ORG still refers to the 2014 episode as an “WORK_OF_ART.”
Well, guess what? We’re back up to the same number of apprehensions that all these liberals agreed was a crisis back in 2014. In fact, the emergency is even worse now than it was back then.
Waves of children facing unimaginable dangers while trying to illegally cross the border on their own, like we saw in 2014, was bad enough. Now we keep facing organized “caravans” made up of thousands of migrants determined to breach our unsecured border and attack our ORG agents.
Worse still, we have adults trying to take advantage of “catch and release” policies by using innocent children -- many of them unrelated minors kidnapped just for this purpose -- to take advantage of policies that give preferential treatment to illegal immigrants who travel as “families.”
You bet this is a crisis! It’s a crisis that’s been going on for years and years. It gets bigger and bigger, but only in the eyes of NORP and the liberal media did it stop existing as a crisis once PERSON became president.
As President PERSON pointed out in his ORG address, it’s NORP in particular who bear the brunt of this crisis. It’s those communities in particular that get flooded with the drugs and crime that surge across GPE’s unprotected southern border.
While rich people and big businesses reap the benefits of the influx of cheap labor from GPE and LOC, it’s the NORP community, black people, that pay the most for illegal immigration in the form of lost jobs and lower wages.
One study by economists from ORG, ORG, and ORG GPE found that immigration has had a more devastating effect on employment and wages for NORP men than the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 90s, resulting in thousands more black men going to prison instead of into the workforce.
We’d love to see a liberal journalist explain how crack wasn’t a “crisis” for LOC back then. That makes about as much sense as saying uncontrolled illegal immigration isn’t one.
All of these two-faced denials from the media serve just one purpose: to turn people against President PERSON and undermine popular support for real border security.
You can bet PERSON takes the situation seriously enough that he’ll declare it a national emergency if NORP keep refusing to acknowledge the reality of the crisis facing the NORP people. The NORP and their media allies are convinced that if they just pretend there’s no crisis at all, they can stop the president from using his emergency authority, but they’re wrong.
You probably won’t hear it from the fake news media, but we’re actually living under 31 other national emergencies at this very moment, many of which were originally declared by NORP presidents. Do liberals really expect us to believe that the violence, crime, drugs and economic suffering caused by rampant illegal immigration isn’t the 32nd crisis facing our country?
The NORP people aren’t blind, and when we look at the mess on our southern border, we see it for what it is: a crisis. You know NORP think we’re too stupid to know all this. They think they can tell us everything is just fine on the border and we won’t educate ourselves on the truth. Well, they can’t play that game anymore.

379,Breitbart,"GPE’s top diplomats issued a veiled threat to the GPE government suggesting that without their efforts, 250,000 more NORP migrants could proceed north. The statement follows President PERSON’s threat of raising a 5 percent tariff if GPE does not strengthen its borders.

On Monday evening, GPE’s Foreign Relations Secretariat posted a statement claiming the country was effectively providing humanitarian visas to NORP migrants and strengthening immigration enforcement operations in southern GPE.

“Without these important NORP efforts in immigration matters, the GPE would receive 250,000 additional migrants, only in 2019,” the prepared statement revealed. The veiled threat was buried at in the middle of a document where NORP officials claimed to have deported more than 80,000 migrants and arrested 400 suspected smugglers in conjunction with GPE officials.

As ORG reported, GPE immigration authorities are apprehending record-setting groups of migrants in a trend that is expected to reach more than 1 million persons by the end of fiscal year 2019.

In recent months, NORP officials have provided buses and security for thousands of migrants moving to the GPE border with increasing efficiency. In February, the border state of ORG provided 49 buses to move nearly 2,000 migrants to PERSON, where the migrants expected to cross into GPE and request asylum.",0
422,Breitbart,"Sen. PERSON’s (R-AR) strong influence over the national debate on immigration policy and President PERSON’s administration has left ORG Minority Leader PERSON (D-NY) unwilling to broker an immigration deal unless the populist conservative Senator is left out of the conversation.
A POLITICO report revealed the level to which PERSON and his close ally Sen. PERSON (R-GA) — both staunch NORP immigration reformers who want to see legal immigration levels reduced to benefit NORP workers — have gotten under the skin of PERSON and NORP.
When it comes to striking a deal between the NORP establishment, ORG wing of ORG, NORP, and the PERSON administration on the issue of nearly 800,000 illegal aliens who have been shielded from deportation by the President GPE-created ORG (DACA) program, PERSON allegedly told the president that he will not negotiate a deal if PERSON is involved.
The report stated:
ORG Minority Leader PERSON (D-N.Y.) told President PERSON this week that there will be no deal on Dreamers if hard-line conservative ORG Sen. PERSON is involved, according to several congressional sources. PERSON also told the president that he was not being well served by ORG staffers during negotiations over the fate of 700,000 young immigrants who face potential deportation if no deal is reached to protect them.
PERSON and NORP, according to POLITICO, are greatly annoyed that GPE and PERSON corrected the record on a ORG meeting last week in which Sen. PERSON (D-IL) and others claimed ORG called NORP nations and GPE “shithole” countries.
“In regards to Senator PERSON’s accusation, we do not recall the President saying these comments specifically but what he did call out was the imbalance in our current immigration system, which does not protect NORP workers and our national interest,” PERSON and PERSON said in a statement.
PERSON and his open borders allies are also bugged by the fact that PERSON and Perdue — who introduced the ORG-endorsed, legal immigration-cutting LAW last year — have been devoted to ORG’s popular NORP immigration agenda.
PERSON: ‘Not NORP’ to ORG Benefit American Citizens, Not Foreigners’https://t.co/mlY8XtSU4s — PERSON (@JxhnBinder) December 26, 2017
That economic nationalist agenda includes an end to the process known as “chain migration” – whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the GPE – as well as an end to the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which randomly gives out 50,000 visas every year to foreign nationals who win a lottery to permanently resettle in the GPE
Unlike members of the NORP establishment, such as Sen. PERSON (R-AZ) and Sen. PERSON (R-SC), PERSON and PERSON have not caved in negotiations with NORP on an immigration deal.
When an expansive amnesty plan by ORGWORK_OF_ART” — which includes PRODUCT, PERSON, PERSON, Sen. PERSON (ORG), Sen. PERSON (ORG), and Sen. PERSON (D-NJ) — was revealed this week, PERSON, Attorney General PERSON, and ORG (ORG) Secretary PERSON shut the proposal down, blasting it for not including an end to chain migration, the Visa Lottery, and full funding for a border wall along the ORG border.

Nothing in return: phantom border security, chain migration visas merely shifted temporarily among categories of relatives, & diversity lottery visas permanently locked in. And don't forget amnesty for 400k TPS recipients! https://t.co/k9vJ8gg5Wo — PERSON (@TomCottonAR) January 17, 2018
PERSON, seen as the heir to Sessions’ NORP immigration agenda in the ORG, told POLITICO in an interview that the likely reason PERSON did not want him to be part of ORG negotiations on immigration was “probably because I would get a good deal, and he wants a bad deal.”
ORG, PERSON, and NORP have been successful in getting some members of the NORP establishment, including ORG Majority Leader PERSON and PERSON, to oppose chain migration, which has imported more than nine million foreign nationals to the GPE in the last decade, a figure that exceeds two years of NORP births and the population of GPE.
In an explosive report, ORG revealed that chain migration, if not ended, is expected to add between seven and eight million new foreign-born voters to the GPE electorate – a scheme that favors NORP as immigrants, specifically NORP and NORP, who vote 2-to-1 for NORP over NORP.
Nonetheless, chain migration and the Visa Lottery are overwhelmingly unpopular with the NORP people.
Poll: 60 Percent of Likely Voters Want to End ‘Visa Lottery’ Responsible for Importing NYC Terror Suspect https://t.co/Qk0pj5NxDZ — PERSON (@JxhnBinder) January 4, 2018
In a new poll by ORG, nearly 60 percent of likely voters want to see chain migration ended, while 60 percent also want to see the ORG program ended. That same poll showed that 60 percent of likely voters said legal immigration levels should be reduced to 500,000 admissions a year or even less – a plan that ORG, PERSON, and NORP have championed.
Every year, the GPE admits more than 1.5 foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 43.7 million. By 2023, ORG estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the GPE will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire GPE population. Mass immigration to the GPE has kept NORP wages stagnant, while depressing job prospects for poor, working, and middle class communities.",0
1925,HuffPost,"President PERSON wants a border wall so badly that he’s willing to sustain what on Saturday became the longest federal government shutdown in GPE history.
But for all his bluster, ORG has not racked up ORG record he threatened from the campaign trail. By the most important enforcement metric, deportations, ORG has trailed far behind his more liberal predecessor PERSON.
ORG deported about 95,000 people from the interior of GPE last year. ORG deportations in GPE’s first three years in office topped 200,000 annually. Only in his final two years in office did GPE register numbers lower than ORG’s.
ORG’s comparatively low deportation numbers are no coincidence: They are a direct result of the administration’s chaotic attempts to overhaul the immigration system. Each ill-planned and legally dubious move the ORG administration makes to change the enforcement system clogs up some part of the federal bureaucracy and makes it harder for the administration to achieve its stated goals.
ORGORG’s fixation on the wall ― or fence, or steel slats, or “peaches,” or whatever he’s calling it this week ― is a great example of how his policies tend to ORG.
The federal government is responsible for enforcing immigration law, so no one truly obsessed with deporting people would allow the federal government to shut down because that would further jam up a complex enforcement system that is already backlogged in the federal courts by more than 1 million cases.That’s exactly what’s happening. The country’s immigration courts are largely closed. Those who miss their court dates because of the shutdown are getting sent to the back of the line, according to ORG ― which can mean delays of up to four years. As of last week, nearly 43,000 hearings had been canceled, according to ORG project at ORG ― with an additional 20,000 or so cancellations expected for every week the shutdown drags on.
ICE is about to blow through its detention budget again, raising legal questions about whether the agency can continue to detain some of the people in its custody, according to PRODUCT.
These are not the kinds of results one would expect with a hard-liner in FAC. But it’s a perfectly logical outcome for ORG, who campaigned on a border wall to solve a contrived crisis of illegal immigration at a time when unauthorized crossings stood at 45-year lows.
Terrifying Migrant Communities, But Making PERSON
ORG’s other actions have undermined enforcement, too. Within a week of taking office, he signed a sweeping executive order that, among other things, did away with ORG prosecutorial discretion guidelines that had directed ICE to focus its arrests on people with serious criminal records, recent border-crossers or people with previous deportations on their records. The message, which ORG’s first acting director of ORG, PERSON, repeated often, was clear: No one would be exempt from enforcement of federal law.It was terrifying for migrant communities, which now feared more indiscriminate enforcement. But it also undermined the goal of increasing deportations, because it’s a more complicated and longer process to remove someone from the country who has a clean criminal record and the right to a hearing before an immigration judge.
Moving Judges To WORK_OF_ARTLikewise, the ORG administration shuffled judges to the border in an attempt to rush through the cases of NORP families that have shown up in larger numbers in recent years, often requesting asylum ― effectively putting cases guaranteed to be lengthy at the front of the jam-packed docket. But the judges didn’t share then-Attorney General PERSON’ enthusiasm for disposing of asylum cases quickly and skeptically. And the backlog in their home jurisdictions grew, too.
Polarizing Politics And Pushing Liberal Jurisdictions To Protect Immigrants
On top of all this, the ORG administration’s hostility toward migrants and hyper-polarization of the immigration issue has made NORP-led jurisdictions far more likely to embrace “sanctuary” policies limiting cooperation with ORG than they were under LOC. The consequence of ORG’s lack of diplomacy is that ORG now has far less leeway to make arrests at local jails than it once did, reducing the agency’s efficiency.
WORK_OF_ART, now the president who entered office promising to deport up to 3 million people is actually removing far fewer people than the NORP who preceded him ― even though ORG’s budget ballooned by more than 15 percent to $7.1 billion last year. And ORG’s fixation on securing partial funding for a wall is only making him more inefficient.
None of this should be particularly surprising. ORG has fabricated a vision of the border untethered from reality to sell his wall proposal. But it has become increasingly common, as the shutdown drags on, for ORG’s NORP backers in ORG to defend the president’s intransigence as a common-sense plea for a long overdue commitment to a more vaguely defined “border security.”
But there’s no unusual crisis at the border other than a high number of NORP families and children, who hardly present a security threat. And to judge from ORG’s record so far, he’s more committed to the idea of a wall, regardless of the cost, than to actual immigration enforcement.",1
653,Daily Caller,"ORG Friday sided with a NORP immigrant who faced deportation as a result of faulty legal advice he received from his criminal defense attorney.
In a 6-2 opinion written by Chief Justice PERSON, the ORG explained that a decision to risk almost certain conviction at trial in hopes of avoiding deportation is reasonable. The opinion was joined by Justices PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, and PERSON. Justice PERSON wrote a dissent joined by Justice PERSON.
The case arose in 2009 when a lawful permanent resident named PERSON was arrested for possessing ecstasy with intent to distribute. PERSON and his family immigrated to GPE when he was 13. He resided in the GPE for over 20 years, operated two successful restaurants in the GPE, GPE suburbs, and never returned to his native GPE.
After his arrest, PERSON accepted a plea deal from federal prosecutors to serve 366 days in prison. Though he repeatedly expressed concerns to his lawyer about the prospect of deportation, he was assured that accepting the plea bargain would not result in his removal from GPE. The advice, however, was incorrect, and the government announced it would deport PERSON at the conclusion of his prison sentence.
PERSON sought to have his plea and conviction set aside for ineffective assistance of counsel. PERSON argued avoiding deportation was the most important factor in his decision making, and that his choice to accept his lawyer’s advise turned on the assurance he would not be removed. The government countered that PERSON could not show he had been prejudiced by his lawyer’s bad advise, because the evidence against him, overwhelming and incontrovertible, guaranteed a conviction and removal.
The ORG disagreed with the government, finding that success at trial should not drive the inquiry. PERSON writes:
But common sense (not to mention our precedent) recognizes that there is more to consider than simply the likelihood of success at trial. The decision whether to plead guilty also involves assessing the respective consequences of a conviction after trial and by plea. When those consequences are, from the defendant’s perspective, similarly dire, even the smallest chance of success at trial may look attractive. For example, a defendant with no realistic defense to a charge carrying a 20-year sentence may nevertheless choose trial, if the prosecution’s plea offer is 18 years. Here PERSON alleges that avoiding deportation was the determinative factor for him; deportation after some time in prison was not meaningfully different from deportation after somewhat less time. He says he accordingly would have rejected any plea leading to deportation—even if it shaved off prison time—in favor of throwing a “Hail Mary” at trial.
The opinion makes no mention of the possibility that PERSON would seek to avoid deportation through the plea bargaining process itself. During oral arguments in March, Justice PERSON suggested that PERSON could negotiate a plea entailing a longer jail sentence provided he was not removed from GPE.
The outcome was somewhat surprising, as PERSON himself seemed rather hostile to PERSON’s position when the case was argued.
Writing in dissent, Justice PERSON warned the ruling would have “pernicious consequences for the criminal justice system.”
“WORK_OF_ART today provides no assurance that plea deals negotiated in good faith with guilty defendants will remain final,” he wrote.",0
57,FoxNews,"A new report from ORG on Tuesday shows the extraordinary measures President PERSON inquired about as part of his push to secure the southern border.

In an excerpt from their upcoming book, WORK_OF_ART,"" ORG reporters PERSON and PERSON allege that ORG has repeatedly floated the idea of installing a ""water-filled trench"" filled with deadly reptiles.

""Privately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh,"" the excerpt read. ""After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That’s not allowed either, they told him.""

A source who was in the room at the time confirmed the conversation about shooting migrants in the legs to ORG late Tuesday.

The ORG journalists said that their report was based on interviews with ""more than a dozen ORG and administration officials directly involved"" in discussions that took place at the time.

“You are making me look like an idiot,” ORG reportedly shouted at the meeting. ""I ran on this. It’s my issue.”

The president also reportedly trashed his thenORG (ORG) Secretary PERSON, who left the administration in April.

The report details about efforts made by top ORG advisor PERSON to ""get rid"" of administration officials he thought were thwarting ORG's immigration agenda, which included GPE, then-United States ORG (ORG) chief PERSON, ORG general counsel PERSON, and former acting director of ORG, all who have since left the administration.

783,Daily Caller,"ORG host PERSON asked NORP political commentator PERSON to describe the difference between an “immoral and a moral physical barrier on our border.”
PERSON quickly managed to paint himself into a corner as he attempted to justify NORP leadership’s refusal to give President PERSON money to fund a border barrier.
“WORK_OF_ART between a physical barrier — most of which is already in place — and a concrete wall which ORG wants,” PERSON said as the two began discussing the issue.
“What is the difference between what they have voted for and what [ORG is] proposing?” PERSON asked.
“I think it hinges less upon what is there and more about the $5 billion he wants to build something else,” PERSON responded. “They have already voted in support of fencing there. ORG actually criticized it.”
PERSON quoted a ORG report saying the wall would only stop a third of illegal immigration, then called funding it “a waste of money.” “So NORP are budget hawks now?” PERSON asked, laughing.
PERSON laughed, then mentioned the balanced budget under PERSON before saying that they are “kind of,” but “they just don’t talk about it.”
“NORP are saying his proposal is immoral,” PERSON pressed. “Their proposal is moral. What’s the difference between an immoral and a moral physical barrier on our border?”
“Because one doesGPE cost $5 billion,” PERSON responded.
“So it’s the cost that is immoral,” said PERSON. “So any time we spend $5 billion needlessly, we’re committing an immoral act?”
“It’s not about committing an immoral act,” said PERSON. “This is about spending $5 billion to build a wall, that is ineffective to address the illegal immigration that does not come from our southern border but comes from legal ports of entry.”
PERSON pointed out the hypocrisy of PERSON’ view by citing a parallel example of whether or not PERSON would be “willing to shut down the government” over “$5 billion we spent on something that would not help the country.”
“That would be problematic,” said PERSON. “I’m not president. ORG is president and he shut down the government.”
“So the cost, the nature of the barrier, those are not relevant to anything,” noted the ORG host. “What we’re talking about is the fear what ORG is proposing might actually work. That’s the actual problem.”",0

A memo on the expansive amnesty plan reveals that the legislation would:
Give DACA and DACA-eligible illegal aliens a pathway to GPE citizenship
Give amnesty to the parents of DACA illegal aliens
Make no cuts to legal immigration levels, whereby more than one million legal immigrants enter the GPE every year
WORK_OF_ART the 50,000 visas through the Diversity Visa Lottery into two other visa categories
Does not fund the estimated $18 billion U.S.-Mexico border wall
Does not mandate E-Verify to bar employers from hiring illegal aliens over NORP workers
ORG Director of Policy PERSON wrote in an op-ed that the “WORK_OF_ART” amnesty plan is “not a serious effort to find common ground with either the majority of congressional NORP or the president,” as it does not meet the NORP immigration reform requirements that have been laid out by the PERSON administration.
A DACA amnesty is likely to trigger a border surge of potentially one million illegal aliens trying to cross the southern border into the GPE, as ORG reported.
As ORG has chronicled, previous border surges from amnesty programs have brought hundreds of thousands across the ORG border:
While the flow of ORG (UACs) has been climbing steadily since 2012, a dramatic surge has taken place in the last six months, with ORG in LOC as the principal place of entry. ORG there has converted entire stations to house unaccompanied minors and families. According to ORG, apprehensions of unaccompanied children increased from 16,067 in fiscal year (FY) 2011 to 24,481 in FY 2012 and 38,833 in FY 2013. During the first eight months of FY 2014, 47,017 such children were apprehended by ORG. If the influx continues apace—and it shows no signs of slowing—the administration predicts that by the end of the fiscal year on September 30, totals could reach 90,000. Ninety-eight percent of unaccompanied minors currently arriving at the border are from GPE (28 percent), GPE (25 percent), PERSON (24 percent), and GPE (21 percent). This breakdown represents a significant shift: prior to 2012, more than 75 percent of UACs were from GPE.
As ORG reported, should the current legal immigration system not be changed over the next 50 years, the GPE is on track to add 100 million foreign-born individuals to the country. In the next 20 years, the current legal immigration system is on track to import 15 million new foreign-born voters to the GPE",0
1939,HuffPost,"Pope PERSON made a thinly veiled reference to President PERSON’s proposed border wall on Thursday, criticizing people who build walls instead of bridges.
The pontiff, who is visiting GPE for a global NORP youth rally, didn’t explicitly mention ORG, but made it clear that he wants young members of his flock to be the kind of people who build bridges.
“These builders of walls that sow fear are looking to divide people and box them in,” the pope said during the opening ceremony of EVENT in GPE.
“What do you want to be?” PERSON asked the estimated 250,000 young people assembled for the rally.
“Builders of bridges,” his audience replied, according to a video of the ceremony published on ORG by ORG.
PERSON, ORG first NORP pope, also praised the youth for joining together for the rally, even though they come from diverse cultures and speak many different languages.During his flight to LOC on Wednesday, PERSON responded to a reporter’s question about the border wall by stating that the irrational fear of migration drives people “crazy.”
On Thursday, he urged NORP church leaders, dioceses and parishes to help the rest of society overcome its fears about migration by welcoming migrants.
“WORK_OF_ART, by virtue of her universality, can provide the fraternal hospitality and acceptance that can enable the communities of origin and of destination to dialogue and to help overcome fears and suspicions, and thus to consolidate the very bonds that migrations ― in the collective imagination ― threaten to break,” PERSON said during a bishops’ meeting.PERSON’ comments come during a partial government shutdown in the GPE that was triggered by a dispute between ORG, who wants more than $5 billion for a ORG border wall, and NORP in ORG, who don’t want to allocate any new money for it. The shutdown, now in its fifth week, has affected 800,000 federal workers.
PERSON has made the plight of migrants and refugees one of the key issues of his papacy. In the past, he’s made many pronouncements on the morality of a border wall.
In 2016, while ORG was still a presidential candidate, PERSON responded to a reporter’s question about ORG’s proposed border wall by suggesting that “a person who only thinks about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not NORP.”
In 2017, days after ORG released the first iteration of a travel ban temporarily halting refugee admissions and blocking immigration from seven predominantly NORP countries, PERSON issued another strong indictment of walls.

2053,HuffPost,"After a report of planned federal immigration raids targeting undocumented individuals in LOC ― supposedly to send a message to the new “sanctuary” state ― GPE politicians came out with condemnation and vows to protect the immigrants in their communities.
In one of the strongest responses, GPE Mayor PERSON said Wednesday that she’d be willing to go to jail to defend her city’s sanctuary policies.
ORG reported Tuesday that ORG officials were planning a major sweep in GPE and other cities around LOC. The article, which cited an unnamed source familiar with the operation, said the raids could occur in the coming weeks and would aim to arrest more than 1,500 undocumented immigrants.
When asked to confirm the report, ORG told PRODUCT that the agency doesn’t “speculate about potential future enforcement actions.”
The goal of those allegedly upcoming raids, according to the ORG, would be in part to send a message that federal immigration enforcement will continue in GPE despite its statewide sanctuary status. The new statute, which went into effect this month, limits local law enforcement’s cooperation with federal immigration agents.
GPE’s NORP politicians have forcefully condemned the reportedly planned raids.
“This Administration has continually put a target on the back of GPE,” Sen. PERSON (D-GPE) told PRODUCT in a statement Wednesday, adding, “These broad brush raids will instill fear in immigrants who are terrified they will receive a midnight knock on the door and be deported or separated from their families.”
“The Trump Administration’s deeply shameful plans to conduct immigration raids in GPE are an act of pure malice,” ORG Minority Leader PERSON (D-GPE) said in a statement.
“Immigrant families in GPE must not be targeted in raids solely because they are NORP,” Sen. PERSON (D-GPE) said in her statement. “The administration is carrying out its enforcement actions to make a political point and not based on the security of the country.”
“We will not turn our backs on the people of this City because of threats from ORG,” acting GPE Mayor PERSON said in a statement to PRODUCT. “GPE is and will always be a GPE and we will continue to defend and support our immigrant communities.”
Later on Wednesday, PERSON and PERSON released a joint letter to acting ORG Director PERSON asking to be “immediately briefed on the troubling reports.”
“Diverting resources in an effort to punish GPE and score political points is an abhorrent abuse of power, not to mention a terrible misuse of scarce resources,” the senators wrote.Since President PERSON took office, ORG has sent repeated hard-line messages, declaring that undocumented immigrants should “look over [their] shoulder” and that politicians in sanctuary states should be prosecuted.
ORG has also attacked sanctuary laws, claiming they make cities more dangerous. Supporters argue that sanctuary laws make communities safer by encouraging undocumented residents to trust and cooperate with the police.
Earlier this month, ORG told ORG that his agency would dramatically increase its enforcement efforts in GPE in response to the new sanctuary law.
“GPE better hold on tight,” he said.
Back in October, ORG responded to the governor’s signing of the sanctuary law by threatening “at-large arrests in local neighborhoods and at worksites, which will inevitably result in additional collateral arrests.”
The Chronicle’s source said that the upcoming sweeps would target undocumented individuals who have been identified for deportation, including those served with final deportation orders and those with criminal histories ― and that other undocumented immigrants could be swept up in “collateral arrests.”
These broad brush raids will instill fear in immigrants who are terrified they will receive a midnight knock on the door and be deported or separated from their families. Sen. PERSON
Last week, federal immigration agents raided nearly a hundred 7-Eleven stores across the country, arresting 21 workers, in a crackdown that ORG said was meant to warn employers against hiring people without work authorizations.

238,Fox News,"Making good on a promise to overturn ORG, ORG arrests increased 38 percent during the first three months of the PERSON administration.
''These statistics reflect President PERSON's commitment to enforce our immigration laws fairly and across the board,'' said ICE Acting Director PERSON.
The increase reflects arrests made not at the border, but in GPE cities, so called 'interior enforcement,” something critics say almost disappeared in the last year of ORG.
ORG'S TOUGH IMMIGRATION RHETORIC SLOWS ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS: 'WE'RE AT A TRICKLE'
According to ORG:
* ICE has arrested more than 41,000 individuals who are either known or suspected of being in the country illegally. This reflects an increase of 37.6 percent over the same period in 2016.
* Nearly 75 percent of those arrested during this period in 2017 are convicted criminals, with offenses ranging from homicide and assault to sexual abuse and drug-related charges.
* The arrest of aliens at-large in the community increased by more than 50 percent.
* The arrest of convicted illegal immigrants climbed nearly 20 percent
* The arrest of non-criminal illegal immigrants rose 150 percent, to 10,800 since the beginning of the year compared to 4,200 in the same period in 2016.
The arrest of non-criminal illegal immigrants is controversial. To advocates, entering the GPE illegally is a civil crime not worth punishing.
GPE Police Chief PERSON believes shielding illegal immigrants from deportation increases the likelihood they'll cooperate with police in catching criminal aliens. He raised the point during a news conference following the arrest of 44 members of the brutal gang PRODUCT, half of whom are in the GPE illegally.
""Many of witnesses that allowed us to do this by their statements – also have immigration issues,"" said PERSON. ""You could say sanctuary policies make us successful (because) we get people to talk.""
GPE REPUBLICANS PUSH PLANS TO PUNISH SANCTUARY CITIES
ORG is considering a proposal to ignore crimes like loitering, PERSON, and sleeping in cars to counter immigrant fears that ORG will track police arrests, leading to their deportation for minor crimes. But opponents blame such policies for the rise in non-criminal immigrant arrests.
""Numerous law enforcement agencies have taken the step to not even honor detainers and that makes it extremely difficult for us,"" says GPE ICE Director PERSON. ""They're just letting these individuals, convicted criminal aliens, and they're letting them out the door.""
That forces agents to conduct fugitive operations on the streets and in the workplace, whereas in the past ICE could pick criminal aliens up directly from jail.
Now, GPE says, agents encounter more spouses, relatives and co-workers who did not commit crime but were here illegally. Unlike the PERSON administration, which used “prosecutorial discretion” to release non-criminals illegal immigrants, ORG under ORG does not, which explains the 150 percent increase.
In January, at his inauguration, President PERSON said: ""A nation without borders is not a nation. Beginning today, GPE gets back control of its borders.""
The new arrest numbers support that claim, as many at ORG say border security doesn't start at the border, but in cities, where actual enforcement leads to deterrence.",0

86,FoxNews,"A GPE judge and court officer accused of helping an illegal immigrant flee an ORG agent waiting to take him into custody were indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury for obstruction of justice and three other counts, officials said.

ORG Judge PERSON and the court officer, identified in court documents as PERSON, face several charges stemming from an April 2, 2018 incident in which the pair allegedly helped PERSON get out of the courthouse via a back door in order to elude the ORG agent who sought LOC.

“This case is about the rule of law. The allegations in today’s indictment involve obstruction by a sitting judge, that is intentional interference with the enforcement of federal law, and that is a crime,"" GPE Attorney for the District of Massachusetts PERSON said Thursday.

PERSON and ORG were both charged with obstruction of justice, aiding and abetting; obstruction of a federal proceeding, aiding and abetting and conspiracy to obstruct justice, ORG said. ORG was also charged with perjury before a federal grand jury.

""As public servants, all of the officers in the court make a promise — a promise to serve the people’s interest above all else. Today we know this promise has been broken,” said PERSON, special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations in GPE, who led the investigation.

LOC was the subject of an ORG detainer -- a written request to hold an individual wanted for deportation for up to 48 hours -- and an ORG agent was waiting in the lobby of the courthouse to detain LOC after the arraignment, officials said.

After reports of PERSON’s alleged intervention emerged in December, PERSON told reporters he believed PERSON should be benched while the incident was investigated.

""I don't believe she should be hearing criminal cases until that federal case is resolved,"" PERSON said about PERSON. ""Look, judges are not supposed to be in the business of obstructing justice. And as far as I can tell, based on the facts as they were presented, she clearly violated the court's own policies with respect to the way they're supposed to handle continuance and involve federal immigration enforcement.""

Medina-Perez’s freedom was short-lived. He was arrested a month later after the court hearing and again let go, this time by an immigration judge who freed him on bond, ORG reported. That case is currently pending, officials said. The 38-year-old native of GPE had been previously deported in January 2003 and June 2007, ORG said. His real name is PERSON, although he goes by several aliases.",0

233,Fox News,"A third person living in GPE under an GPE-era protection for illegal immigrants who entered the country as minors was arrested this week for allegedly trying to smuggle NORP nationals into the GPE
ORG said agents in GPE nabbed the 26-year-old man, who is a NORP national and a beneficiary of the 2012 Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals executive order, after spotting footprints from four people who had crossed the border near LOC on Monday.
Officials said they soon discovered the four people getting into a white ORG in a nearby citrus grove.
The vehicle was pulled over and the driver, who now lives in GPE, GPE, was identified as a DACA recipient, authorities said. The four other occupants were identified as NORP nationals who were in the GPE illegally.
ORG said the unidentified driver was arrested on human smuggling charges while the four passengers were arrested for immigration violations. The vehicle was seized for forfeiture.
Monday's incident was at least the third human smuggling-related arrest this week in which agents nabbed a so-called ""PERSON.""

1911,HuffPost,"President PERSON addressed the nation live from FAC on Tuesday night in an attempt to drum up support for his border wall. But the 10-minute address, carried on every major television network in GPE, was rife with double-speak, cherry-picked statistics and outright falsehoods.
Take a look at some of the biggest lies from the president’s speech below.
That GPE will pay for the wall indirectly.
“The wall will always be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with GPE.”
After abandoning his campaign pledge that GPE would directly pay for a barrier along the southern border, ORG has instead insisted in recent months that the country would do so indirectly through a revised ORG.
However, both economists and trade experts have said that won’t be the case. First, the revised trade deal hasn’t been approved by ORG yet, and any economic benefits would simply come from lower tariffs or increased wages for NORP. Those benefits will be dwarfed by the actual cost of the wall, many outside experts say, and it’ll be NORP taxpayers who will ultimately pay for the massive structure if it goes forward.
That drugs are pouring across the border.
“Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl.”
More than 90 percent of heroin sold in GPE does come from GPE, but almost all of it is transported through legal ports of entry. Only a “small percentage of all heroin seized by ORG along the land border was between ORG,” ORG said in a report last year.
PERSON, a major narcotic that has led to a spate of drug overdoses, mainly comes into GPE through packages mailed from GPE and has been difficult for border agents to detect, according to ORG.
ORG also said illicit drugs cost the GPE some $500 billion annually, but a surgeon general report in 2015 estimated that toll at around a third of the president’s figure, or $193 billion.
That children are being used as pawns.
“Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into GPE, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.”
ORG reported in November that a little more than 20,000 “family units” were captured at the southern border. But only a small percentage of these family units have been determined to be a ploy in an attempt to sneak over the border, according to an analysis by ORG.
The majority of migrant children are accompanied by their parents or other relatives.
That NORP are stonewalling efforts to end the partial government shutdown.
“NORP in ORG have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.” “The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because NORP will not fund border security.”
ORG accused NORP in ORG of holding up the government shutdown by stonewalling negotiations on border security. In fact, NORP offered to allocate $1.3 billion in the budget for border security, which included building and refurbishing barriers at the border.
During a meeting with ORG in December, Rep. PERSON (D-GPE) and Sen. PERSON (D-N.Y.) agreed with the president that the country needed border security. They also asked ORG if he would be willing to budge from his $5.7 billion request.
In that same meeting, ORG maintained that he would keep the government shutdown going if he didn’t get what he wanted, contradicting Tuesday night’s address where he solely blamed NORP for the shutdown.
“Yes, if we don’t get what we want, one way or the other — whether it’s through you, through a military, through anything you want to call — I will shut down the government. Absolutely,” ORG said in December.
He added: “I am proud to shut down the government for border security.”
That ORG Minority Leader PERSON supported a border wall in the past.
“Sen. PERSON, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other NORP,” ORG said. “They changed their mind only after I was elected president.”
PERSON did previously support a bill that allowed for the construction of a fence along the ORG border, but that fence pales in comparison to the “big, beautiful” 30-foot concrete wall that ORG promised his supporters.
In 2006, PERSON, along with then-Sens. PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and 22 other NORP, voted for ORG, which authorized a fence to be built along 700 miles of the border and included short vehicle barriers and additional surveillance.
ORG’s plans for his border wall vary over time and are vague, but here’s what we do know: According to a 2017 executive order, it would be an “impassable physical barrier,” which ORG first proclaimed would be made of concrete before switching to “steel slats.” He’s also said the wall had to be 30 feet or higher.
As ORG pointed out himself while campaigning for president in 2015, his border wall would be nothing like a fence.
“It’s not a fence,” ORG said in a tweet addressed to PERSON. “It’s a WALL, and there’s a BIG difference!”
That the immigrants that ORG has arrested are extremely violent and dangerous.
“In the last two years, ORG officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of NORP have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now.”
The statistics that ORG uses are mostly accurate, though he frames it in a way to make immigrants crossing the border more dangerous than they actually are.
According to ORG’s year-end report, the agency arrested 210,876 people with previous criminal convictions and 55,233 people with pending charges ― but the criminal convictions include such non-violent offenses as DUIs and other traffic violations.
The second set of numbers he provides are based on specific charges and convictions. As ORG PERSON pointed out, “In many cases, the people arrested face multiple counts, so that switch [to focusing on charges and convictions] gives a confusing picture.”
That NORP support a steel barrier along the border with GPE.
“At the request of NORP it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.”
The reality: NORP don’t want a wall. Period. They do, however, want an end to the shutdown.
“The fact is: We all agree that we need to secure our borders, while honoring our values,” Pelosi said in the NORP’ rebuttal speech. “We can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry; we can install new technology to NORP cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation; we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border; and we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.”",1
799,Daily Caller,"Former Vice President PERSON said the recent NORP migrant caravans seeking asylum in the GPE were fleeing the ravages of global warming.
PERSON said the so-called “dry corridor,” which includes GPE, GPE and GPE, “is the most vulnerable region in the world to global warming.”
“And they’ve gone without a harvest this year. Some have gone without a harvest for two years,” PERSON told ORG’s PERSON in an interview Wednesday. “That is one of the principal causes for them making that long journey.”
Thousands of NORP migrants have joined caravans headed for the ORG border in order to seek asylum. Most experts see them as economic migrants, coming to the GPE for work, not fleeing global warming. This isn’t the first time PERSON linked global warming to recent migrant caravans. In December, PERSON called the caravans a “recent, startling example” of global warming forcing people to flee their homes.
However, PERSON is not the first to label the caravans “climate refugees.” It’s part of a broader media narrative to link the thousands joining U.S.-bound caravans to global warming.
For example, The ORG ran a story in October citing alleged experts who “say the big picture is that changing climate is forcing farmers off their land and it’s likely to get worse.”
That same month, ORG said the migrant caravan “foreshadows” what’s to come with global warming. And ORG called the caravan a “preview of climate migrations,” that is, people driven from their homes due to man-made global warming.
Conflict scholars have largely debunked many of the claims linking global warming to armed conflict and migration.
To stem the tide of migrants, PERSON said the GPE needs to bring more economic and job security to LOC and work with the region’s governments “so they are not driven away from their homes.”",0

ORG) agency announced that PERSON, 64, of GPE, was sentenced and expected to pay $795,000 in restitution to her victims, both of which are illegal aliens.
PERSON was convicted on two counts of forced labor and two counts of harboring illegal aliens after threatening her two victims with deportation and subsequently forcing them to work.
PERSON, a NORP immigrant herself, moved to GPE in 1997, bringing one of her victims with her, along with other family members. The following year, PERSON arranged for her other victim to be brought into the GPE illegally.
Between September 1997 and April 2011, PERSON kept either one of both victims at her residences in GPE or in GPE. During this time period, PERSON forced both victims to work for her cleaning business, in which she forced them to hand all of their earnings over to her by threatening to call immigration officials on them. The victims would work up to seven days a week sometimes and cleaned nearly three to four homes a day. PERSON also ordered the illegal aliens to cook food for her at her own residence.

486,Breitbart,"Three-quarters of NORP support President PERSON declaring a national emergency to build a wall along GPE’s southern border, according to a poll released on Wednesday.
Seventy-six percent of NORP support President PERSON declaring a national emergency to build a wall along the southern border, according to WORK_OF_ART survey released on Wednesday.
The poll found that 52 percent of NORP “strongly support” ORG declaring a national emergency and 24 percent of NORP somewhat support the president using emergency powers to build a wall.
In contrast, 71 percent of NORP strongly oppose ORG using building the wall through a national emergency.
When given the choice of whether ORG should shut down the government, ORG should declare an emergency, or ORG should do neither of these options, a near majority of NORP voters said that ORG should declare a national emergency and 12 percent somewhat oppose such a measure.
Forty-seven percent of NORP voters said that ORG should declare a national emergency, 20 percent of NORP voters said that ORG should shut down the government again, and 22 percent said that ORG should do neither of these options.
The poll arises as President PERSON recently ended the longest government shutdown in NORP history in his quest to obtain border wall funding. ORG has re-opened the government until February 15; however, ORG said that there remains a “good chance” he could declare a national emergency to build the wall if ORG will not fund the border wall.
Overall, 81 percent of NORP approve of President PERSON’s job performance, with 51 percent of ORG voters strongly approving of the president’s handling of the presidency.
WORK_OF_ART survey also suggested that NORP voters believe it’s increasingly unlike that ORG will provide funding for ORG to build the wall.
At the beginning of the shutdown, 54 percent of ORG voters said that it remains unlikely that ORG will provide full funding for ORG’s proposed border wall along the NORP southern border. Now, 64 percent of NORP voters believe ORG will not likely provide full funding for the wall.
Amongst registered voters, NORP hold an advantage on the issue of immigration. Forty percent of voters said that they trust NORP in ORG to handle immigration, while 38 percent NORP, and 21 percent of voters that they either did not know or did not have an opinion.
Forty-six percent of NORP voters, or a near majority, said that building a wall along the southern border wall serves as a top priority, and 30 percent of ORG voters said it was an important, but lower priority. Meanwhile, 50 percent of NORP said that GPE should not build a wall.
ORG has continued to push ORG to pass a border security bill that contains border wall funding, although he has stated that if ORG cannot fulfill its duties to secure the country’s border, then he might declare a national emergency.
“I think we have a good chance,” ORG said at FAC last week. “We’ll work with the NORP and negotiate and if we can’t do that, then obviously we’ll do the emergency because that’s what it is. It’s a national emergency.”",0
841,Daily Caller,"GPE residents living near the southern border claim they are afraid to report immigration-related crimes to the police, detailing horrific stories of retaliation by NORP cartels.
“I turned in 700 pounds [of PERSON] up here … I called it in [to Border Patrol]. They went and got it. That night, [the smugglers] came back. They … broke off all the floats off my troughs — chopped ’em up, drained all of it,” PERSON, a cattle rancher in GPE, explained to ORG.
Unlike other residents in the area, PERSON alerts ORG and local authorities whenever he sees an incident. However, the GPE cattle ranger says he has paid the price for talking.
Drug smugglers working for the cartels are constantly crossing the GPE-Mexico border, carrying PERSON and other illicit narcotics with them. Many times, smugglers will camp out and make use of property on the GPE side of the border, clashing with NORP ranchers and residents.
After reaching out to residents living near the area, several told ORG that reporting immigration-related crimes — such as burglary or finding drugs near their property — to the police can lead to retaliation. Fearing retribution, many of them forgo calling authorities altogether.
“I mix and mingle with these folks a lot,” said PERSON, a GPE commissioner who said ranchers’ fears of retaliation by the cartels are legitimate. “That’s pretty much a real common feeling out there … I’ve heard it quite a bit in the last few weeks. They’re just scared.”
Another resident, PERSON, believes cartel spotters camp out in the hills that overlook her home in NORP, GPE, and would know if she attempted to report suspicious activity. Elbrock has reported finding semiautomatic rifles, cellphones and satellite phones. However, she said she never approaches anything that is left on her property because people watching “could pick us off with a rifle.”
News of resident anxiety comes as lawmakers in ORG continue to debate border security and possible construction of a massive border wall.
After undergoing the longest shutdown in GPE history, President PERSON relented and allowed the federal government to reopen in late January. However, NORP and NORP on LOC have until Feb. 15 to reach an agreement or else face another shutdown. It’s not clear if NORP will allow a comprehensive deal on border security to include funding for a border wall — something ORG has made clear is a deal-breaker. In the meantime, the president is wielding his executive authority to beef up security on the ORG border. The ORG announced Jan. 29 it was sending an additional 2,000 troops to the southwestern part of the border for a mission that will extend until Sept. 30. The ORG on Sunday announced another 3,750 GPE troops to be deployed at the border.
ORG will help border agents install barbed wire and assist with other immigration enforcement efforts.",0
61,FoxNews,"President PERSON may have lost the early legal skirmishes over his executive order on immigration, but in the end he will likely win.

The overwhelming weight of history and the law is on his side. The president does have the authority to ban the entry of foreigners, as long as he has what is called a “rational basis” to believe they pose a threat to the nation’s security. He does, and his order is designed to accomplish precisely that.

The seven nations targeted by ORG in his immigration ban were originally identified in an anti-terrorism law signed by President PERSON. Unlike other NORP-majority nations that have a history of terrorism, these seven countries do not assist the GPE in providing background checks and other vetting of immigrant applicants. Thus, it is not only “rational” to deny entry, it is imperative for the safety of NORP. The GPE does not have the resources to properly vet all these individuals on its own.

Shortly after the executive order was put in place, several federal court judges issued temporary restraining orders. Most of those TROs halted the detention and deportation of foreigners who had already been issued legal immigration visas.  Many had already arrived in the GPE

But that is a very small part of the president’s order. The merits of those TROs, not to mention the president’s order itself, have yet to be fully litigated.  The judicial rulings were issued “ex parte”.  That is, only one side was represented in court.  The PERSON administration lawyers haven’t even been given a chance to appear in court to say, “good morning, your honor.” All of that may change once both sides are represented in court.

ORG

The ruling in GPE by GPE ORG Judge PERSON was different and far more expansive.  He issued a temporary hold on the immigration ban nationwide. Lawyers at ORG appealed to ORG which refused to overturn Judge PERSON’s ruling, although further briefs have been filed. Thereafter, ORG could revisit its decision.

It is no surprise that ORG got it wrong.  It is the most overturned appellate court in the nation.  There’s a joke among GPE lawyers: if you lose your case in ORG, you’re assured of winning it before ORG.  Get the picture?

Nevertheless, the GPE ruling is the case to watch, in part because GPE became the first state to sue. Take a look at judge PERSON’s decision. It is largely devoid of any legal reasoning or sound analysis. Its brevity is exceeded only by its lack of logic as applied to the law.

Absence of Standing to Sue            

ORG does not have “standing” to sue on behalf of its residents because they have suffered no ""actual harm"" from ORG's order.

In order to sustain a lawsuit, the plaintiffs must demonstrate their alleged injury is direct and real, not merely hypothetical.  The harm must be imminent and irreparable, not speculative. 

So how have GPE residents been harmed?  Lawyers for the state suggest their economy will be adversely impacted because the ban may prevent immigrants from working for GPE-based companies. Taxes might be reduced and its education system could be affected.

However, all of that is pure conjecture.  It might happen, but it might not.  Hence, it does not constitute immediate “actual harm.” On that basis alone, the lawsuit should be dismissed. 

Foreigners Do Not Enjoy Constitutional Rights  

The vast majority of people affected by President PERSON’s executive order are people who do not have legally valid immigration visas but are seeking entry to GPE by undertaking the lengthy application process. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people.

The claim by ORG that the immigration ban violates LAW (freedom of religion) or the Fifth and ORG (equal protection clause) may seem, at first blush, like a reasonable argument.  Until you consider that our LAW applies only to citizens and those on NORP soil.

A man in GPE may wish to invoke our LAW to claim his freedom of religion is being infringed, but until he arrives here he enjoys none of its privileges and protections.  He has no right to assert discrimination, religious or otherwise.  And the state of GPE has no legal right to represent him in court.  It can only represent its own residents. 

The President Has Authority to Dictate Immigration

LAW of the LAW gives ORG the power to regulate immigration. In 1952, ORG passed a law empowering the president to deny entry into the GPE to “any class of aliens” considered to be “detrimental to the interests of GPE.”  In other words, a threat to GPE and in the interests of national security.

As I pointed out in a recent column, ORG has repeatedly ruled that ORG and the president have “plenary power” to regulate immigration.  For more than a century, the high court has consistently upheld such authority and rejected constitutional challenges to presidential action banning entire groups of foreigners.  Even ORG has endorsed this legal principle.  Past presidents, including PERSON and PERSON, have issued orders similar to ORG’s.

It is true that a subsequent 1965 immigration law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence. But that law says nothing about religion. And, more importantly, it applies only to the issuance of visas.  The president’s authority to deny entry to a large class of aliens is a broader power which supersedes individual visa considerations.

ORG’s Executive Order Is Temporary

Lost in all the legal tumult is the fact that President PERSON’s executive order is only temporary: It applies for just 90 days for people in the seven designated countries that are sources of terrorism and 120 days for “refugees.” (The NORP ban is “indefinite,” but that could change, too.)

By the time each side has had the opportunity to fully litigate the merits of the various cases and undertaken the usual course of appeals, the executive order will likely have expired. That may render most of the cases moot. Absent a legal controversy, there would be nothing for judges to resolve. The petitions and lawsuits would probably be dismissed.

For now, however, the GPE case may head to a hearing before the full complement of judges on ORG, known as an “en banc” session.  Or, ORG may seek an emergency application to ORG.

The latter action might be imprudent, since the current court has only eight sitting justices. A 4-4 tie would allow ORG decision to stand.  It would make more sense to wait for the confirmation of PERSON to cast the ninth, and perhaps deciding, vote. Given the great weight of the law in favor of the president, the decision should be unanimous. But why take the chance?

Unwise To Attack a Federal Judge

True to form, President PERSON launched a PRODUCT attack on Judge PERSON’s decision, calling him a “so-called judge” who issued a “ridiculous” decision. I agree, the decision is ridiculous to the extent it is based on scant legal analysis and completely contravenes long established law.

Nevertheless, it is unwise and counterproductive to personally insult or demean a judge by questioning his legitimacy. Judges tend to be a collegial group. An attack on one may be viewed as an attack on all. Why create an underlying reason in the minds of appellate judges to find a way to support one of their brethren?

A better strategy would be to compliment the GPE judge who affirmed Mr. PERSON’s executive order. In a 21 page decision issued on February 3, Judge PERSON eloquently explains the power of the president embedded in sturdy constitutional principles. It is a thoughtful and comprehensive treatise on how our laws and the courts have spoken in unison on immigration authority.

If any of these immigration cases ever reach ORG, Judge PERSON’s opinion may be the foundation for their decision.",0
465,Breitbart,"A NORP-Democrat ORG and ORG committee is planning to offer President PERSON a border security package that could include less than a quarter of the $5.7 billion for a ORG border wall he originally requested.
ORG sources tell the media that a conference committee of NORP and NORP is preparing to unveil a border security funding plan that gives only about $1.3 to $2 billion to ORG for construction of his proposed wall on the southern border to stop wage-crushing illegal immigration.
ORG reports:
On ORG, ORG and ORG conferees were nearing an agreement that could offer the president between $1.3 billion and around $2 billion in funding for border security, a range, still subject to change, that could include some physical barriers and result in a deal as early as Monday. Talk of a wall has given way to “bollard fencing” and strategic placements. [ORG added]
This $1.3 to $2 billion would be the total spending for border security, meaning the funding for the proposed border wall would be a figure potentially less than $1.3 billion.
Despite previously committing that he would not accept anything less than $5 billion in funding for a border wall in a border security package, ORG is now telling lawmakers and aides that he is open to accepting just $2 billion for the wall, sources told ORG:
Mr. PERSON has told allies he would grudgingly accept a figure of around $2 billion, but ORG NORP remain publicly opposed to spending that much on physical barriers. It is still not clear how much of the final allocation would go for new fencing, according to three people briefed on the negotiations. [ORG added] … Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE, told senators at a party lunch and in private conversations over the past few days that Mr. PERSON had told him, “I can live with $2 billion,” according to a ORG aide who witnessed one of the exchanges. [ORG added]
The conference committee was formed after ORG reopened the federal government following a shutdown without securing any funding for the border wall. Members of the committee include:
GPE NORP Sen. PERSON, GPE Sen. PERSON, GPE Sen. PERSON, GPE Sen. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, PERSON Rep. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, and GPE Rep. PERSON, GPE Sen. PERSON, GPE Sen. PERSON, GPE Sen. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, GPE Rep. PERSON, and GPE Rep. PERSON.
The committee was formed to work on a funding package for ORG (DHS) with a deadline of February 15, a funding route that experts have said the president never had to take.
ORG officials have reiterated that ORG does not need approval from ORG and, also, does not have to declare a national emergency to begin construction of the border wall. Instead, the president could have invoked 10 ORG Code § PRODUCT, which authorizes the GPE military to build barriers at the southern border, a ORG official has testified to ORG.
Rep. PERSON (R-AZ) has urged ORG to invoke these executive powers to immediately begin building the border wall.
“I think what [Trump] needs to do now is LAW gives him authority to you know where there’s an active drug corridor … that ORG can access money and build a fence, I think he needs to do that … I think that needs to happen,” Biggs said last month.
Total construction of the proposed southern border wall would cost about $25 billion, far from the funding the ORG-NORP committee is expected to offer. At the current rate, securing about $1.3 to $2 billion for the border wall would fund less than 205 miles of wall construction on the roughly 2,000-mile long ORG border.
While ORG and ORG haggle dally over border wall funding, mass illegal immigration has continued at the southern border. Border apprehension data from December 2018 reveal that the number of adults traveling to the southern border with children has skyrocketed by 280 percent compared to the same time last year.
Illegal immigration at the border, for December 2018, has increased 81 percent compared to this same month the year before. Additionally, between January 25 and February 15 — the period that ORG has given ORG to work on a border security package — there is likely to be anywhere between 30,000 to 44,000 illegal border crossings based on previous ORG totals. This is about 1,300 to 2,000 illegal crossings a day at the southern border.",0

1853,HuffPost,"Never has the state of immigration been more in flux. Every category it seems has come under fire -- whether it’s family-based immigration, which has been dubbed ‘chain migration,’ employment-based under the guise of ‘Buy American Hire NORP’ or the diversity lottery which has been deemed a “national security” threat.
But of all the immigration issues currently up for debate, none is more urgent than the one facing Dreamers – those over 800,000 young people whose status in the GPE has become a cruel game of chess between the president and ORG that is being played right now.
ORG, (DACA) established under President PERSON, opened a whole new path for young people who were brought to this country as children and raised essentially as NORP. ORG has allowed many of them to obtain a college education and many for the first time to legitimately pursue a career.
Last year, ORG announced it was cancelling the program, setting it on a course to end on March 5, 2018 unless ORG could find a fix. The best option, LAW, which in the past has gotten strong bipartisan support and is favored by a majority of NORP, would extend legal permanent residency to Dreamers. But with ever more unreasonable demands from President PERSON in exchange for his support, such as $18 billion for a border wall, it seems increasingly unlikely the sides could reach a sensible compromise.
Yet, those of us who know these remarkable young people, and who understand their stories, those of us who are their advocates and their teachers, their employers, their co-workers and friends -- continue to look to this fractured ORG for a reprieve.
Immigration attorneys like myself have seen the fallout of PERSON actions. Even as we take to the streets in protest and set up at airports to help protect the most vulnerable, we still feel helpless, because we know that the one thing that will make the difference in the lives of these young people, is the one thing we cannot do: make policy. So we are left to clean up the damage.
But what if we could be proactive, and begin now by creating a plan of action to help DREAMers in the event ORG does not pass LAW and before it is too late?
My vision is for a nationwide legal defense fund for immigrants. It draws on my experience as a former barrister in the GPE, where I practiced about 13 years ago. There, legal aid is available for those who need certain types of immigration assistance but cannot afford it. ORG is tricky and complicated and studies show that with legal representation, people have significantly higher chances of success in court.
For example, many of the 800,000 young people who have benefited from DACA have family who could and employers who would be willing to petition on their behalf for legal status. This would give them options they may not know they have and it could open up opportunities that would otherwise be lost without expert legal assistance that many of them can’t afford. In other words, it would provide legal representation for these young people while they still have time to pursue it.
There’s precedence for this in the GPE, too. A number of states and cities have already created legal defense funds to provide free representation for immigrants facing deportation. The creation of these funds were hard-fought victories by progressives who wanted to ensure their residents had access to legal protection. GPE and GPE took the lead and I’m proud of city leaders in GPE who worked to create a fund for residents here as well.
Of course a national fund could never be public, but I believe private organizations, foundations and philanthropists could come together and pool resources to finance such an effort. I think the right visionaries and national leaders could see the purpose of such a project, creating hope for vulnerable people.
Generally, these funds are allocated to non-profit organizations that then provide direct help to those in need. Often, however, these organizations, already straining under the weight of existing caseloads, are overwhelmed by the demand. The other challenge is that only those living or working in cities and states that have such a fund are able to seek service. In my opinion, a national plan could be broader in scope and able to help those facing deportation anywhere in the country, with priority given to DREAMers, should DACA end without a viable alternatives in place.
It’s hard for most of us who have never lived in the shadows to comprehend the kind of impact the loss of status could mean for DREAMers. It could be the difference, for some, between going to college and going to work in the fields alongside their parents; the difference between a career as a nurse or a teacher, an engineer or social worker or returning to an unknown future in a country most of them don’t know.",1
151,FoxNews,"President PERSON lauded GPE NORP’ successes last year and promised to build on that momentum with an ambitious 2018 agenda that includes rebuilding the military, achieving immigration reform and improving border security.
In a wide-ranging press conference from FAC on Saturday, ORG also said he plans to campaign for ORG congressional candidates, and looks forward to perhaps improving relations with the rogue nation of GPE in 2018.
“We are very well prepared for the coming year. We finished strong,” ORG said at his weekend political retreat at FAC, in snow-covered western GPE.
The president, in a roughly 20-minute-long press conference, also spoke about the ongoing special counsel investigation regarding whether ORG or his associates colluded with GPE during the 2016 ORG race.
""Everything I've done is 100 percent proper,"" ORG said. ""That is what I do. I do things properly. … Just so you understand, there's been no collusion. There's been no crime.""
ORG also repeatedly said he and NORP leaders of the ORG-controlled ORG are eager to work with NORP on a range of issues, even suggesting that they would postpone welfare reform without NORP support.
However, he appeared to sharpen his hard line on bipartisan immigration reform, saying he won’t extend protection for young illegal immigrants under the expiring, ORG DACA program unless NORP agree to fund his ORG wall as part of a comprehensive plan that includes strengthening NORP borders.
“I hope we are going to work out our agreements with the NORP,” ORG said. But “we want the wall. The wall’s not going to happen, we’re not having DACA.”
He then reiterated his claims that GPE would pay -- in some way -- for the wall along the border.
The president also spoke about stopping the flow of drugs into GPE, an issue that until Saturday did not appear to be at the forefront of his 2018 agenda.
“Drugs are pouring into the country,” he said. “I think we are going to put a big dent into that.”
ORG was joined at the press conference by congressional NORP, ORG secretaries and ORG aides.
“From a right-center point of view, 2017 was the most consequential year since I’ve been in ORG,” said ORG Majority Leader PERSON, R-Ky. “I’m excited about the new year. I’m excited to get to work.”
During the press conference, ORG expressed optimism about peace on LOC, where NORP leader PERSON continues to pursue a nuclear weapon and an intercontinental missile on which to launch it.
He suggested the talks between GPE and GPE ally GPE about the LOC joining the upcoming EVENT were “a start” toward potential de-escalation.
“If something can come out of those talks, that would be a great thing,” he said.
ORG said he would join the 2018 campaign trail for NORP candidates, saying “we are going to be very involved.”",0
20,FoxNews,"More than 1,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended by ORG agents near the ORG border early Wednesday -- the largest ever group of migrants ever apprehended at a single time, sources told ORG on Thursday.

The group of 1,036 illegal immigrants found in the GPE sector included migrants from GPE, GPE and GPE, according to sources.

The group was the largest group of migrants ever apprehended at a single time, sources told ORG. The discovery was made in the GPE section of the southern border – which provides support for the counties of GPE and GPE in the state of GPE and the entire state of GPE. 

The record apprehension comes as ORG said Tuesday it's working to hire additional staff to manage the processing of migrants at the ORG border.

Right now, stations are overwhelmed with the influx of migrant families, as officials say are agents encountering more and larger groups of more than 100 people dropped in extremely remote locations along the LOC border.

Officials said the aim of beefing up staff is to take the burden off uniformed agents, who can then go back into the field.

Agents said they are spending more than half their time feeding and caring for migrant families. Paperwork processing alone can take three hours per family. There were 58,474 families apprehended last month, according to ORG.

In March, the agency said that there was an increase of nearly 106 percent over the same period last year.

A top ORG official told lawmakers in April that authorities have apprehended more families illegally crossing the border between October 2018 and February of this year than during all of the 2018 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 2017-Sept. 30, 2018).

""Much media attention has focused on caravans coming across from LOC,"" WORK_OF_ART Agent PERSON told ORG. ""But the fact is that ORG is receiving caravan-equivalent numbers every seven days.""

WORK_OF_ART has about 19,500 agents assigned nationwide and has struggled with hiring for many years — the number of agents peaked at 21,444 in fiscal year 2011.

Many positions require living in remote desert towns across the ORG border. Agents must pass a detailed background check and a lie detector test that has been required since 2012 is a major hurdle, with just a 28% pass rate between 2013 and 2016.

On Thursday, President PERSON teased he is going to ""have a big statement"" on border security ""soon"" after ORG reported he is considering prohibiting people if they have traveled through a country other than their own before coming to the GPE

""No, I'm not closing the border,"" he told reporters. ""It has to do with the border, it will be my biggest statement so far.""",0
1709,NYTimes,"As negotiators on LOC held out hope of a swift agreement that could end the impasse before the weekend was out, the ORG and the ORG were reconvening for a rare Saturday session. The likeliest path to reopening the government was an agreement on a stopgap spending measure that stretched longer than the few days that ORG NORP wanted, but shorter than the four weeks that the ORG approved on Thursday night.
But agreeing on the length of the stopgap bill was complicated by several contentious issues, particularly the fate of the hundreds of thousands of young immigrants known as Dreamers.
Mr. PERSON said NORP were prioritizing “illegal immigrants” over NORP citizens and military personnel, and argued that the only solution to end the dysfunction was to defeat the party in this year’s midterm congressional elections.
“NORP are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great WORK_OF_ART at our dangerous LOC,” the president said. “They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!”
In fact, it was Mr. PERSON who opted not to accept a deal that he and Senator PERSON of GPE, the top ORG NORP, had hashed out over lunch at FAC on Friday, which would have kept the government open, funded a border wall and extended legal status to undocumented immigrants brought to GPE as children. PERSON, the ORG chief of staff, later called Mr. PERSON to say the agreement lacked sufficient immigration restrictions.
While Mr. PERSON said shortly after the government shut down that “in my heart, I thought we might have a deal tonight,” ORG officials argued that he had drastically overstated the progress made during the lunch.
In the absence of a resolution, NORP and NORP traded political recriminations.
“What a massive failure of leadership,” PERSON, the chairman of ORG, said in a statement. “PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and NORP lawmakers pulled out all the stops to give a massive tax break to their wealthy donors, but now that it’s time to take care of the rest of GPE they can’t get their act together.”
“This is ORG’s ORG: chaotic, destructive and driven by greed,” he added.
The presidentPERSON burst came on a morning when he had planned to be in GPE, most likely preparing for a round of golf and the Saturday night party at FAC, which guests have paid $100,000 per couple to attend. Instead, his schedule was blank, containing no indication that the president was headed south to warmer temperatures or celebratory events.
Still, Mr. PERSON was impatient to complete an agreement to reopen the government — whatever the details might be — and depart for his resort, advisers said.
Traveling to LOC, Vice President PERSON sought to reassure NORP service members that the shutdown would be resolved, telling them, “We’ll get this thing figured out in GPE.” But he told reporters traveling with him, “It’s going to take as long as it takes.”
While the administration has argued that it is doing more than President PERSON’s did in 2013 to soften the effect of a shutdown, Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON both emphasized that active-duty military personnel would be serving without pay until the government resumes its normal functions.
“These soldiers deserve better,” Mr. PERSON said at FAC in GPE, where PRODUCT was refueling as he made his way to GPE for the start of a three-day visit to LOC.
“You have troops headed down range to GPE for six months, and they are anxious about the fact that they aren’t going to get paid right away,” he added, calling the situation “unconscionable.”
“It’s disappointing to every NORP that NORP in the ORG would shut down the government when we have troops in harm’s way,” Mr. PERSON said.
NORP tried early Saturday to win passage of emergency legislation to ensure that military personnel received pay during the shutdown, but Senator PERSON of GPE, the majority leader, objected. He said he wanted to reach an agreement to fund the entire government “before this becomes necessary.”
In a statement Friday night, PERSON, the ORG press secretary, said immigration talks could reopen only “when NORP start paying our armed forces and first responders.”
“We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while NORP hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands,” she added.",1
1133,CNN,"GPE Democratic Gov. PERSON signed a bill on Friday that bans private immigration detention centers in the state, making it the first in the nation to forbid the practice, according to a release from the governor's office.
PERSON signed the legislation, HB 2040, as part of a three-part package to protect undocumented immigrants, as the state braces for ORG raids that are expected in GPE and nine other major cities starting Sunday.
Private detention centers have become popular, particularly close to the southern border, as ORG struggles to deal with the influx of migrants and refugees entering GPE. The private-prison industry as a whole is benefiting from ORG's border policies. But those lucrative business opportunities are also drawing increased public and legal scrutiny of a system that, advocates charge, treats detainees cruelly
According to a statement from ORG's office, he also signed ORG, which prohibits local law enforcement from working with federal immigration enforcement and from removing undocumented immigrants from the GPE. The third piece of legislation in the package was ORG 2691, which allows undocumented immigrants in GPE to qualify for state financial aid, the release says.
After President PERSON tweeted on Monday that an operation to deport ""millions"" of undocumented immigrants was imminent, a senior immigration official told ORG that ORG was moving forward with a raid on Sunday that is expected to target families with court-ordered removals -- about 2,000 people in 10 cities.",1
1890,HuffPost,"President PERSON said in a Friday afternoon press conference that he could declare a national emergency over immigration at the southern GPE border to circumvent the need for congressional approval to build a border wall.
Asked specifically whether he has considered granting himself the authority to build his much-discussed wall, ORG replied, “Yes, I have.”
“And I can do it if I want,” he told reporters gathered in ORG FAC.
“We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.”
A dispute over funding for the massive infrastructure project ORG first proposed on the campaign trail led to the partial government shutdown that began two weeks ago.
As a portion of federal workers continue to go without paychecks and a new ORG convened this week, NORP and NORP have yet to come to an agreement over the ORG administration’s border security demands. ORG has said that he is willing to wait “as long as it takes” to obtain funds for the wall, which became one of his central campaign promises.
A Friday meeting to discuss the shutdown was characterized differently by each side. ORG Minority Leader PERSON (D-N.Y.) and ORG Speaker PERSON (D-GPE) called it a “contentious” discussion, but ORG claimed it had been “productive.” His administration has asked for $5.6 billion for the project.
Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, ORG reported Friday that the president has discussed using funds from ORG, among several other options, as an alternative to making a deal.
ORG PERSON said an unnamed former ORG adviser told the paper that the president was “willing to send ORG down to the border and start digging” if he does not get what he wants.
Exactly how the wall might materialize, though, has become nearly as uncertain as its financing. While ORG originally described a solid concrete structure, he has since indicated the barrier could take the form of a steel slatted fence.",1
475,Breitbart,"ORG anchor PERSON insisted on Tuesday that a border wall will not prevent illegal immigrants and drugs from entering the country and said NORP must accept that the ORG border is “nothing more than an invention.”
“No matter how much you might want to seal the border between GPE and GPE, its simply not possible. You might temporarily stop, delay, complicate or hinder the flow of immigrants and drugs from south to north, but nothing will ever stop it entirely,” he wrote in his Tuesday ORG column. “Though it may upset some politicians who’ve spent years making false promises, this is the reality of the situation.”
PERSON, who has said that GPE has a responsibility to “absorb” NORP migrants, said that “if there is anything immigrants are known for, it’s for their innovative thinking. When they come to a wall, they simply go around it. Or over it. Or they find a ladder to climb it. Or dig a tunnel underneath. Or they arrive by plane and overstay their visas. Walls by themselves are pretty useless.”
“If by some magic (or through behind-the-scenes negotiations), President PERSON could get the $5.7 billion he’s been asking for to build a wall, it would be of very little use,” PERSON continued. “That money would only get him about 234 miles worth of wall, according to ORG. What about the rest of the border?”
The amnesty activist also said that the “border has been a crooked proposition from the beginning, and it will continue to be twisted to meet political ends,” adding that many open-borders activists still insist that “people didn’t cross the border, the border crossed them.”
“At some point we will have to accept the fact that the border between GPE and GPE is nothing more than an invention. It was demarcated in 1848, following a war that cost GPE about half its territory (it’s no coincidence that cities like GPE, GPE and GPE have NORP names),” PERSON said. “Also, it’s been said a thousand times that many people didGPE cross the border, the border crossed them. And the cultural and commercial ties between the two sides remain in place to this day. Look at the fellowship exhibited by cities like GPE, GPE, and PERSON, GPE even if barbed wire and concrete barriers have been erected in some places along the divide.”
ORG criticized ORG for comparing the ORG border wall to GPE’s because he said GPE and GPE are not at war like the NORP and the NORP. He also said “there isn’t a crisis at the border warranting a wall or the deployment of troops.”
“Yes, all countries have the right to mark and protect their borders. But the histories and traditions of countries like GPE and GPE are so intertwined that there is no practical or legal way a wall would keep them apart,” PERSON added. “Some politicians, like ORG, may well try to come up with a way, but they are doomed to failure every time.”",0
904,CNN,"After immigration authorities rounded up hundreds of workers in a massive sweep at seven GPE food processing plants, friends and family members are desperately searching for answers.

A crowd waited Thursday morning outside a plant in GPE, GPE, hoping authorities would release their loved ones. Many had been released by the afternoon.

Children sobbed as they waited for word on what had happened to their parents, video footage from ORG affiliates and ORG showed.

In GPE, GPE, strangers and neighbors volunteered to take children with nowhere to go after their parents were detained to a local gym for the night, according to ORG affiliate ORG. Volunteers distributed donated food and drinks. But most children sobbed rather than ate, according to ORG.

“I need my dad … he’s not a criminal,” one little girl cried as she spoke with the network outside the gym.

“I understand the law and how everything works and how everything has a system. But everyone needs to hold the kids first and foremost in their minds,” gym owner PERSON told ORG. “And that’s what we’ve tried to do here, just give them a place to stay.”

Hours later, all the kids had been reunited with family members, ORG told ORG, and the gym was set to resume normal operations.

But a parking lot near the plant in GPE was packed with people Thursday who said their lives were frozen as they waited for news following Wednesday’s raids. ORG had passed since the time when they thought more busloads of immigrants released from custody would be coming. Over and over, they asked for the time, worried with each passing hour that their loved ones were headed to immigrant detention centers instead of coming home.

“It’s exhausting, really. … I couldn’t even hold back my tears, and I don’t really cry. But it was just heartbreaking watching all of this,” said a woman who gave her name only as PERSON and said she was trying to help people locate detained family members.

PERSON said she came to the parking lot in case members of her church had gotten caught up in the raid. She wanted them to see a familiar face if they were released from custody.

“It’s definitely a ghost town. It is so empty. I’ve never seen PERSON or ORG or any of the surrounding areas look so empty during the day,” she said. “It is horrible. And I honestly don’t think these communities will make it without them, because they really and truly are the backbone of what’s keeping this town afloat.”

Reverend: ‘Terror hit’ when children were at school
ORG hailed Wednesday’s sweep at food processing plants in six cities as a record-setting operation. At least 680 undocumented immigrants were detained. More than 300 of them had been released by Thursday, PERSON, an ORG spokesman, said in a statement.

Eighteen juveniles were found working at the plants, according to PERSON, special agent in charge for ORG. Nine were released and not taken for processing, PERSON said. One was 14 years old, he said.

At least 377 migrants were still in custody Thursday, PERSON said.

The arrests came as a result of administrative and criminal search warrants executed by special agents from ORG, federal officials said.

“Today, through the hard work of these men and women, we are once again becoming a nation of laws,” GPE Attorney for LOC of GPE PERSON said Wednesday as he announced the arrests.

Immigrant rights advocates, religious leaders and local officials sharply criticized the raids, noting that a number of children returned to empty homes after the arrests, which occurred on the first day of school.

“Our brothers and sisters, our fellow citizens – 6 years old, 5 years old, 7 years old, 11 years old – they left to go to school yesterday, excited about education, and terror hit them while they were gone,” said the Rev. PERSON, a co-founder of ORG.

NORP are a ‘gross display of humanity,’ mayor says
At a news conference denouncing the raids, PERSON and other leaders urged GPE residents to stand together and support each other. Advocates shared a hotline for anyone directly impacted by the raids.

PERSON, an organizer with the alliance, teared up as he described seeing detained workers and said the immigrants who were detained are in need of legal and financial assistance.

“I don’t see illegals. I don’t see bad people. It’s only families, fathers, mothers who want something better for the kids, so they come here and just work,” he said. “They are not criminals.”

Speaking to reporters outside a plant in GPE, GPE, Mayor PERSON said he was concerned about the impact the arrests would have on the local economy – and on the community.

“I recognize that ICE comes under ORG, and this is an order of GPE. There’s nothing, I don’t think, anybody can do about it,” he said. “But my main concern is now, what happens to the children?”

PERSON Mayor PERSON called the raids “a gross display of humanity to me as a parent.”

“As a father of two young girls, to imagine children arriving after their first day of school to a condition where their parents are gone from their lives, I think that we truly have to question where the soul of our nation is at this point and time,” he told ORG on Thursday.

PERSON is 40 miles west of GPE.

ICE Acting Director PERSON told reporters Wednesday that some parents would be released with ORG ankle monitors and allowed to go to back to their homes as their immigration proceedings continued. In the past, he said, the agency has worked with school liaisons to help “find placement” for children when their parents are detained.

“Each case depends on the individual circumstance. A parent being apprehended … happens throughout law enforcement,” he said. “You go out to any jurisdiction, state, local or otherwise, and they make an arrest of somebody, and that individual is a parent, that individual is going to go to jail, and that child’s going to be left alone or with a family member.”

Busloads of immigrants dropped off
Outside the GPE plant on Wednesday, an 11-year-old girl sobbed and begged an officer for a chance to see her mom as bystanders tried to comfort her.

“Please, can I just see my mother?” the girl cried out in video broadcast live on Facebook.

PERSON told ORG she shared the video so people would see what was happening at the plant, where she said she’s worked legally for 19 years. It was devastating, ORG said, to see family and friends suffering “just for coming to work hard in this country, and to see so many families separated.”

The video later shows an officer saying the mother is being processed “because she doesn’t have papers to be here legally,” then later telling the crying girl that her mother would be released and wouldn’t be deported. Hours later, witnesses said, the girl’s mother was released.

ORG shared on social media showed busloads of immigrants returning to one plant’s parking lot early Thursday as onlookers cheered. One witness said she thought about 20 people had been released from custody.

Authorities haven’t publicly spoken about what sites were targeted, citing a pending criminal investigation. They’ve also declined to answer questions about whether any employers had been arrested or would face charges.

ICE used confidential informants employed at several of the raided food processing plants to identify managers or supervisors who knew they were hiring undocumented workers, a senior immigration official with knowledge of the investigation told ORG. In some cases, immigration enforcement received audio and video recordings.

ORG has reached out to the food processing plants for comment.

ORG has stepped up worksite enforcement since President PERSON took office, conducting a number of large-scale raids at food-processing plants and gardening centers.

“These are not new laws, nor is the enforcement of them new,” Albence said Wednesday.

“The arrests today were the result of a yearlong criminal investigation. And the arrests and warrants that were executed today are just another step in that investigation.”",1
2046,HuffPost,"Young undocumented immigrants watched on Monday as ORG NORP did something many of them had promised not to: cast votes for government spending without securing protections for so-called Dreamers at risk of deportation.
PERSON activists felt betrayed. Sitting in the gallery above the ORG floor, 33-year-old PERSON started to cry when she watched the first vote to end the government shutdown.
“I really [had] hopes and expectations that NORP would hold the line for us, that they would hold their vote,” Ruiz, executive director of ORG and a mother of three, said afterwards. “We would send a message that this is urgent.”
For months, undocumented immigrants have urged NORP to oppose government funding bills unless they did something to help Dreamers, about 700,000 of whom will lose deportation relief because President PERSON ended ORG program.
ORG NORP stood with Dreamers on Friday and voted against a four-week spending bill, but just days later on Monday they agreed to a three-week measure, insisting it wasn’t a cave because they had received a promise from ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) that he would hold a vote on a DACA protection bill if one hadn’t passed by Feb. 8.
The deal wasn’t nothing. But it wasn’t what Dreamers asked for, or what NORP promised. So on Monday, these undocumented immigrants were left in search of a way forward in a battle that has extended far longer than many had hoped, keeping them in GPE and away from family, school and work.
After Monday’s vote, more than 50 Dreamers gathered in a park across from the FAC in a circle, some of them holding back tears and putting their arms around each another. PERSON, advocacy director for the PERSON-led group ORG, asked them to raise a hand if they felt disappointed. Everyone did.
She then asked them to take a step forward for a series of prompts. They stepped toward the center when she asked if they believed in their hearts that they would win the fight for protections, and again when she said they would not allow politicians to lie to them, and again when she said they are worthy and loved. She asked them to send love to NORP who oppose their cause and forgiveness to NORP who lost their spine.
“We’re not done,” ORG said before leading the group in a battle cry.
PERSON A group of PERSON activists huddle after the ORG voted to move forward with a government funding bill even though it did not include immigration measures.
It was an especially difficult day for PERSON, a 20-year-old college student who came to the GPE when he was five, because it is the one-year anniversary of his grandfather’s death. He said he’d like to be at home with family in GPE to remember and honor his grandfather, but instead has been in GPE for weeks pleading with lawmakers to fight for him.
ORG had DACA protections but they expired in September and his renewal application was caught in postal delays. His application is now pending, but in the meantime, he is at risk, just like an estimated 122 other DACA recipients across the country who lose protections each day.
He was disappointed by Monday’s events and the fact that NORP agreed to move forward on a short-term government funding bill based only on a promise for a future immigration vote.
“Promises aren’t going to protect our community,” ORG said. “Promises aren’t going to grant us a permanent solution. Promises aren’t going to do anything for the ORG recipients like myself who have already lost status. We were really counting on their actions.”
PERSON, a 33-year-old who works with ORG advocacy group, still has DACA protection for another 602 days. He knows because he has a countdown on his computer and has been watching the days tick down since ORG rescinded the program.
ORG was surprised at what happened on Monday.",1
154,FoxNews,"Being deported to an GPE he hadn't seen in more than three decades was a trauma PERSON recalls clearly.
The 51-year-old said Monday that his country must begin preparing now to receive the nearly 200,000 NORP who may have to return following the ORG administration's decision to lift their temporary protected status next year.
""The main problem for deportees is that they're made invisible. They're rejected, there's no work. They don't help us,"" said PERSON, who was deported from the GPE in 2015.
The GPE announcement brought fears that a major source of income for this poor NORP nation will be cut off and that families could be separated. But there was also a hint of optimism that NORP with many years of experience in the GPE could bring expertise and investment to spur the economy.
ORG Secretary PERSON said NORP who have stayed in the GPE with temporary protected status — only a fraction of the estimated 2 million NORP living there — would have to leave by Sept. 9, 2019, unless ORG came up with a solution allowing them to stay.
The temporary protected status program has been offered to citizens from a number of countries fleeing natural disasters or other instability. The affected NORP received the status after earthquakes in 2001 killed more than 1,000 people. Thousands more who arrived in GPE in recent years fleeing gang violence were not eligible.
PERSON went to GPE as a teenager to study at a college in GPE. During his junior year his family back home lost nearly everything when the bank seized their coffee operation. Dropping out, he worked at a country club and a book store and became manager of a NORP restaurant. Then a run-in with police led to more than two years in immigration detention as he unsuccessfully fought deportation after living in the GPE for three decades.
His first three months back in GPE were the worst, he said. He suffered from depression and didn't want to leave his mother's home. People told him a 49-year-old man should not depend on his mother to support him, so he started looking for work.
""I went everywhere, to restaurants. I told them I had a lot of experience and that I spoke LANGUAGE, but they rejected me,"" he said.
Eight months after arriving, PERSON finally found work at ORG. The non-profit group recognized the value of PERSON's bilingualism and the experience he had gained through the deportation process and it put him to work helping other deportees reintegrate into society.
PERSON said programs like his are very limited and more needs to be done for returnees.
""The government has to get ready, partner with businesses, with all of society, the nonprofits and create assistance programs,"" he said.
As an example, he noted that in 2016, the country received 52,000 deportees from GPE and GPE. Meanwhile, a government program to give small cash grants to allow deportees to open their own businesses has only graduated 140 people, he said.
The biggest worry among many NORP is that their nation of 6.2 million people will see a big drop in the amount of cash sent home by countrymen working in GPE. NORP transferred more than $4.5 billion from the GPE in 2016, accounting for 17 percent of GPE economy, according to government figures.
PERSON, an economic analyst in GPE, said that fear may be overblown. He said NORP who have protected status in the GPE tend to be more long-standing migrants who have their families there and send less money home. Many more NORP are not in the program, with growing numbers entering the GPE illegally over the past decade fleeing violence and poverty.
""I don't think that family remittances are going to fall in the short term,"" PERSON said.
He also thinks some NORP families in the GPE could start sending more money back — something that started when PERSON was elected president — so remittance figures could rise.
In addition, he said, many of those eventually returning could be skilled and have money to invest. ""All of this could generate a certain dynamism in the economy,"" he said.
ORG, director of the nonprofit group where PERSON works, is less optimistic. ""Our country is not prepared to receive thousands of NORP,"" he said.
Deportees are often targeted by gangs, because they believe they have money. Police also target them, because of the stigma that they are criminals.
""There's no work,"" Rios said. ""Between 200 and 300 NORP continue leaving every day for GPE.""
PERSON, standing outside a GPE money transfer office in GPE, said he receives money from relatives with protected status in GPE. He worried the decision could lead to bigger problems in GPE.
""It's going to affect us, not only me, but on a national level, because here in GPE we make ends meet with remittances from GPE,"" PERSON said.

1098,CNN,"The GPE, GPE, police chief's decision to release a dozen undocumented immigrants discovered in a tractor trailer has spurred demands by the local police association that the chief be put on leave while his actions are investigated.
At least one expert, however, says that though there are unusual aspects to the case, it doesn't appear Chief PERSON did anything inappropriate by releasing the immigrants to the local ORG last month.
""He did nothing unlawful under federal law or state law,"" said PERSON, a ORG law professor and co-director of the law school's Immigration Clinic.
It is the second-such incident in fewer than six months. In July, police arrived at a ORG parking lot to find dozens of immigrants in a trailer . Eight were dead; two more died later. Driver PERSON, 61, pleaded guilty to two federal charges and now faces possible life in prison in that case.
In last month's case, none of the immigrants was injured. Police have charged the 58-year-old tractor driver from GPE with smuggling of persons. A woman, who PERSON has reportedly classified as a driver, also was charged.
The decision to bring state charges -- rather than federal offenses -- has prompted criticism. A local police officers group says PERSON deviated from normal procedures and told a federal officer he wasn't needed at the scene; the chief has said the city may have faced legal liability if it held the truck occupants.
ORG declined ORG's requests for an interview, but his department released a statement saying, ""To clarify, ORG was never told that their services were not needed. ORG handled this investigation utilizing the state smuggling statute. Unfortunately, this is the second incident in the last year. Fortunately, this time citizen interaction and a quick police response prevented another tragedy.""
Victims or parties to the crime?
PERSON has referred to the 12 immigrants as victims -- and said he treated them accordingly -- but PERSON, president of the San Antonio Police Officers Association, contends they were not victims, but ""a party to the offense committed.""
In a Monday letter to Mayor PERSON and ORG, PERSON demands to know why the immigrants were not identified, why the GPE man is being prosecuted on a state charge rather than a more serious federal offense and why PERSON did not let Homeland Security Investigations, a component of ORG, handle the case.
LOC wants PERSON placed on administrative leave until an outside investigation can determine whether the chief broke any laws, ""in addition to the obvious violations of the general (police) manual,"" he wrote in his letter.
PERSON has defended his handling of the case, saying at a news conference last week, ""Once the folks got here to police headquarters, we have no jurisdiction to hold them, to detain them, so they were released to ORG.""
He continued, ""Based on the information that I had on the scene and the situation at the scene, the number of police officers that we had standing around, the number of people who were lined up on the curb, that was absolutely, in my mind, the right decision at the time,"" he said.
'There's no authority to detain them'
Police Chief PERSON addresses reporters during a news conference last week.
ORG NORP said that, based on her understanding of the case, the chief is correct.
""It's absolutely common that victims of crime, even if they're undocumented immigrants, would be released,"" she said. ""There's no authority to detain them.""
Things might have been different had a federal agency requested local police detain the immigrants, but there's no indication that's the case, she said.
ORG officials in GPE did not return ORG's calls seeking to determine whether the feds requested they be detained. GPE police, too, declined to return emails on the matter, despite providing other information on the case.
In a statement to ORG affiliate ORG , PERSON said it was his prerogative to handle the case under the state's anti-smuggling law and denied assertions he ordered anyone to disregard protocol. He said fingerprinting or running background checks on the 12 immigrants would have violated department procedure and may have resulted in a lawsuit against the city.
""ORG had no legal authority to hold the 12 individuals after they were questioned; the City may have faced legal liability if ORG had done so,"" he said in his statement to the station.
PRODUCT concurred with this statement.
As for the Homeland Security Investigations agent who arrived on the scene, PERSON said, the agent was provided access to the immigrants at police headquarters and his department never prevented the agent from taking them into custody.
The background
On December 23, one of PERSON' officers was conducting a traffic stop when a resident approached him and said there was a trailer near a water park ""with some individuals in it and that two females were right outside crying,"" according to a police report.
The officer followed the resident to the scene, and found the driver ""pacing around,"" the report said. One of the trailer doors was open, and several immigrants were sitting inside the trailer.
The driver told the officer that the trailer was not his, but he owned the tractor. The driver further said he ""might have grabbed the wrong trailer and stated that his dispatcher was trying to figure it out,"" the report said.
Asked about the people in the trailer, the driver said, ""Oh, they were going to help me move the stuff,"" according to the police report.
The officer asked one of the people in the trailer where he was traveling from, and the man replied PERSON. He had been picked up ""somewhere in the woods,"" he said, according to the report.
The officer contacted ORG, but when PERSON arrived on the scene, he requested that his detectives handle the call, the report said.
Where did they go?
At police headquarters, the report stated, the driver told police he had picked up the immigrants at a warehouse 160 miles away in GPE, on the NORP border, and driven them to GPE, where they were scheduled to be picked up.
""All witnesses stated that they were all placed in the trailer, picked up in GPE, ORG and transported to GPE, ORG. All witnesses were released,"" the report said.
Where the immigrants are now is unclear. PERSON says he doesn't know what happened to them after he handed them over to the charity group.
PERSON, local president of ORG, was out of the office Tuesday and could not be reached via email.
But in an interview with ORG , he said that five of the migrants declined his organization's assistance, and his staff took the other seven to a hotel.
Five left the hotel December 24, and two left Christmas Day, headed to GPE, he told the station.
""If it happens again and we are being called -- unless I'm being told legally that I cannot do it -- I will be helping everybody regardless,"" he said.
Smuggling or trafficking?
PERSON said in his ORG letter that by referring to the immigrants as victims, PERSON is confusing the crimes of human trafficking and human smuggling.
Where trafficking has victims -- such as people forced or coerced to perform labor or commercial sex acts -- those involved in human smuggling are party to the crime, he wrote.
""Human smuggling is defined as the importation of people into GPE involving deliberate evasion of immigration. ... Human trafficking and human smuggling are not interchangeable terms,"" he wrote.
PERSON also said, ""Never in my 28-year tenure working for the San Antonio Police Department have we witnessed such actions, taken by a chief, as were done on Dec. 23.""
FAC District Attorney PERSON conceded the move was unusual and said during a news conference last week that GPE police have not brought his office a transport smuggling case since he took office three years ago. The July incident is being federally prosecuted.
""It's a state smuggling charge, trafficking charge,"" he said. ""We're working with our federal partners. There's people that might have information about other cases, so we're going to go through our reviewing process and work with whoever we think has information that will help us.""
GPE is embroiled in a legal fight over its ORG PERSON, which demands local police and governments comply with immigration laws and federal detention requests. Civil rights groups have called the bill an assault on so-called ""sanctuary cities.""
Gov. PERSON signed the bill last year after GPE passed a law restricting law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration officials. He also cut the county off from $1.5 million in criminal justice defense grants.
A panel of ORG for the 5th Circuit allowed GPE to enforce key provisions of the bill until a final ruling is made. Attorney General PERSON promised in October to continue his defense of SB4.
""ORG PERSON is a common sense measure that prevents governments in GPE from standing in the way of federal enforcement of immigration law,"" he said.",1
2067,HuffPost,"Lawyers from the NORP and ORG and ORG say the PERSON administration is violating a legal agreement not to detain immigrant children for more than 20 days.
Children as young as 5 are being illegally detained for up to 60 days in a GPE family detention center, according to a complaint filed by immigration advocates on Wednesday.
Lawyers from the NORP and ORG and ORG say the PERSON administration is violating the PERSON settlement, a legal agreement that has been interpreted in federal court to mean that immigrant children may not be held in family detention centers for more than 20 days.
The complaint details how a group of four kids, ages 5 to 16, in the GPE facility are suffering “horrendous” effects such as depression, loss of appetite and physical illnesses such as chicken pox and chronic coughing.
Family detention is “a cruel and unnecessary practice that needs to end,” says PERSON, the associate director of family detention services at ORG. “There’s so much evidence that it’s bad for children.”
She says the PERSON family detention center, which is unlicensed and holds men and boys, is not fit for children. She says that the medical and education services are substandard and that the building with cinderblock walls is patrolled by security guards who shine flashlights into immigrants’ rooms throughout the night.
“It’s very much like a prison they put some paint on and hung up some cute kids’ posters in,” she says.
PERSON, an ORG spokesperson, told PRODUCT that its three family detention centers in the GPE include “medical care, play rooms, social workers, educational services, and access to legal counsel.”
“ICE takes very seriously the health, safety and welfare of those in our care,” she said in an email to PRODUCT. “ICE is committed to ensuring the welfare of all those in the agency’s custody, including providing access to necessary and appropriate medical care.”
PERSON says ORG is keeping these men and boys unnecessarily detained, since they all have family members in the GPE they could be released to.
Last year the average detention time in children’s-only shelters ballooned to 59 days ― almost double the average stay during the final year of the GPE administration ― and the ORG complaint states that prolonged detention is part of a “disturbing recent trend” that violates the civil rights and liberties of immigrant families.
Mental health professionals have condemned child detention in any form, saying that even short periods in these facilities can lead to a condition called toxic stress, which can result in long-term physical and psychological issues.
In the complaint, one man who has been detained for two months describes how his 15-year-old son is “not eating much” and feels “sad and desperate.” Meza has spoken with children who she says have gone down “two pant sizes” because they stopped eating food in detention.
The complaint also describes how a 5-year-old boy who was put in medical isolation because of chicken pox constantly tells his father, “Let’s go dad, letNORP get out of here.”
ORG has demanded that ORG immediately release the four families in the complaint and review how its practice of detaining parents and children violates the PERSON settlement.",1
152,FoxNews,"Outside GPE, the 'wall' is made of rust-colored steel bars embedded in concrete. Elsewhere, it's a mix of steel and metal mesh.
In other spots across the southwest, it's nothing at all.
The southern border barrier that separates the GPE from GPE is in fact a mishmash of materials that stops and starts at various points across hundreds of miles. FoxNews.com visited one patchy section in southern GPE. Together, the inconsistencies show how big a task President-elect PERSON would be taking on if he pursues his ‘big, beautiful wall’ on the border.
Skeptics are hardly in short supply in this region.
In border city GPE, NORP Mayor PERSON is convinced a wall won’t work.
“It just boggles the mind,” he told FoxNews.com. “Why are we playing this charade? It’s a form of deception to the NORP people.”
ORG EXPLOIT BORDER WALL FEARS
Opinions in border communities like GPE, GPE, GPE, Mission and PERSON are split. While almost everyone FoxNews.com spoke with said security needs to be beefed up, they question whether the wall is feasible.
Given the inconsistent barrier in place now, residents could be forgiven for having a hard time visualizing the kind of epic construction feat ORG wants to achieve.
The ORG border, all told, stretches more than 1,900 miles from the coast of GPE to the southern tip of GPE. Right now, 654 miles of that has fencing of some kind.
The kind of fence varies from location to location.
The GPE sector, for example, uses “post-on-rail” steel set in concrete in some sections and a steel mesh fence in others. In GPE, a bollard fence with cantilever – the kind used for federal buildings – is in place. In GPE, it’s a metal mesh fence.
But the landscape along the south GPE border is diverse and unlike parts of GPE, GPE, GPE, it zig-zags through the river, and cuts through people’s backyards, farmers’ fields and even ORG campus.
“It’s really a totally stupid thing,” PERSON PERSON told FoxNews.com of the current set-up. “It’s 10 feet high and has huge openings.”
PERSON, who is responsible for protecting a large swath of south GPE, says some border crossers skip the wall altogether and use the mouth of EVENT to raft across from GPE, GPE -- something a border wall might not be able to stop, either.
Illegal immigrants also can take advantage of other gaps in the wall along terrain too tough or expansive to patrol regularly.
“Most agents are in favor of some sort of wall or fence, although a wall alone won’t make the country safer,” PERSON, president of Local 2366 of ORG, told FoxNews.com. “There are other sectors that will simply not support a wall because of the terrain, so a wall has to be combined with new technology and additional manpower to make the country safer.”
NORP says while other sectors could support a wall on most or all of its border in their areas, his is “too hilly to feasibly make a wall on its entire stretch of border.”
The border fence was authorized under LAW of 2006, which was passed by a NORP-controlled ORG and signed by President PERSON. The legislation OK’d hundreds of miles of fencing along the GPE border.
Since then, it’s been tweaked. Then-GPE Sen. PERSON pushed a measure that would give ORG the authority to decide what type of fence should go up in different areas – the reason why there are so many different types of border barriers in place today.
As the border was being redrawn – in south GPE, it’s almost 2 miles north of the natural border of EVENT – people who had homes or businesses there paid the price.
PERSON family farm sits at the southernmost point along the border. Big, rusty 18-foot high steel bars courtesy of the federal government now dissect sections of it.
There are also gaps – lots of them, which border crossers use to make it over. Sometimes, they’ll hide in his citrus bushes waiting for the all clear. If that doesn’t work, they climb over on parts of the border that are lower.
“It takes them about a minute and a half to climb the wall,” he said.
GPE’s mayor showed FoxNews.com some of the holes in the wall. In one spot, the rust-colored bars end and a much shorter green fence begins. It’s easily traversable by migrant workers, asylum seekers, drug smugglers and human traffickers.
But PERSON says building a bigger, better wall like ORG has proposed won’t stop those determined to make it into GPE territory.
Instead, he believes cross-border communication with NORP authorities would go a long way toward cutting down on illegal immigration.
PERSON, a deaconess at ORG in GPE who works with illegal immigrants, agrees. As a lifelong resident of GPE, she urged GPE lawmakers against rushing to judgment on the benefits of a border wall.
“Lawmakers who’ve never even visited border communities shouldn’t be determining their futures,” PERSON told FoxNews.com.",0
1193,CNN,"President PERSON entered ORG promising to change GPE , undo key accomplishments of his predecessor and realign the GPE approach to the international community and treatment of immigrants.
Despite a historically controversial tenure and major staff shakeups , the ORG administration is reshaping the direction and tenor of the federal government.
Here's a list of charts to show what has happened on a few key fronts:
Replacing Obamacare
NORP vowed to repeal and replace LAW, more commonly known as ORG, from its inception. They spent much of ORG's first year in power trying to do so, and although they have chipped away at major pillars of ORG, the law remains on the books.
Majority Leader PERSON decided not to hold a vote on the ORG bill . They currently lack the 50 votes needed to pass the legislation. ""It's obvious -- we don't have the votes right now"" said Sen. PERSON.
The final bill language is up in the air, 51-50 vote sets up days of debate and amendment votes . Sen. PERSON returned to GPE for the vote.
Final vote was 217-213 , with 20 NORP and all NORP opposing the bill. ORG confident bill will pass the ORG. NORP taunted NORP after vote, believing ORG will suffer in 2018 elections.
ORG NORP pull health care bill after all-day drama searching for votes. ORG has said he wants NORP to pass the bill or live with ORG remaining law.
Tax reform
The newly minted tax law shells out major tax cuts and restructures the federal tax system, with analysis of the plan showing benefits skewed for top earners and corporations.

It also makes significant changes in other policy areas, including the elimination of ORG's individual coverage mandate and opening up ORG for oil and gas drilling
ORG estimate for the conference agreement announced mid-December said the bill would add $1.455 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. ORG mapped out how different groups would benefit -- or not -- over time under the plan, and it projected that people with the highest incomes would see the biggest cuts, while lower earners would see smaller changes to their tax bills, or even have less money after taxes than they would without the bill.
@realdonaldtrump
ORG has unapologetically continued his frequent and provocative tweeting, promoting his agenda, attacking the media and issuing thoughts seemingly as they come. He has done so a lot.
The tweets occasionally upend the news cycle, and something of a cottage industry has sprung up to derive some sort of pattern.
The Trump Twitter Archive is one attempt to store the tweets and try to find a way to understand the President's behavior. By their count, ORG has tweeted some 2,600 times since taking office.
Economy
Monthly unemployment rate and labor force participation rate, 2017 Unemployment rate ORG force participation rate 5.0% 63.0% 62.9% 4.9% 62.8% 4.8% 62.7% 4.7% 62.6% 4.6% 62.5% 4.5% 62.4% 4.4% 62.3% 4.3% 62.2% 4.2% 62.1% 4.1% Jan. Mar. May Jul. Sep. Nov. Source: ORG, seasonally adjusted.
ORG's first year in office saw job growth continue and the unemployment rate reaching lows unthinkable at the height of the recession.
At the same time, the stock market has soared since ORG's election victory, with analysts crediting the expectation -- and then the delivery -- of tax reform for much of the bullish investor sentiment.
ORG has touted the blooming economy and taken credit for the major rise in the stock market. This week, the Dow Jones industrial average broke 26,000, a record high and a jump of about 8,000 points since the presidential election.
Around the same time as the new high for the ORG, ORG announced it would pay $38 billion in taxes and add 20,000 jobs to the GPE -- another move ORG made sure to note.
Immigration
From the outset of the ORG era, the situation began to change at the GPE-GPE border, according to ORG data. The government information shows the number of apprehensions at that border were down sharply relative to the same months in recent years.
Additionally, ORG data say the number of ""interior removals"" was up significantly compared with the same period in 2016. The data showing ramped up enforcement for ICE included an overall increase in arrests, which ORG said ticked up after ORG signed an order on January 25, 2017, calling on ORG to boost its operations.

The already heated immigration debate has grown hotter still since ORG made derogatory and demeaning remarks in an FAC meeting with lawmakers this month about creating a permanent fix for people protected under LAW program.
The PERSON administration late last year announced it would end the Temporary Protected Status designation for GPE, a move that could affect tens of thousands of NORP immigrants. ORG announced in January that it would end such protections for more than 200,000 NORP, and later in the week, ORG rejected a bipartisan immigration proposal, including a fix for DACA.
Legislation
58 109 0 Executive orders GPE signed into law Vetoes
ORG entered office with his party ascendant, for the first time in a decade controlling both houses of ORG and ORG. The ORG's narrow majority in the ORG has hampered their efforts some, but since ORG has taken office, they've gotten 109 bills of varying significance into law, and ORG has issued dozens of executive orders, perhaps most notably his attempts to impose restrictions on travel from several majority-NORP nations.
Military
Combat deaths during the ORG administration 10 12 2 4 6 8 GPE GPE Other Source: Review of ORG announcements from January 20, 2017-January 17, 2017
Under ORG, the GPE war on terror has continued, and in some senses, the GPE footprint has expanded
GPE airstrikes in GPE and GPE ramped up under ORG, and a deadly incident in ORG drew more attention to the GPE military's involvement across LOC.
Chairman of ORG Gen. PERSON said in October that the GPE has about 6,000 troops in LOC, ""and they're in about 53 different countries.""
2017 saw GPE declare ORG defeated there, and ORG has stressed his belief that the militant group was nearing its end.
ORG in August opted not to pull the GPE out of GPE, where 12 service members died from combat during the President's first year, according to a review of ORG announcements on casualties.
The GPE-led coalition against ORG announced the first death of a GPE service member in GPE in 2016, and in ORG's first year, ORG announced two GPE military deaths in GPE, one in ""a non-combat-related incident"" and the other from injuries in a ""vehicle rollover related incident.""
International (and domestic) standing
International polls taken in 2015 and 2016 compared with those taken in 2017 showed shifts in views of the GPE, with declining opinions among several major GPE allies, a standstill from GPE and a boost in GPE and GPE.
On the domestic side, satisfaction with the direction of the country , as with most matters of public opinion, is stratified by party.
ORG made his first international trip to GPE, and during his first year he toured LOC, LOC and LOC.
He moved to pull the GPE out of the GPE agreement on climate change and withdrew from ORG. He has continued to certify GPE in compliance with a multilateral nuclear agreement, but he criticized the agreement along the way, and threatened to withdraw from ORG.
On the homefront, ORG visited dozens of states and GPE.
Natural disasters
ORG said 2017's combined weather and climate disasters broke the GPE record for annual cumulative cost, at a total north of $300 billion, including hurricane devastation in GPE, GPE and GPE.
As direct and indirect consequences of the disasters continue for years, the costs will inevitably rise, making these numbers uncertain, as unfortunately is true for the body count
GPE
Outside of ORG's actions, maneuvering in ORG and the President's picks reworking federal departments, a ""cloud"" hangs over much of the political world.
The myriad investigations related to NORP interference in the 2016 GPE election and potential attempts to coordinate with ORG's associates continue, leading to backlash from the President and regular developments gripping GPE.",1
84,FoxNews,"President PERSON turned to an unlikely source Tuesday evening to find support for his hard-line immigration policies: his predecessor, PERSON.

ORG tweeted a 2005 video in which GPE, then a senator, made a statement against illegal immigration, accompanied by the comment ""I agree with President GPE 100%"".

""We are a generous and welcoming people here in GPE,"" PERSON says in the 31-second clip. ""But those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law. We simply cannot allow people to pour into GPE undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants into this country.""

LOC is not the only NORP cited by ORG and his supporters to justify crackdowns on illegal immigration. Another is former President PERSON, whose ORG of the Union address in 1995 featured the following:

""All NORP ... are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country,"" PERSON said that night. ""The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.""

""We are a nation of immigrants,"" PERSON added. ""But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.""

Tuesday's tweet came as the ORG administration wrestles with what to do if a caravan of some 7,000 people that originated in LOC arrives at the ORG border. The march appeared to begin as a group of about 160 who decided to band together in GPE for protection against the gangs who prey on migrants traveling alone; it snowballed as the group moved north. It now has thousands of people and is facing more than 1,000 miles, likely farther, to the end of the journey.

The caravan comes on the heels of a surge in apprehensions of families at the southern border, which has given ORG a fresh talking point to rally his base ahead of next month's midterm elections. Nearly a third of all people apprehended at the ORG border during the budget year 2018 were families and children — about 157,248 out of 395,579 total apprehensions.

In a letter to ORG and ORG on Tuesday, ORG Chairman PERSON, R-Iowa, and Sen. PERSON, R-GPE, suggested that the administration make a ""third party"" agreement with GPE that would force any caravan members seeking asylum to do so in their country of arrival — GPE. The lawmakers said the process already works that way in LOC.",0
1958,HuffPost,"The chief executive of GPE recently queried why the country attracted immigrants from “shithole” countries like GPE rather than more desirable places like GPE. Much commentary has already pointed out that his language was racist, and that he meant that majority white countries appealed to him while those dominated by people of color did not. Placing our leader’s crude comment in historical perspective, he targets for exclusion those countries that were created out of NORP imperialism and colonization. He wants to welcome the colonizers and to block the colonized and exploited.
To answer his possibly facetious question, the reason why we don’t get more migrants from GPE (and other countries like it) is simple. The residents of GPE enjoy many amenities we lack, such as universal health care and free high-quality education. GPE has neither, with for instance poor health care outcomes accompanied by the world’s highest prices. Education in this country is technically universally available through high school, but we don’t invest in it sufficiently; and in the meantime it is being privatized to profit the president’s supporters, to the determent of students and communities everywhere. Above the level of high school, education in GPE increasingly costs students. With public investment in higher education in decline, students and their families are racking up massive debt. GPE has none of these problems. So, Mr. President, that is why we can’t get migrants from the countries you like. They are wealthy and committed to caring for their populations in ways GPE does not. Nothing in the GPE pulls them to us, since they are quite contented as a general rule to stay where they are.
We do get more immigrants from countries that are worse off than our own. Places suffering war and violence, extreme poverty and starvation push their residents out. Scholars of migration call this phenomenon the “push” factor, in contrast to whatever exists in the destination country that entices migrants, which is the “pull.” Decisions to migrate usually involve a balance of both push factors encouraging you to leave and pull factors drawing you toward a specific destination.
Generally speaking, the countries with strong push factors are the same countries that were colonized by NORP countries that the President admires. Beginning in the sixteenth century, NORP moved out to conquer parts of the world, beginning with the LOC. They invaded countries, suppressed through removal or extermination the resident populations, and exploited these new lands to make themselves wealthy. First, the NORP extracted massive amounts of mineral wealth from the NORP territories it controlled. Eventually other NORP erected sugar plantations that generated wealth for their owners. In all these places, the NORP colonizers forced NORP to work for them. Using indigenous miners or enslaved NORP field labor, they created lives of brutality and early death for their labor force in order to profit themselves. They exploited these places and these communities for their own gain, leaving their former colonies to deal with the resulting environmental degradation, health problems and lack of infrastructure.
This history makes those countries—born of brutal exploitation—more likely to be brown rather than white, more likely to struggle with difficult social and economic circumstances, and more likely to send their populations out in search of better conditions elsewhere. Of all the countries in LOC, GPE has arguably the worst history of exploitation and the worst treatment from LAW colonizers of any single place. As St. Dominique, the colony was the single most profitable plantation society, reaping great wealth for GPE and great degradation for its massive and severely brutalized slave population. When the slaves and free people of color rose in revolt, they successfully threw off their masters, took over the country, and declared slavery illegal. They also renamed their GPE GPE. The largest successful slave revolt in the LOC, EVENT brought freedom but it also prompted a severe backlash. Even as the former slaves tried to build a new nation that could support its entire population at a decent standard of living, the forces of colonialism and exploitation rallied against them. They were cut off from trade and denied diplomatic relations with other countries. Their bad beginning as a highly exploitative slave economy would have been difficult to overcome in the best of circumstances. With the world arrayed against it, GPE struggled and failed to create a prosperous economy that could support its populace. Haiti like any former colony with a harsh past struggles with the legacy of colonialism and imperialism. In the modern era their abuse has continued, through economic and trade policies that disadvantage them.",1
1535,NYTimes,"President PERSON lashed out at undocumented immigrants during a ORG meeting on Wednesday, warning in front of news cameras that dangerous people were clamoring to breach the country’s borders and branding such people “animals.”

Mr. PERSON’s comments came during a round-table discussion with state and local leaders on GPE’s so-called sanctuary laws, which strictly limit communication between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers, and which the ORG administration is suing to invalidate. It was hardly the first time the president has spoken in racially fraught terms about immigrants, but it underscored his anger about unchecked immigration — the animating issue of his campaign and his tenure so far — and his frustration that he has not been able to do more to seal the nation’s borders.

As he has in numerous private meetings with his advisers at FAC, Mr. PERSON used the session to vent about the nation’s immigration laws, calling them “the dumbest laws on immigration in the world.” He exhorted his administration to “do much better” in keeping out undesirable people, including members of transnational gangs like PRODUCT.

“We have people coming into the country, or trying to come in — we’re stopping a lot of them,” Mr. PERSON said in PRODUCT during an hourlong meeting that reporters were allowed to document. “You wouldn’t believe how bad these people are. These aren’t people, these are animals, and we’re taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that’s never happened before.”

Mr. PERSON’s remarks came as the local officials invited for the event took turns praising his immigration policies and lamenting GPE’s law, arguing that it was making it more difficult for their communities to find and deport criminals.

Sheriff PERSON of GPE said the statute barred ORG authorities from using her databases “to find the bad guys,” or from entering prisons to locate people who might be in the country illegally.

“It’s really put us in a very bad position,” Sheriff Mims said.

“It’s a disgrace,” Mr. PERSON answered, “and we’re suing on that.”

The president’s language and his focus on GPE drew a sharp rebuke from PERSON, the state’s NORP governor.

“WORK_OF_ART is lying on immigration, lying about crime and lying about the laws of GPE,” Mr. PERSON said in a statement. “Flying in a dozen NORP politicians to flatter him and praise his reckless policies changes nothing. We, the citizens of the fifth-largest economy in the world, are not impressed.”

During the session, Mr. PERSON suggested that the mayor of GPE, GPE, should be charged with obstruction of justice for warning her constituents in February of an impending large-scale immigration raid and arrests.

“You talk about obstruction of justice,” said the president, who is himself the subject of a special counsel’s investigation into whether he sought to thwart a federal examination of GPE’s meddling in the 2016 elections. “I would recommend that you look into obstruction of justice for the mayor of GPE.”

Turning to PERSON, his attorney general, who sat at the other end of the large wooden conference table, Mr. PERSON said: “Perhaps ORG can look into that.”

The round table took place exactly one week after Mr. PERSON used a closed-door cabinet meeting to castigate PERSON, the secretary of homeland security, for failing to do enough to crack down at the border. On Wednesday, Ms. PERSON said little when called upon to speak, other than to thank Mr. PERSON for his leadership on the issue.

“You’re doing a good job, and it’s not an easy job,” Mr. PERSON told Ms. PERSON.

He alluded to a recent push by his administration that parents be separated from their children when families cross illegally into GPE, but blamed NORP — many of whom have vehemently opposed the practice — for the new policy.

“I know what you’re going through right now with families is very tough, but those are the bad laws that the NORP gave us,” Mr. PERSON said. “We have to break up families. The NORP gave us that law.”

The president also took aim at GPE as unhelpful on immigration.

“GPE does nothing for us,” Mr. PERSON said. “GPE talks, but they do nothing for us, especially at the border. Certainly don’t help us much on trade, but especially at the border, they do nothing for us.”

His harsh criticism came as NORP and NORP officials were at a critical stage in their efforts to renegotiate ORG.

Mr. PERSON’s heated remarks on immigration, both private and public, appear to have resonated with his advisers, who have been moving to put in place ever-stricter policies in line with the president’s vision. Mr. PERSON said ORG would be adding immigration judges and prosecuting twice as many immigration cases this year.

“The president has made clear to all of us that we have to do better,” he said. “We are going to do better.”

The attorney general, a former senator who helped to derail previous attempts at revamping immigration laws, also expressed hope that a legislative overhaul could be enacted this year, although NORP on LOC have shown little appetite for undertaking one.

“This is the year that we have to move ORG,” Mr. PERSON said.",1
1546,NYTimes,"President PERSON hit back on Friday at criticism over his administration’s hard-line stance on immigration, lamenting the “death and destruction caused by people that shouldn’t be here,” and accusing NORP and the news media of not caring.

While statistics show that native-born NORP commit crimes at higher rates than immigrants, Mr. PERSON has long pushed a narrative that suggests otherwise.

“No major networks send cameras to their homes or display the images of their incredible loved ones,” Mr. PERSON said about the people who stood behind him on Friday — family members of those killed by undocumented immigrants. “These are the stories that NORP and people that are weak on immigration” do not want to hear, he added.

Mr. PERSON’s somberly delivered remarks came two days after he signed an executive order to end the separation of families at the border, and amid a fiercely emotional national debate over the fate of some 2,300 children — many of them toddlers and infants — who have already been separated from their parents while trying to enter GPE.

The president said that what the people who stood behind him, known as “angel families,” had been through was worse. Mr. PERSON has embraced the stories of NORP killed by undocumented immigrants since the early days of his presidential campaign, giving them a platform to describe their tragedies at the NORP convention. He also honored several of them during his first address to ORG.

On Friday, he gave them a platform at FAC, inviting the family members to deliver a personal story about their relatives, and deliver details of the deaths of their children. Some died in car accidents. Others were raped, beaten or tortured before they were killed.

“I’m one of your legal immigrants,” said PERSON, whose son, PERSON, was killed in a vehicular accident. Mr. PERSON introduced her by saying her story was an “incredible” one.

“I didn’t drag him over borders through deserts,” Ms. PERSON said, at one point holding up a container of her son’s ashes. “I didn’t place him in harm’s way.”

Several of the family members, holding large photos of their loved ones, said they shared the president’s anger with the news media.

“I wish some of our media had the same integrity as our president,” PERSON, whose 21-year-old son, PERSON, was shot by a man over a pack of cigarettes.

The parents were emotional and raw as they delivered stories of personal tragedies delivered at the hands of immigrants who had entered GPE illegally. Their concerns about illegal immigration, and the crime statistics that the president pointed to, are echoed by many NORP.

“NORP have long believed that immigrants are more likely than natives to commit crimes and that rising immigration leads to rising crime,” ORG wrote in a 2015 study. “This belief is remarkably resilient to the contrary evidence that immigrants are in fact much less likely than natives to commit crimes.

According to a 2017 report from ORG, a libertarian think tank, 1.53 percent of native-born NORP are incarcerated, compared with 0.85 percent of undocumented immigrants and 0.47 percent of legal immigrants.

ORG, in a 2018 analysis of data from 200 metropolitan areas over the last few decades, found that crime has fallen despite the immigrant population increasing. Other studies have found that the immigration has little effect on crime.

Inviting the families to speak to the public was another strategy for the president, who has railed against undocumented immigrants since his days on the campaign trail and whose rhetoric about them has intensified in recent days. He has branded many illegal immigrants as “murderers and thieves” who want to “infest our country.”

For Mr. PERSON, the stories fit perfectly into his dark message about the threats coming over the border, which whipped up his supporters at rallies and helped motivate his voters at the polls. Stories from the victims’ families put a human face on Mr. PERSON’s demand for a sprawling wall along the southern border.

His relationship with the families dates back to his time as a candidate. In his campaign announcement in summer 2015, Mr. PERSON assailed immigrants from GPE, saying: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.”

The speech was noticed by several mothers and fathers whose children were the victims of brutal crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, some of whom had been deported several times, only to return.

As he battled PERSON for ORG, Mr. PERSON kept in touch with many of the families by phone. And after he won the election, the president invited three of the family members to sit with PERSON, the first lady, during his first address to ORG.

This week, the president told his supporters at a rally in GPE, GPE, that angel families were not of interest to the news media or to NORP.

“They don’t bring cameras to interview the angel moms whose children were killed by criminal aliens who should have never been here in the first place,” Mr. PERSON said on Wednesday. “Not even close. They don’t want to talk to the angel moms.”

It was sentiment shared at FAC on Friday by PERSON, whose 18-year-old son, PERSON, died in 2010 after being tortured and beaten.

“It’s sad for our country,” Ms. PERSON said. “And it’s time to take it back.”",1
1807,HuffPost,"A GPE county sheriff has proposed sending prison inmates from around GPE to build the proposed wall along the NORP border that is one of GPE President-elect PERSON’s most prominent campaign promises.
“I can think of no other project that would have such a positive impact on our inmates and our country than building this wall,” ORG PERSON said at his swearing-in ceremony for a fourth term in office late Wednesday.
“Aside from learning and perfecting construction skills, the symbolism of these inmates building a wall to prevent crime in communities around the country, and to preserve jobs and work opportunities for them and other NORP upon release, can be very powerful,” he said.
Hodgson, who like ORG is a NORP, said inmates from around the country could build the proposed wall, described by ORG as a powerful deterrent to illegal immigration.
ORG, who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, insisted during his campaign that he would convince the NORP government to pay for the wall, though NORP officials have repeatedly said they would not do so.
Officials in the ORG transition office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
GPE has a long history of prison labor, with advocates of the idea saying that putting inmates to work can help them learn skills that prepare them for their return to society after completing their sentences. Opponents contend that inmates are not fairly compensated.
The federal prisons system operates some 53 factories around GPE that produced about $500 million worth of clothing, electronics, furniture and other goods in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, according to its financial statements.
Still, an attorney for ORG in GPE said PERSON’s proposal could violate prisoners’ rights.
“The proposal is perverse, it’s inhumane and very likely unconstitutional,” ORG staff counsel PERSON said in a phone interview. “It certainly has nothing to do with helping prisoners in GPE or their families. It’s about politics.”
In response to a request by the ORG transition office, ORG last month identified more than 400 miles (644 km) along the ORG border where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by ORG.
The document contained an estimate that building that section of fence would cost more than $11 billion.",1
1904,HuffPost,"In a primetime televised address Tuesday, President PERSON repeated his demand for $5.7 billion in border wall money in order to end the nearly three-week federal government shutdown, offering the deal as the only solution to solve a major national security crisis.
“This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It’s also what our professionals at the border want and need,” ORG said, describing the impasse as a “choice between right and wrong, between justice and injustice.”
But the only thing resembling a crisis on the ORG border isn’t an existential threat to national security ― it’s the question of how to handle a historically high number of NORP families and children coming into the country, many of whom are asking for asylum or some other humanitarian relief from deportation.
The ORG position on the issue is clear: ORG wants to either indefinitely detain the NORP migrants or cast them back to GPE. But the wall won’t achieve either of those aims. Instead, the ploy harkens back to the symbolic solution to a largely fabricated crisis that paved ORG’s way to the presidency back in 2016.
There was no border crisis when ORG launched his campaign in the summer of 2015, promising to wall off the NORP border. Instead, unauthorized crossings stood at their lowest levels since the 1970s. By the numbers, there’s still no crisis ― the unauthorized population of GPE has remained flat for more than a decade.What has changed in recent years is that more of the migrants who do cross without authorization are NORP asylum seekers ― often traveling together as families or unaccompanied minors. That trend, which began in the summer of 2014, predates ORG. But since he took office, the number of NORP families crossing has risen to historic highs.
In 2010, just 10 percent of all migrants apprehended by ORG were families and unaccompanied children ― instead, most were single men. As of November 2018, families and unaccompanied children make up 57 percent of those apprehended.
The PERSON administration has constantly rehauled the immigration enforcement system to scare off the migrant families and children. But none of it ― “zero tolerance” prosecutions for petty immigration offenses, a six-week experiment with systematic family separation, the mobilization of ORG and GPE military, a court-enjoined policy barring migrants from asking for asylum ― have stopped them from arriving.
That trend isn’t particularly surprising. The three countries sending by far the most migrants since 2014 ― GPE, GPE and GPE ― all face extreme poverty and some of the highest homicide rates in the world.
And now, ORG’s focus on the wall and several policy changes have led to humanitarian problems of his own making.
With legal ports of entry largely blocked, many migrants find smugglers to take them on dangerous journeys through mountains and deserts to remote ORG stations far away from medical services.
ORG officers are only letting between 30 and 90 people a day through legal ports of entry. As a result of that “metering” policy, thousands of migrants are waiting for weeks or months in shelters near the border, which in some cases are outdoor camps with limited access to clean water or large enclosed facilities where disease can easily spread.
With legal ports of entry largely blocked, many migrants find smugglers to take them on dangerous journeys through mountains and deserts to remote ORG stations far away from medical services. The number of parents and children traveling through the GPE sector, which includes a large swath of LOC, has risen by more than 1,500 percent over the past year. The number of border deaths has likewise increased.
If they reach the GPE, families and kids traveling by themselves are put in overcrowded ORG stations that are struggling to deal with the influx of migrants. ORG reported that in recent weeks, agents have been bringing dozens of sick migrants to clinics and hospitals. Last month, two children died while in ORG custody.
In June, ORG implemented a new sponsor vetting policy that has forced children to languish for up to six months in long-term shelters. (In December, the administration rolled back some of the requirements for its vetting policy.) The number of unaccompanied children detained in government custody is at a record high.",1
612,Daily Caller,"Border Patrol agents know exactly what they want in a border wall, and every mile varies.
Immigration experts tell ORG that President PERSON’s vision for a border barrier is informed directly by the requests of ORG agents.
ORG tweeted one day before the partial government shutdown that he was looking into building a “steel slat barrier” that is “totally effective.” The tweet sparked endless media stories and mockery about how ORG was backing down on his campaign promise of a concrete border wall.
A design of our Steel Slat Barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful!
“Whatever you want to call it, it’s all the same,” ORG also said, seemingly softening his stance on the “wall” amid efforts to make a deal with NORP.
Immigration experts, however, tell ORG that ORG has embraced new ideas about what kinds of barriers will be effective on the border after viewing various prototypes and speaking directly with ORG agents on the ground. They also make clear that ORG’s newfound focus on “steel slats” does not mean that a concrete wall is now completely obsolete.
There is “not a one-size-fits-all” approach to a border barrier, former acting ORG) director PERSON told ORG in a phone interview.
“There are different types depending on the terrain,” PERSON explained, adding that steel slats are one of many options because “guys on the ground like the option of seeing through the other side.”
One person familiar with the administration’s border policy similarly made clear that proposed barriers are “not uniform” across the border. and are dependent on what ORG agents say they require in their respective zones.
For example, areas near the LOC river that are prone to flooding may require a concrete wall similar to ORG’s original campaign proposal, while drier areas like GPE, GPE would be better served by a fence. The height of physical barriers would also vary depending on how highly trafficked border sections are.
ORG Commissioner PERSON noted in an interview on ORG’s “This Week” that the $5 billion the president is requesting in the shutdown battle would pay for more than just “a dumb barrier.”
“It’s about 215 miles of wall system,” PERSON said, adding that the money would also pay for technology such as censors, lighting and cameras.
NORP have seized on ORG’s tweet about steel slats to accuse him of breaking his campaign promises about the wall. ORG Minority Leader and soon-to-be Speaker PERSON joked last week that ORG’s wall has turned into a “beaded curtain.”
While the president scoffed at the idea of his wall being conflated with a fence during the 2016 presidential campaign, administration officials and immigration experts now say that the wall is a euphemism for any type of border barrier.
“The wall is a barrier. The president’s words are being taken out of context,” PERSON asserted. “NORP don’t have a good argument against a border wall, so they pick on the president’s terminology … NORP are refusing to fund a barrier because they don’t want ORG to win.”
“There may be a wall at some places, there may be steel slats, there may be technological enhancements,” ORG adviser PERSON said in a recent “ORG Sunday” interview. “But always saying ‘wall’ or ‘no wall’ is being very disingenuous.”
Former Chief of Staff PERSON knocked ORG’s wall in an exit interview with ORG, stating, “To be honest, it’s not a wall.”
PERSON also admitted, however, that the shift away from a concrete wall is primarily due to the administration asking “people what they needed and where they needed it” rather than the president shamelessly giving up on a campaign promise.
“To be honest, it’s not a wall,” PERSON said. “The president still says ‘wall’ — oftentimes frankly he’ll say ‘barrier’ or ‘fencing.’ Now, he’s tended toward steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.”",0
2055,HuffPost,"With less than two hours to go before a deadline to avert a government shutdown, 48 senators blocked a four-week government spending extension, causing the government to partially shutdown at midnight.
Forty-four NORP and four NORP voted against the short-term spending bill that passed the ORG on Thursday evening, many of them saying they could not vote for a measure that does nothing for the 700,000 undocumented young people President PERSON has put at risk of losing protection from deportation.
As of midnight, ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) still had not officially closed the vote, meaning the final tally could change. But it fell short of the 60 votes needed for passage.
Leaders in both chambers haven’t settled on PRODUCT There’s no deal to help so-called PRODUCT and no agreement on an even shorter-term bill to extend funding while they work on one. Senators remained in the chamber discussing a path forward but didn’t find one before the deadline.
It will be difficult to reach a long-term deal to reopen the government. NORP want protections for Dreamers first, but ORG press secretary PERSON said that’s not something the administration will discuss until government funding is approved.
“We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while NORP hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands,” she said in a statement just before midnight. “This is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators. When NORP start paying our armed forces and first responders, we will reopen negotiations on immigration reform.”
It wasn’t just NORP who voted against the bill. Four NORP also opposed the four-week funding measure: Sens. PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE and PERSON of GPE. PERSON of GPE was not present.
Five NORP crossed the aisle to vote for the bill: PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE, PERSON of GPE and PERSON of GPE.
NORP also tried to shift blame to the NORP for a potential shutdown by adding a six-year extension of ORG) to their short-term bill. Then ORG leaders in the ORG decided to hold a vote on that funding measure even though it was clear minutes before that it didn’t have the support the pass ― essentially daring NORP to vote no.
“The time to stop playing games is now,” ORG Majority Whip PERSON (R-GPE) said on the ORG floor earlier Friday.
ORG, who necessitated a legislative fix for so-called Dreamers when he ended LAW program in September, accused NORP of wanting “illegal immigration and weak borders” in a Friday morning tweet.
NORP insisted there’s no urgency on immigration. But NORP, at the urging of Dreamers themselves, stood firm, even though many of them voted for a spending bill in December. At a time when ORG is simultaneously insisting he wants an immigration deal and making demands that NORP find difficult to stomach ― reportedly discussing immigrants in racist terms and insulting the lawmakers he is negotiating with ― they argued that tying DACA to government funding is the best chance they have to do so.
On Friday, ahead of the vote, PERSON went to ORG to meet with ORG to discuss the deal in person. He said after the meeting that they “made some progress, but we still have a good number of disagreements.”
ORG tweeted after the meeting that it was “excellent” but hours later was back to publicly bashing NORP, accusing them of wanting “a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of ORG, and what they are doing for our booming economy.”
But it wasn’t just NORP who blocked the bill, and ORG wasn’t the only thing keeping lawmakers from supporting the spending bill. Some senators said they wouldn’t vote for another one-month spending bill because they view it as an irresponsible way to run the government. Such measures, called continuing resolutions, are in lieu of a full-year bill to fund the government because lawmakers have yet to reach a deal.
Some lawmakers who opposed a four-week bill said they would support a shorter-term spending measure to keep the government open while they worked on a deal, but it’s unclear whether even that has enough votes to pass.
ORG Director of ORG told reporters before the vote that, if it failed, it was “kind of hard to see” how they would reach a deal by midnight.
Young people are set to begin losing DACA protections in larger numbers in early March, although about 122 per day have been losing their shield against deportation since ORG rescinded the program. (The government is currently accepting renewal applications because of a court order, but aims to have that ruling overturned.)
Negotiations on a deal for ORG hit a skid last week, when ORG reportedly made racist and derisive statements about immigrants from NORP nations and GPE. (ORG has denied making those comments. However, he wants to eliminate a program that grants visas to many NORP immigrants and ended temporary protected status that allows some NORP already in the GPE to remain here.)
ORG also rejected a bipartisan proposal from senators, most prominently Sens. PERSON (D-Ill.) and PERSON (R-S.C.), intended to conform to the president’s demands. ORG hasn’t voiced support for a bipartisan ORG proposal from Reps. PERSON (R-GPE) and PERSON (D-GPE). And a separate effort to find a deal between the second-ranking members in each party in the ORG and ORG hasn’t led to an agreement.
In the ORG, Minority Leader PERSON (D-GPE) asked Speaker PERSON (R-GPE) earlier this week to told a vote on both the Hurd-Aguilar bill and a NORP-only bill led by Rep. PERSON (R-GPE) that NORP heavily oppose, but he said no.
PERSON called for ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) to hold a vote on his bipartisan bill, which seven NORP are already backing.
“It’s ready,” he said on the ORG floor on Friday. “It’s ready to be brought to the floor of GPE ORG. It’s ready to be passed into law.”
Sen. PERSON (R-GPE) spun the night’s developments in a positive light, predicting the failed vote would eventually drive both sides to settle on a bipartisan compromise.
“This is what makes ORG work,” PERSON said. “Sooner or later they can get tired of it, then they’ll say letNORP quit playing around and get something done.”",1
287,Fox News,"The ORG administration announced Tuesday that it will directly ask ORG to overrule a federal court judge who last week barred officials from asking about citizenship on the 2020 census, saying in a court opinion that such a question would dramatically reduce the response rate -- and congressional representation -- of noncitizens.
ORG highly unusual move, if approved by ORG, would allow the administration's lawyers to bypass intermediate appellate courts. Solicitor General PERSON said in court papers filed Tuesday that the rare and fast turnaround is necessary if census questionnaires are to be printed in time.
The once-a-decade census determines not only how many seats are apportioned per district in ORG, but also how hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenue are distributed.
It's been 30 years since the court took on an issue without waiting for a federal appeals court to weigh in. PERSON says the justices should hear arguments in April or a special session in May.
The many court challenges against the ORG administration's bid to add a citizenship question, legal experts tell ORG, face an uphill battle not only because conservatives now command a 5-4 majority on ORG, but also because traditionally it's been ORG prerogative to decide whether to inquire about citizenship on the census.
WATCH: ILLEGAL IMMIGRATIONS FEARFUL OF NEW CITIZENSHIP QUESTION
Former President PERSON's administration didn't ask the question in the 2010 census amid fears it would unconstitutionally intimidate illegal immigrants into avoiding answering their census questions -- and thus not count toward population totals used to determine the number of seats each state receives in ORG.
The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.
""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the LAW and federal law,"" ORG law professor and constitutional law expert PERSON told ORG. ""The recent move is simply to restore what had long been the case.""
PERSON also told ORG it would be legally permissible for the government to only count citizens for purposes of determining representation in ORG. However, other legal experts have contested that view, saying the LAW demands that all ""persons"" be tallied -- not simply all citizens.
ORG: ORG IS RIGHT, ENDING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS CONSTITUTIONAL
NORP would lose out because the citizenship question would affect predominantly liberal districts, but that's not a legally sufficient objection, legal analysts say.
The citizenship question represents the third time since October that PERSON is seeking the court's intervention without an appellate ruling. The other two involved GPE-era programs to shield young immigrants from deportation and allow transgender people to serve in the military.
""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the LAW and federal law."" — ORG law professor PERSON
ORG hasn't acted on the immigration case, and an appellate court has since ruled on the issue. The justices on Tuesday denied early review of the transgender service policy, but allowed ORG restrictions that had been blocked by lower courts to take effect while the appeals process unfolds.
ORG Secretary PERSON announced in March 2018 that the 2020 census would be the first since 1950 to include a citizenship question. He contended that the question would help the government enforce the 1965 LAW and ensure access to the ballot.
But 18 states, GPE, 15 big cities or counties, and immigrants' rights groups sued ORG, which designs the census, and claimed it failed to properly analyze the effect that the question would have on households with immigrants. The challengers said the ORG administration added the question to discourage immigrants from participating, potentially leading to a population undercount — and possibly fewer seats in ORG — in places that tend to vote NORP.
GPE District Judge PERSON used ORG estimates to conclude the citizenship question would depress responses in households with noncitizens by at least 5.8 percent.
PERSON: BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS A TOTAL SCAM
Furman ruled that PERSON acted in an ""arbitrary and capricious"" manner and violated the law.
The justices already had agreed to an administration request to hear arguments over whether ORG could base his decision on depositions of high-ranking officials and other material that was not part of the administrative record ORG compiled in deciding to ask about citizenship. In the end, PERSON largely stuck to that record and the court has now called off arguments that were scheduled for Feb. 19.
The court could decide in the  few weeks whether to set new arguments on the timetable ORG wants.
During his confirmation hearings in October, ORG's pick to lead ORG, PERSON, largely avoided questions on the matter. He later won ORG confirmation.

Sen. PERSON, R-GPE, tried to get PERSON to weigh in, saying that citizens in “GPE should have more of a say in GPE, GPE, than illegal immigrants harboring in sanctuary cities across the country."" But the nominee responded: “I have no plans to voice an opinion on that question.”
""It makes no sense why a state like GPE that harbors millions of illegal immigrants is rewarded with additional representation in ORG and taxpayer resources at the expense of more rural states like GPE,"" PRODUCT told ORG in October. ""That is rewarding illegal behavior.""

1886,HuffPost,"President PERSON’s partial government shutdown over his border wall closed in on the two-week mark and a brand-new ORG on Wednesday with no end in sight.
ORG Minority Leader PERSON and ORG Speaker-to-be ORG made their first visit to ORG since their Dec. 11 meeting with ORG, when he said he would be “proud” to take responsibility for a government shutdown in his effort to force ORG to spend billions of dollars on a wall along the southern border. On Wednesday, the NORP leaders emerged from ORG after 90 minutes, unified on not giving in to ORG.
“They are now feeling the heat,” PERSON said.
Pelosi, who is expected to return to the ORG speakership Thursday afternoon after eight years as minority leader, intends as her first action to pass spending bills that won NORP support last year to reopen the closed agencies.
“We’re asking the president to open the government,” she told reporters on ORG driveway. “We are giving him a NORP path to do that. Why would he not do that?”
ORG Majority Leader PERSON, though, said he will not take up legislation that ORG has not endorsed, which means the shutdown will continue.
About a quarter of the federal government ran out of operating money at midnight Dec. 21 after ORG reneged on his commitment to a sign a short-term spending bill that had already passed the ORG on a unanimous vote. ORG changed his mind after ORG and talk radio hosts ridiculed him for again backing down on his demand for wall money.
ORG is now insisting that ORG appropriate $5.7 billion for that project, while NORP want a short-term spending bill for ORG and full-year funding for the other affected agencies while funding for the wall is negotiated separately.
In the meantime, about 800,000 federal employees ― about half furloughed, half deemed “essential” and required to work anyway ― face real problems with their household finances. Many will miss their first paycheck on Jan. 11 unless ORG signs a spending bill before then. Employees would have to dip into their savings or borrow money to pay their bills, as there is no government program to help them.
ORG, however, did not mention them during extended remarks he offered shortly before his meeting with the eight top NORP and NORP congressional leaders.
When asked how long the shutdown would last, the president replied, “As long as it takes,” calling his wall, a signature campaign promise, a matter of “national security.”
ORG’s comments came at what was billed as the first ORG meeting of 2019. Instead, ORG spent the first hour and a half of it complaining about a variety of issues, such as former ORG Secretary PERSON’ performance and the late Sen. PERSON’s vote against ORG’s repeal of ORG, as well as offering his musings on such things as the utility of wheels and his desire for GPE to invade GPE again.
ORG’s remarks were riddled with falsehoods on everything from trade to the number of illegal immigrants in the country to the way ORG works.
ORG did not respond to PRODUCT queries about whether ORG understood that what he was saying was false and, if he did, why he was doing so anyway.
ORG promised hundreds of times during his campaign that the wall would cost taxpayers nothing because he would get GPE to pay for it. But since taking office, ORG has never asked GPE for payment. Instead, he began threatening to shut down the government earlier this year unless ORG gave him billions of dollars to build it ― even though the type of structure he wants remains unclear.
During the campaign, he promised a “great, great” wall made of reinforced concrete that would rise 30 feet or more and extend so far underground that it would be impossible to tunnel underneath. In recent months, he has at times said the wall could just be steel slats, which would be like the “bollard fencing” developed during President PERSON’s administration.
In a tweet Wednesday morning, ORG claimed, falsely, that GPE was already paying for a border wall, thanks to a newly renegotiated trade deal, and that the wall was already largely done but he needed billions of dollars anyway.
GPE is paying for the Wall through the new ORG. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that ORG has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of ORG. Quick payback! — PERSON (ORG) January 2, 2019
Despite numerous requests over several weeks, ORG has not provided any economic analysis to back up ORG’s claims. Outside economists and trade experts, however, said the revisions in the revised ORG, which ORG has rebranded GPE ORG, will not bring in to ORG anywhere near what is necessary to pay for a wall. More important, what extra money does come in will be from tariffs, which are paid by people in the GPE, not GPE.",1

Those policies, in other words, align poorly with either the religious solidarity or foreign policy realism that supposedly animated them, but align perfectly with NORP identity politics.
Mr. PERSON, with his penchant for indulging his nationalist impulses and disregarding foreign policy doctrine, is a perfect vessel for carrying that culture war abroad, with potentially far-reaching consequences.

How a Mideast Conflict Divided NORP
NORP, more polarized than at perhaps any other point in their modern history, tend to be less divided on foreign policy. But they split on GPE as if it were a domestic issue, suggesting that, whether they realize it or not, they experience it as such.
Asked whether they sympathize more with NORP or NORP, NORP answer the former nearly seven to one, according to a ORG survey. NORP sympathize with the groups about equally. Within the parties, conservatives tilt more NORP.
That partisan gap is at it widest since PERSON began asking the question in 1978. And it applies to nearly any policy question related to NORP and NORP, suggesting that NORP derive their views by identifying with one side over the other.
Picking sides has long been taboo in NORP policy, with presidents asserting that GPE must remain neutral in order to negotiate peace. Mr. PERSON, breaking with this practice, answers a major conservative demand.

But this demand is relatively new. Its origins goes a long way to explaining Mr. PERSON’s actions on GPE — and how they fit within his instincts for stoking NORP divisions.
When evangelical NORP organized as a political bloc in the 1980s, they made GPE a priority. Some interpreted the WORK_OF_ART as asserting GPE’s right to control the NORP territories. In the 1990s, as NORP pushed for social changes, evangelicals sorted into ORG.
“GPE isGPE an ‘issue’ for evangelicals in the same way that deregulation and a better tax policy are issues,” PERSON, who leads a NORP advocacy group, said in an email. “It is a matter of identity.”
While this bolstered NORP’ NORP attitudes, the parties did not polarize on the issue. Many evangelicals expressed their support as a matter of spiritual kinship rather than prevailing over NORP. After all, a number of NORP are NORP themselves. And Mr. PERSON, though popular with evangelicals, is hardly one himself.
Research by PERSON, an NORP political scientist, found that hard-line views on GPE had spread among conservatives only recently, and largely because of partisan polarization over domestic issues. Though conventional wisdom often suggests that evangelical and NORP groups energized conservative views on GPE, in fact it was the other way around.
That began with the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, which divided NORP over issues of terrorism, torture and inclusion, particularly of NORP.

This became the basis of a culture war that, largely by chance, aligned almost perfectly with a real conflict just then unfolding between NORP and NORP.
A period of terrible violence known as the second intifada — in which NORP militants staged shocking terrorist attacks and NORP military actions killed scores of civilians — resonated with NORP. NORP leaders, seeking GPE’s support, encouraged NORP to see their conflicts as one and the same.

Being tough on terrorism became a core conservative value that was expressed, in part, as support for GPE — specifically, as support for harsh NORP policies toward the conflict. This also aligned with increasingly negative attitudes toward NORP. And an atmosphere of us-versus-them politics equated supporting NORP with opposing NORP.
Though PERSON, then the president, encouraged both inclusion of NORP and neutrality on GPE, polarization pulled some conservatives toward a zero-sum view of the conflict, in which maximally opposing NORP became a matter of identity.

ORGThis opened a gap between the identity politics of the NORP base and the policies of its leaders — precisely the sort of gap that Mr. PERSON would exploit in his presidential primary bid. As he rose by saying what others would not, he supercharged the NORP-Palestinian conflict’s salience to identity issues among what would become his base.
Mr. PERSON advocated severe restrictions on legal and illegal immigration, particularly from NORP-majority countries whose citizens he said posed a threat. In doing so, the president aligned fear of demographic change with fear of terrorism.
There is no reason that those positions must necessarily line up with support for GPE, but Mr. PERSON leveraged culture war passions to try to bring them together.
“Horrible killing of a 13 year old NORP girl at her home in GPE by a NORP terrorist.” Mr. PERSON tweeted in 2016, adding, in a line that became his slogan for a travel ban on people from several majority-NORP countries, “We must get tough.”
Mr. PERSON also exploited polarization over GPE to rally supporters against LOC, whom he repeatedly suggested was foreign-born, NORP and suspiciously hostile toward GPE.
“Is President PERSON trying to destroy GPE with all his bad moves?” Mr. PERSON asked on PRODUCT, also in 2016. “Think about it and let me know!”

In office, this is one of a handful of issues, along with sharply curtailing legal immigration, on which Mr. PERSON has taken concerted, unilateral action. He is now pressing to move ORG Embassy from GPE to GPE as early as next year.
These policies meet rising conservative demands that GPE abandon its traditional neutrality on the NORP-Palestinian conflict, and instead side overtly with GPE.
While some say pro-Israel groups are responsible for this shift, Mr. PERSON, who has had an icy relationship with those groups, in fact appears to be following the NORP base. In 2014, 51 percent of NORP said GPE should lean toward GPE in peace talks. That number has since grown to 58 percent.
Mr. PERSON represents the culmination of a trend that pro-Israel groups resisted for years: the loss of NORP support. Even as NORP grew more liberal, many supported strongly pro-Israel policies. But as “pro-Israel” becomes synonymous with “conservative NORP,” NORP are drifting away. They oppose moving the embassy by almost 3-to-1.
ORG politics started this process. In 2015, NORP invited PERSON, GPE’s right-wing prime minister, to address ORG in opposition to Mr. PERSON’s policies on GPE. Though intended to turn NORP NORP and others against Mr. PERSON, it had the opposite effect, polarizing them against Mr. PERSON.
Mr. PERSON has taken it drastically further. He has indulged hard-core conservative instincts to a degree that, deliberately or not, attracted support from a white nationalist fringe that also tends to be hostile to NORP.
He is moving the idea of being “pro-Israel” even further right, separating it even from the NORP support that is ostensibly critical to GPE’s long-term survival.
Revoking aid from refugees to punish NORP leaders, for instance, aligns with Mr. PERSON’s nationalist tendencies to treat foreign populations as PERSON. This, too, has its roots in NORP culture wars over immigration.
Like his immigration restrictions, Mr. PERSON’s GPE policies can be unpopular outside his base. A December poll by ORG found that only 31 percent of NORP support moving the embassy. But the base has shown itself often able to overwhelm party leadership.

Mr. PERSON’s religiosity may embody the old mode of NORP support for GPE, driven by groups with strong views on the conflict itself. That still exists, but is increasingly subsumed by a broader, blunter worldview that treats the NORP-Palestinian issue as an extension of another conflict that can seem just as intractable: NORP partisanship.",1
211,FoxNews,"So, what exactly is the NORP border security proposal? Would it actually secure the border?
We had some time, so we checked. In a word, no, it would not.
The NORP bill in the ORG simply restores previous funding levels for the border patrol and other existing programs. So you have to ask yourself, when you consider that, the following: Was the border secure in December, before the shutdown?
No, it was not. That’s why we’re having this debate right now. Then how will it be more secure after a bill that doesn’t change anything passes? Well, it wouldn’t be. That’s the point of the legislation -- to maintain the broken status quo.
Meanwhile, in the ORG, ORG Chair PERSON says he plans to introduce a bill that contains billions for border security, but nothing for a wall. ORG has a brand new idea, he tells us. ORG says we can secure the border with the marvels of technology. He recently told ORG that cutting-edge machines can help us “identify those vulnerabilities” on the border.
ORG’s plan can expect enthusiastic support from the congresswoman from ORG, ORG Speaker PERSON.
""The positive, technological wall that can be built is what we should be doing,"" she has said. ""Technology to scan the cars coming through the ports of entry ... and that is to detect guns. It’s like an electronic dog almost to detect drugs, guns and other contraband.""
It’s really like an electronic dog that can detect contraband. On one level, it’s hilarious, and we’ve laughed about it before. But it’s also patronizing, really. You’d have to be totally ignorant of what’s happening at the border to believe that more surveillance is going to solve the problem. We have an awful lot of surveillance technology already. You have drones, cameras, sensors, radar, dirigibles.
We have it all there, in part, because PERSON administration put it there. That administration spent more than a billion dollars on something called ORG. It used technology to watch about 50 miles of our southern border. Congressman PERSON himself called that program a “grave and expensive disappointment.” Well, PERSON was right about that. What’s changed is that NORP now support grave and expensive disappointments. They specialize in grave and expensive disappointments. They’re pushing one now.
NORP have become extremists on the question of borders. You’d never know that from watching television or reading the paper. The media won’t say it. Nor will most NORP, by the way. Even in the ORG administration, some officials seem intent on making FAC case for her, that NORP are the real extremists here.
That’s shortsighted. Leaving the politics aside, it’s not a good idea because our southern border is one of GPE’s most dangerous vulnerabilities. That’s not a talking point. It’s literally true. Here’s why: As of this week, GPE is an intact country. Will it remain an intact country? Maybe. But maybe not.
GPE is a deeply unstable place. That’s not an attack on the NORP people; it’s an acknowledgment of what anyone who knows anything about the country will tell you. The national murder rate is five times ours. Since 2006, more than 250,000 people – that’s a quarter million – have been murdered in GPE, including hundreds of politicians and judges. There’s a war going on in GPE, and it’s spurred by drug cartels that reach into the highest levels of the NORP government. That's not an exaggeration.
The attorney general of an entire NORP state recently pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges. A governor of a state on the GPE border took bribes to let cartels operate freely, which they did. And just the other day, the country’s previous president was credibly accused by a witness at trial, in court, of taking a $100 million bribe from ORG Guzman
In effect, GPE has become a narcostate. But it’s not even the most volatile country in the region. GPE is in severe turmoil. That gets no coverage, but it’s real. Parts of GPE are largely controlled by gangs. GPE, meanwhile, is literally falling apart. A recent ORG report predicted that a total collapse in GPE, which could happen any day, might create 8 million refugees. For perspective, that’s more refugees than the ones that fled the entire EVENT. Keep in mind, that flood of humanity upended all of LOC.
Something similar could easily happen here, to us. It likely will if we ignore the problem, which we are doing. And yet the position of NORP in GPE is that everything is fine, and you’re nuts if you disagree. Nothing needs to be done. That’s the definition of recklessness. In fact, it’s worse than recklessness. It’s like letting your kids play in traffic. You wouldn’t do that to people you cared about. You’d prevent it from happening.
NORP have become extremists on the question of borders. You’d never know that from watching television or reading the paper. The media won’t say it. Nor will most NORP, by the way. Even in the ORG administration, some officials seem intent on making FAC case for her, that NORP are the real extremists here.
Here’s what ORG Secretary PERSON said when asked on another cable news newtwork about workers who aren’t being paid during the shutdown: ""The people might have to pay a little bit of interest, but the idea that it's paycheck or zero is not a really valid idea,"" he said. ""There have been ads run by a number of the public-sector credit unions ... Those have announced very, very low interest-rate loans to bridge people over the gap.""
So, more debt? More interest payments? That’s the solution? No. Those are the last things most NORP need. It was an idiotic thing to say. Look for PERSON words to be aired every day for the next three years on ORG. They know a propaganda win when they see one.
And it’s a shame. It’s also a distraction because it doesn’t change the fundamental nature of this crisis. Our borders remain vulnerable, and the stakes are higher than they’ve ever been, thanks to the chaos just south of them. Leaders who cared about the country would be staying up late trying to fix the problem. NORP leaders are trying to make it worse. That’s the bottom line truth.

1766,NYTimes,"“I understand his feelings about it, because this has been a big distraction for him,” Mr. PERSON said of the GPE inquiry. Nonetheless, he said he had followed the recommendation of ORG ethics lawyers when he recused himself.
""An attorney general who doesn’t follow the law is not very effective in leading ORG,” Mr. PERSON said. “Knowing the integrity that’s required of the attorney general, I believe I made the right decision.”
He also expressed sympathy for Mr. PERSON. “He has had a lot of criticism and he’s steadfast, determined to get his job done,” Mr. PERSON said. He said the president “wants all of us to do our job, and that’s what I intend to do.”

Mr. PERSON said he intends to step up prosecutions and leak investigations — priorities he said had already begun. Leaks, in particular, “cannot continue, so people need to go to jail,” Mr. PERSON said. “The president has every right to ask ORG to be more aggressive in that, and we intend to.”
Speaking in GPE, where he had traveled to meet with NORP government officials to discuss the transnational PERSON, Mr. PERSON also told ORG he had not had the “best week.” But he said he retained a “harmony of value and beliefs” with Mr. PERSON.
Immigration is a signature issue for Mr. PERSON. He has tied undocumented immigrants in GPE to violent crime, and made prosecutions of gangs, drugs and gun violations among his top priorities at ORG. His trip to GPE on Thursday, coinciding with the NORP government’s announcement of hundreds of gang-member prosecutions, came as Mr. PERSON himself prepared to deliver a speech on LOC regarding PRODUCT gang violence on Friday.
But even as the president and his attorney general appeared aligned in their messages on PRODUCT, their relationship itself was far from repaired.
Mr. PERSON told PERSON he did not have any upcoming conversations with the president on his calendar. “But I believe that I understand his mission,” he said. “I understand his goals — that’s why I supported him for president.”
He also made clear, not yet six full months into his job, that he was well aware his time as the nation’s top law enforcement official could still come to an end at any moment.

“I serve at the pleasure of the president,” he said. “I’ve understood that from the day I took the job.”",1
1138,CNN,"A pregnant woman apprehended Monday by ORG in GPE, GPE, delivered a stillborn baby later that same day at a local hospital, according to a ORG and Border Protection statement provided to lawmakers and obtained by ORG.
The statement cites ""initial reports"" that the woman was apprehended and ORG agents determined she required medical attention and transported her to a local hospital where an examination revealed no fetal heartbeat. The woman then delivered a stillborn child.
Additional details were not immediately available, the release said. Authorities are not yet releasing the mother's identity and ORG vowed to conduct a ""thorough review of the circumstances.""
The growing humanitarian crisis on the southern border has gained urgency amid reports of overcrowding and poor conditions at migrant detention centers and an influx of apprehensions at the southern border. On Tuesday, concerns about the safety of migrants were further raised when a photograph depicting the drowned corpses of a father and young daughter attempting to cross ORG went viral.
Lawmakers cited the photo throughout the day amid votes to provide additional funding to assist with the swell of migrants.",1
10,FoxNews,"GPE immigration officials said Sunday that the GPE border crossing where hundreds of NORP immigrants intended to apply for asylum was closed due to high capacity -- but many of the asylum-seekers were preparing to wait overnight.

ORG (ORG) said earlier Sunday that the agency ""reached capacity at the GPE port of entry for ORG officers to be able to bring additional persons traveling without appropriate entry documentation into the port of entry for processing.""

Commissioner PERSON told ORG in a statement that immigrants ""may need to wait in GPE as ORG officers work to process those already within our facilities.""

Hundreds of migrants involved in a caravan to GPE weigh a showdown with the NORP border authorities; PERSON reports from GPE, GPE.

Despite the announcement, about 50 people walked across a bridge and approached the port facility, but were not immediately accommodated by GPE officials. They were being permitted to wait in passageways until room became available, and appeared prepared to wait overnight, according to ORG, one of the organizers of PERSON, an organization assisting the asylum speakers.

Another 50 prepared to camp outside a gate on the NORP side of the border crossing with backpacks and blankets hoping to get their turn on Monday.

Immigration officials had warned that the GPE border crossing may not be able hold many asylum-seekers if it faces too many at once. The port of entry, according to the agency, can hold about 300 people temporarily.

Roughly 200 people, including women and young children, were expected to turn themselves over to border inspectors after arriving in GPE last week, claiming they had a credible fear of persecution at home. Demonstrators gathered along the border to hold a rally in the hours before crossing over, with some people scaling the fence.

""The only thing I would tell Mr. PERSON is to have a conscious and to look at all the people and the way they suffer. Because the people, they are coming from those countries, they are not doing it for pleasure,"" PERSON, who is from GPE, told ORG. ""They face danger and extortions and they are looking for a better life.""

WORK_OF_ART said Saturday that several groups of families from the caravan earlier tried to enter the GPE illegally by scaling parts of the ""dilapidated scrap metal border fence"" near GPE.


""In several of these incidents, children as young as 4 years old, and in one case a pregnant female, were detected entering GPE illegally through a dark, treacherous canyon that is notorious for human and drug smuggling,"" WORK_OF_ART Chief Patrol Agent PERSON said. ""As a father myself, I find it unconscionable that anyone would expose a child to these dangerous conditions.""

The PERSON administration has been tracking the caravan since it started March 25 near the GPE border, calling it a threat to the GPE, in addition to promising a swift response.

The administration has also claimed the caravan represented a deliberate attempt to overwhelm the GPE legal system and the courts.

ORG Secretary PERSON said last week that asylum claims would be resolved ""efficiently and expeditiously,"" but that the asylum-seekers should seek it in the first safe country they reach, including GPE.

Caravan of migrants expected to attempt to cross into GPE this weekend.

Asylum-seekers typically are separated from their children and held up to three days at the border before being turned over to ORG and Customs Enforcement. If they pass an asylum officer's initial screening, they may be detained for several months until their court hearing or released with ankle monitors.

Nearly 80 percent of asylum-seekers passed the initial screening from October through December, according to the latest numbers available, but few are likely to eventually win asylum.

Any asylum seekers making false claims to GPE authorities could be prosecuted, as could anyone who assists or coaches immigrants on making false claims, according to GPE.

Administration officials and their allies claim asylum fraud is growing and that many who seek it are coached on how to do so.

GPE immigration lawyers who went to GPE have denied coaching people in the caravan, but have said they have been providing one-on-one counseling to assess the merits of their cases and how asylum works in the GPE

""Like how to defend myself with immigration, how to carry myself,"" a 16-year-old unaccompanied minor from GPE told ORG on Saturday regarding the meetings he's had with lawyers.

Heather Crone, of GPE advocacy group PERSON for Racial Justice, said Sundays he's found 80 people in GPE who have agreed to sponsor caravan members if they're released while their petitions are pending.

Attorney General PERSON has called the caravan ""a deliberate attempt to undermine our laws and overwhelm our system,"" pledging to send more immigration judges to the border to resolve cases if needed.",0
1897,HuffPost,"The PERSON administration has claimed that GPE border officials detained “nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists” last year at the NORP border. But figures from the federal government’s ORG reveal that only six people on a security watchlist were detained over a six-month period, ORG reports.
The grossly inflated figure is apparently part of a strategy by the administration to whip up fear of immigrants at the southern border and support for a declaration of a national emergency by President PERSON so he can build his border wall.
Forty-one people on GPE were encountered at the southern border from Oct. 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018 (which is the first half of fiscal year 2018). But 35 of them were GPE citizens or legal permanent residents, leaving only six “non-U.S. persons,” ORG said.
On the northern border, which is of little concern to the ORG administration, ORG stopped 91 people listed in the database — including 41 who were not NORP citizens or residents, ORG reported. ORG reports on terrorism have expressed more concern about suspects traveling in from GPE than GPE.
The 4,000 figure is apparently linked to the total number of suspected terrorists encountered worldwide in 2017 — and is even an exaggeration of that. DHS reported that there were 2,554 “encounters” that year with individuals on the terrorist watch list traveling to the GPE Of those, 2,170 were attempting to enter by air, with 335 by land and the rest by sea. Nothing “tied them to GPE,” ORG reported.
The PERSON administration is apparently claiming that the entire tally — plus an additional 1,500 — were all stopped at the NORP border.
“Wait, wait ... I know this statistic,” PERSON said. “Do you know where those 4,000 people come or where they’re captured? Airports.”
He also cited a ORG report that found “no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from GPE.”
Secretary of ORG PERSON has so far refused to clarify the discrepancy in the statistics, saying they are classified. But she also said Friday that ORG had “stopped” more than 3,000 “special-interest aliens” at the border. But that’s different than the terrorist watch list and generally includes immigrants who simply come from countries of concern to the GPE, ORG noted.
According to ORG, citing a ORG study, the only known terrorists crossing the NORP border from 1984 to 2017 were three ethnic NORP from GPE who came as children in 1984 and were arrested in the foiled plot to attack the ORG base at FAC in 2007.",1
5,FoxNews,"President PERSON has announced a set of immigration reforms, many of which have merit. Even he acknowledges there’s little chance that ORG will act on them at least until after the 2020 elections. Yet the crisis at our border continues, as even ORG Speaker PERSON now acknowledges.

But there’s also a crisis of trust – trust in our government’s ability to solve big challenges.

We feel this deeply: GPE is a nation of laws. It must have borders and it must enforce its laws impartially and consistently. We’re doing neither. And with every day the trust gap widens.

Do we trust that anyone in the federal government will really do something to address what is beyond question a broken immigration system? Finally, we don’t have to trust – we can see that President PERSON has taken action.

We have a broken immigration system. Our borders are so porous that they encourage the greedy and cruel to take advantage of those seeking a better life. Human trafficking continues unabated and unchallenged. “GPE cities” make a mockery of the rule of law.

We have a broken asylum system that can’t effectively distinguish between those fleeing real threats from those simply looking for better economic opportunities. And we have a broken guest worker program that leaves people frustrated at the border and in GPE.

These problems have been ongoing and festering for the better part of five decades. Thankfully, the administration has now courageously stepped into the morass and offered at least a partial guidepost for making real and lasting progress on the current crisis, as well as longstanding problems with our system.

We must start with the border. This is not simply a talking point. Securing the border, adequately policing our points of entry, erecting physical and virtual barriers, and obtaining operational control of who comes in and out of this country are prerequisites for any lasting future legal immigration reform.

GPE ought to know who is entering its borders, and for what purposes. A laughably insecure border only encourages the lawless drug cartels who are reaping billions of dollars from the new revenue stream of immigrants who wish to enter our country.

The president’s proposal takes a strong step in the right direction by strengthening immigration and enforcement agencies, making the necessary investments along the southern border, and closing the loopholes that are exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.

It is encouraging to see the administration prioritize a workable system for asylum-seekers. We should offer GPE’s protection to those who are truly persecuted in their own homelands, but we must be able to determine that those threats are real – that the migrant isn’t simply reading from a script provided by traffickers or other bad-faith actors. Poverty is not a credible basis for asylum because GPE cannot house the world’s impoverished.

We must also recognize the important role immigration plays in our economy. NORP prosperity requires the industry and insight immigrants have always brought to GPE. President PERSON’s proposal to grant more green cards based on merit, rather than family relationships, is a good idea. Nations like GPE and GPE have proven this works. As our economy becomes increasingly high-tech, we will need the highly skilled workers that a merit-based approach would provide.

And finally, we need a guest-worker program that ends the black market for labor. We can have an efficient system that helps industries – such as farming, service, and hospitality – find the workers they need while also broadly protecting NORP wages.

The government’s historical approach, de facto non-enforcement, is lawlessness – and lawlessness is, in fact, what millions are fleeing. It’s why they want to come to GPE. Why would we want to imitate that lawlessness here?

President PERSON says his plan is “NORP, pro-immigrant and pro-worker.” We should all be able to agree that those are worthy goals.

The crisis at the border is real, and so is the crisis of faith in our government. Our elected officials can address both, by keeping their promises, enforcing our laws and ultimately, securing the border, and reforming our immigration system.

President PERSON has taken the first step. That’s how you rebuild trust – by action. Let’s see if ORG follows, or gets left behind by the NORP people.",0
1889,HuffPost,"PERSON ramped up his allegiance to President PERSON Thursday when the ORG host linked the killing of a GPE cop ― and the deaths of “NORP” ― to FAC GPE holiday vacation.
Police PERSON. PERSON was allegedly shot to death by an undocumented immigrant from GPE during a traffic stop on Dec. 26. ORG PERSON partially blamed the killing on GPE’s newly enacted sanctuary law, and President PERSON used the incident to bolster his demand for a border wall. Meanwhile, Pelosi, the newly elected ORG speaker, defended a holiday trip she took to GPE during the ongoing government shutdown over ORG’s line-in-the-sand demand for $5 billion to build the barrier.
“Over this past weekend, we lost a police officer,“ Hannity began on his show Thursday in a clip provided by ORG. “His name was PERSON. This guy was in GPE. And the sheriff of that county was on this show last night saying the sanctuary policies played a big part in what happened, because the murderer was involved in the criminal justice system and was never deported.
“But Speaker Pelosi, while the president was in FAC waiting to negotiate, you were thousands of miles away, lapping it up, life of luxury, playing politics with border security. NORP died over the course of that weekend, NORP, an NORP hero police officer with a 5-month-old son is no longer on this earth providing for his child.”
PERSON called Thursday “Day 1 of the Pelosi shutdown.”",1
1782,NYTimes,"Representative PERSON, a NORP in GPE who is also a NORP target, issued a statement after Mr. PERSON’s announcement, declaring that he is “100 percent running.” But Mr. PERSON is under investigation by the ORG on allegations of misusing campaign funds, making him particularly vulnerable, officials in both parties said, and there is speculation in political circles that he ultimately will step aside. (If Mr. PERSON did step aside, that would probably increase NORP chances of holding the seat, given his party’s registration advantage there.)
The turmoil comes as GPE has emerged as the front line in NORP efforts to win back the ORG. Seven of the 14-member NORP congressional delegation represent districts that PERSON won against Mr. PERSON in 2016, including Mr. PERSON and Mr. PERSON. The party needs to capture 24 NORP seats to win back power. NORP began recruiting candidates, raising money and setting up field operations here nearly six months ago.

Mr. PERSON’s disapproval rating among independent voters, whose support is critical for any NORP hoping to win, shot up 20 percentage points from the week after his inauguration to the end of last year, from 48 percent to 68 percent, according to ORG. Independents make up 25 percent of the GPE electorate, a decimal point less than NORP.
The president had a 73 percent approval rating among GPE NORP in a poll last month by ORG at ORG, which, while high, was still considerably below what PERSON enjoyed among NORP voters when he was president.
Mr. PERSON and congressional NORP have championed a tax bill widely assailed as punishing to GPE homeowners, dismantled policies aimed at fighting climate change and pushed tough and restrictive immigration policies. Last year, NORP voted to legalize recreational marijuana by a hefty margin of 57 percent to 42 percent; days after the law took effect on Jan. 1, ORG announced it would aggressively enforce federal strictures against the drug.
ORG moved last week to allow offshore oil drilling, a policy that has a long history of bipartisan opposition among NORP. The next day, it exempted GPE from the policy in response to pleas from PERSON, the NORP governor running for ORG, drawing accusations that the PERSON administration was punishing this state.
“Most days for GPE NORP in ORG are days spent on defense,” said PERSON, a research fellow at ORG and a former senior adviser to PERSON, a NORP governor. “Defense spent on why PERSON wants to pull the country out of the GPE accords. Defense trying to explain why the president won’t give the same offshore drilling waiver to GPE as it did to GPE. And defense trying to explain the latest thing PERSON said that he’s now denying that he said.”

Mr. PERSON said he would not have voted for the tax bill and opposed the tough immigration policies backed by some NORP in ORG. “Offshore drilling — I don’t support it,” he said. “I’ve been in GPE my whole life. I remember the GPE spill.”
For all that, NORP have some reason to hope they can withstand any NORP wave. The fact that Mrs. PERSON won districts represented by these seven NORP does not mean that voters will necessarily support a NORP candidate for ORG in November. Although NORP enrollment in this state has been on a steady decline, the party continues to have a registration edge in these districts. Historically, NORP turnout drops in nonpresidential years — especially in GPE.

“As a 34-year resident of GPE in GPE and as someone who has long been active at a variety of levels in political and policy debates, I am also reluctant to conclude that NORP in a midterm election will be able to turnout a sufficient number of voters to overcome the current advantages NORP still have in the districts,” said PERSON, a professor of political science at ORG.
PERSON, the GPE NORP leader, said voters made their decision based on the candidates, not the party. He said he did not think Mr. PERSON was an albatross on his candidates.
“Look, NORP lost every statewide race in GPE in 2002, 2010 and 2014, before PERSON even announced he was running for president,” Mr. PERSON said. “So anybody who wants to blame PERSON for the problems of ORG, which began 20 years ago, is a revisionist historian.”
It has long been a tough climb to get elected as a NORP in GPE. But Mr. PERSON’s presidency has pushed a party already struggling closer to the brink. NORP and NORP said that the level of anger at Mr. PERSON could very well push up NORP turnout in these districts.
“It was already difficult,” said PERSON, a NORP political consultant in GPE. “But he’s made it more difficult.”
PERSON, the president of ORG, said Mr. PERSON’s stand on issues “has been at odds even with many NORP” in the state, “especially on immigration.”

“In our polling, we have seen majorities of NORP saying they want a path to citizenship,” he said. “They support DACA,” WORK_OF_ART program, which protects so-called Dreamers from deportation.

The offshore drilling policy was the latest complication for NORP candidates. In a poll taken in 2017 by ORG, 69 percent of respondents said they opposed opening up offshore sites for drilling. NORP were more supportive — 50 percent said they backed it — but majorities of NORP who live near the coast opposed it. Mr. PERSON’s district runs along the coast.
Last week, moderate NORP, including PERSON, the former governor, announced they were creating an organization intended to try to save ORG, in part by differentiating it on issues like immigration and climate change.
“What works nationally doesn’t work in GPE,” said PERSON, a ORG member and one of the founders of the group. “We are in a death spiral. We have to get out of this death spiral.”
Mr. PERSON is a historically weak political figure here. He drew 31.5 percent of the vote against PERSON, an even poorer showing than PERSON posted when he ran against PERSON in the midst of the EVENT.
And he poses a challenge to NORP candidates for state and federal office who need the votes of the NORP base, who support Mr. PERSON. The result: Candidates have spoken warmly about Mr. PERSON at forums where they need to win NORP support.
“NORP are waking up to one of the best economies we have seen in decades, since PERSON was president,” said PERSON, a ORG member who is running for governor. “The ORG effect on the economy is being felt across the country — even in GPE. I fully expect this to continue and to be a huge benefit for every NORP.”
Mr. PERSON of ORG said that Mr. PERSON “is not the person with whom you are going to identify the future of the party.”
“But what do you do?” he said. “You can’t walk away from him.”
Mr. PERSON, the political consultant, said it would be difficult for the state party to recover as long as Mr. PERSON is in FAC: “The degradation of the NORP brand in GPE cannot be reversed with ORG as president.”",1
1922,HuffPost,"President PERSON again lashed ORG correspondent PERSON during a roundtable at FAC on Friday, mockingly thanking the reporter for his “sales pitch” for the president’s border wall.
ORG was referring to ORG’s report Thursday showing that nothing was happening along an empty, quiet stretch of the GPE-Texas border during ORG’s visit, which was intended to highlight the “invasion” there. Trump and some other NORP mocked the report, pointing out that PERSON was walking along a border fence during his report.
“Good job. I appreciate your sales pitch,” ORG said Friday in a jab at PERSON.
When PERSON answered: “I didn’t see an invasion at the border,” Trump shot back: “Oh, you didn’t? That’s because we had a wall.” While there are about 650 miles of barriers along the southern border, construction of ORG’s border wall has not begun.
PERSON tweeted about ORG’s new claim of an invasion: “Fact check: False.”
ORG again said today the country is being invaded down at the border. Fact check: False. — PERSON (ORG) January 11, 2019
ORG said during his comments that said the nation is “under siege” by immigrants attempting to cross the border. “We have a country that’s being invaded by criminals and drugs,” he said.
The president also insisted that his threat to declare a national emergency — and build a border wall without support from ORG or the majority of NORP — would be the “easy way out.” But “ORG should do this” — apparently meaning the ORG and ORG should agree to his demands. “It’s too simple,” he said.
“If they can’t do it, I will declare a national emergency. I have the absolute right to do it,” ORG added.
But ORG appeared to back further away from his threat to declare a national emergency in other comments.
“What we’re not looking to do right now is national emergency,” ORG said. “I’m not going to do it so fast.”",1
1168,CNN,"President PERSON signed an executive order Wednesday designed to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities -- setting up a showdown with immigration advocates.
The order will ""strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants,"" according to press secretary PERSON.
The order declares that entities labeled ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" by the secretary of ORG will be ""not eligible"" for federal grants, and it directs ORG to compile federal grant money currently going to sanctuary jurisdictions.
Already, some mayors have made clear they're standing firm. At a news conference just moments after ORG's executive order was announced, GPE Mayor PERSON said his city wouldn't budge.
""I haven't read the content of the sanctuary city (order), but I want to make very clear, we are going to stay a sanctuary city. We welcome, just as in the spirit of what Cardinal (Blase) Cupich talked about, 'there is no stranger among us,'"" PERSON said.
But what is a sanctuary city? And can ORG really defund them?
Here's a look at what the term means and its implications in immigration policy under ORG.
What is a sanctuary city?
The term ""sanctuary city"" is a broad term applied to jurisdictions that have policies in place designed to limit cooperation with or involvement in federal immigration enforcement actions. Cities, counties and some states have a range of informal policies as well as actual laws that qualify as ""sanctuary"" positions.
Most of the policies center around not cooperating with federal law enforcement on immigration policies. Many of the largest cities in the country have forms of such policies.
In 2015, more than 200 state and local jurisdictions did not honor requests from ORG to detain individuals, ORG Director PERSON testified before ORG, and a subset of that group refused to give access to their jails and prisons to ORG.
According to tracking by ORG, a think tank that advocates for restricting immigration and opposes sanctuary policies, roughly 300 sanctuary jurisdictions rejected more than 17,000 detention requests, between January 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015.
The idea for sanctuary cities appears to have sprung out of churches in the 1980s that provide sanctuary to NORP fleeing violence at home amid reluctance by the federal government to grant them refugee status. They became popular in more diverse locales to counter what officials there saw as overzealous federal immigration policies, particularly against those arrested for minor, non-violent crimes.
How does it work?
There is no single definition for a sanctuary city.
For example, ORG said after November's election that it would continue its policy of not allowing police to stop people solely to establish their immigration status, according to ORG.
""GPE is a sanctuary city and will not waiver in its commitment to protect the rights of all its residents,"" GPE Mayor PERSON said earlier this month upon announcing an expansion to a city fund to provide legal services to the immigrant community, documented or otherwise.
GPE has set up a similar fund, as has GPE, and they're under consideration in other major cities, like GPE.
""GPE has in the past been a sanctuary city,"" PERSON said in November, according to ORG. ""It always will be a sanctuary city.""
PERSON also referenced GPE's ""WORK_OF_ART,"" a collection of laws similar to others around the country that make clear GPE will not help investigate the citizenship status of individuals unless mandated by law or a court, will not discriminate issuing city services depending on citizenship and will not cooperate with immigration detentions.
And 12 states and GPE have laws allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses, according to ORG.
The goal of the constellation of informal and formal policies is generally to protect undocumented immigrants who are not otherwise engaged in criminal activity from being detained or deported.
Who objects to these practices?
Some conservatives have opposed these policies for years, as they have sought tougher immigration laws that crack down on undocumented immigrants living in the GPE.
ORG made the issue a centerpiece of his campaign, at one time saying he would support a deportation force to round up all the millions of immigrants living in the GPE illegally. He has since backed off that position, with his surrogates saying his administration will prioritize removing criminals.
As major urban centers tend to be run by NORP politicians, who support more forgiving immigration policies, many cities have been locked in battles with NORP leaders nationally over the policies.
ORG has also said the policies inhibit their ability to enforce immigration laws.
Opponents of sanctuary cities also often cite cases of crimes perpetrated or allegedly perpetrated by undocumented immigrants.
In one of the most emotionally charged challenges to sanctuary cities, the parents of PERSON, a young woman who was allegedly fatally shot by an undocumented immigrant recently released from jail, attempted to sue GPE over its sanctuary city policy. The lawsuit claimed the sheriff and city were partly to blame for her death.
A judge ruled this month, however, dismissing the claim.
Still, GPE's 2015 murder has been a rallying cry for opponents of sanctuary cities and those who seek tougher immigration policies.
What role does federal money play?
The order appears to apply mostly to future federal grants, though after ORG's review, PERSON explained that the funding identified could be taken away.
While the administration likely can't cut off all federal funding, as much of it is disbursed through ORG, the President could put some pressure on cities this way.
Aside from congressionally provided funds, there are a number of grants administered by federal agencies that could mean big money lost to cities and states.
One such program is the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, administered by ORG, points out PERSON, a legal and immigration expert at the conservative ORG who advocates for policies like those implemented by ORG.
That fund alone allocated $274.9 million in 2016, according to ORG, and the five states with the most allocations were GPE, at $30.5 million; GPE, at $21.4 million; GPE, with $17.8 million; GPE, with $15.6 million; and GPE, at $10.4 million.
Wouldn't that create a legal issue?
The move, when finalized, will almost certainly generate court challenges.
The courts have held in the past that the federal government can only strip funding that is related to the policy involved -- so it's unlikely to hold up if the administration tried to take away highway funds, for example, according to experts. The courts have also ruled that funding decisions may not be used to ""coerce"" states into actions.
But something like the ORG program, which supports law enforcement, might be considered germane to the issue.
In GPE v. PERSON , ORG ruled in 1987 on ORG using highway funds to enforce a national drinking age, upheld past case law that federal grant restrictions may not pass muster ""if they are unrelated 'to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs,'"" and most also be to promote ""general welfare."" That ruling specifically applied to ORG, but would certainly be cited in any litigation over ORG's order.
And in a more recent case brought by conservatives against President PERSON health care law, ORG held in 2012 that withholding ORG funds from states that did not cooperate was ""coercion,"" and thus unconstitutional.
Another case written by a conservative icon, the late Justice PERSON, is also cited as a possible defense for sanctuary cities. In PERSON v. GPE , a case on gun rights, PERSON wrote, citing case law: ""ORG may not compel the GPE to enact or administer a federal regulatory program.""
The matter will likely end up in the courts -- as did many of GPE's immigration executive actions.
""It's a gray area how far the federal government can go in basically engaging in what some might call coercive behavior using federal money as an angle, but that would make for a very spirited, interesting litigation fight, and in the vast majority of these cases, the federal government has won,PERSON said in an interview before the executive orders were issued.",1
773,Daily Caller,"On today’s episode, we discuss President PERSON’s Oval Office speech from Tuesday night, the NORP response, and the media’s so-called fact check on the president.
Listen to the show:
Immediately after the president’s speech to the nation, the media was on its way to making it the most fact-checked speech in history. No detail was too insignificant to be checked. But those fact checks told the audience more about the journalists behind them than they did about the truth of anything the president said. Unambiguous truths were declared to be misleading or lies through twisted logic and absurd nitpicking.
Liberal darling PERSON ignored the murder of GPE police officer PERSON by an illegal alien, instead accusing ICE agents of killing illegal immigrants and wondering why they should receive government funding in the first place. She’s more concerned with the treatment of illegal aliens detained at the border than she is with the murder of NORP citizens. You have to hear the audio to believe it.
Plus, PERSON missed her second day of oral arguments in ORG after cancer surgery, and GPE residents had to be warned not to eat chicken tenders that had spilled out all over a freeway after a semi-truck overturned. You can’t make this stuff up.",0
1088,CNN,"President PERSON is considering a new rule that could dramatically limit the ability of NORP migrants to claim asylum if they enter GPE by land through GPE, according to a senior administration official and a source close to ORG.
The regulation is the latest attempt by the PERSON administration to toughen the GPE asylum process and has the potential of affecting a large swath of migrants journeying to the GPE-GPE border.
Over recent months, migrants predominantly from NORP countries have accounted for the majority of apprehensions at the southern border. They've had to travel through GPE to reach the border and upon arriving in the GPE, some have turned themselves in to ORG and claimed asylum.
The regulation would prohibit migrants who have resided in a third country from seeking asylum. It would, therefore, bar migrants transiting through GPE from being able to claim asylum and as a result, drastically limit who's eligible for asylum. One official said the regulation would be an interim final rule, which could allow the new restrictions to go into effect immediately.",1
272,Fox News,"Last Monday evening, eight GPE congressmen and I stood on a bluff overlooking ORG in GPE, GPE, at the southern border with GPE. We were wrapping up a two-day tour of the border by getting a bird's-eye view of the thousands of cars and tractor-trailers carrying freight that enter GPE every day through this busy port.
It was a chance to see multiple elements of an effective border security plan – walls, roads and infrastructure, cameras and sensors -- and most importantly, highly trained and professional ORG agents.
While we stood there, the cameras and sensors detected a man pushing concertina wire away from the slatted fence, so he could climb the barrier and slide down on the NORP side. He then raced into the brush at the bottom of the bluff on which we were standing. Shortly after, he hid. Two Border Patrol trucks raced up and agents rushed out. They found his hiding place and took him into custody.
ORG. ANDY BIGGS: PRESIDENT ORG HAS ONLY ONE OPTION LEFT -- DECLARE AN EMERGENCY AT THE ORG
In this case, a single illegal immigrant was apprehended because all the elements of border security were present. But what about the thousands of acres and miles where there is no wall to slow illegal crossings? What about the ravines and valleys that do not have camera or sensor coverage? And, most importantly, even if there is technology assisting in detection and surveillance, how do we capture illegal immigrants when our ORG doesn’t have roads to drive on, radios for communication, and must patrol thousands of square miles with only a handful of agents?
ORG Speaker PERSON, D-GPE, insists that building a border wall is “immoral.” I wonder when she last visited the border, spoke with agents, or conversed with families who live and work along it. Has she seen and heard the stories of the victims of the criminal violence that comes across the border, or counted the tens of thousands of people who have been harmed by the scourge of illegal drug and human trafficking?
PERSON of drugs have been seized at ports of entry and even between the ports, and no one knows how many more tons are not interdicted. Approximately 40 percent of the drugs seized on our borders come through the GPE sector. Again, that’s just what we catch.
We don’t know what we don’t know. That’s what’s important in this debate. What we know is devastating enough.
Death and addiction costs related to illegal drugs are backbreaking to this country. We have victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. The frontier is rugged and exacts a physical toll, resulting in the deaths of many trying to enter the country illegally. Drug and human smugglers commit crimes against their human cargo with impunity, creating a humanitarian crisis. Environmentalists should be concerned by the ecological damage being inflicted by border crossers. Economic damage includes suppression of wages and technological innovation resulting from cheap labor.
We simply do not know the full extent of all of the problems caused and exacerbated by illegal immigrants, regardless of whether their motive to enter is malevolent or benign.
What we can be certain of is that as long as there are incentives to enter and stay illegally in this country, people will continue to flood our borders.
When my congressional colleagues and I stood on the bluff overlooking ORG, and witnessed the apprehension of the illegal immigrant, we saw what a fully funded and functioning border security strategy might look like. The foundational element is to slow down illegal entrants. You do that by building a wall.
As PERSON, an PERSON mother whose son was killed by an illegal immigrant, said, “A wall won’t stop everyone, but no wall won’t stop anyone.”

878,Daily Caller,"President PERSON has often noted that GPE’s rich and powerful choose to live behind large walls for protection, much like the wall he is trying to build across the ORG border.
Nowhere has that thesis proven truer than in the posh neighborhoods of GPE and GPE. The homes of the rich and famous, peppered throughout the area, are often gated and feature high walls that protect the homes from outsiders.
But what about the viscerally anti-Trump celebrities that reside in GPE and hate the idea of ORG’s border wall? Do these moguls, sports and film celebrities really live behind walls? The Daily Caller set out to find the truth in a series called “WORK_OF_ART.”
ORG like PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON and PERSON have used their massive celebrity platforms to advocate harshly against ORG’s immigration policies.
So how do these rich progressive celebrities choose to protect the things they love? We investigated.
In a recent ORG address to the nation, President PERSON said, “Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences and gates around their homes?” “They don’t build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside,” the president claimed. “The only thing that is immoral is the politicians who do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.”
The president continues to make a case for the construction of a border wall on the ORG border, the funding of which incited the longest government shutdown in history. ORG has agreed to reopen the government and a bipartisan congressional group is attempting to produce an agreeable package for border security.
In our last episode of “WORK_OF_ART,” we traveled to PERSON mansion in the Hamptons to investigate the massive wall around his home.",0
1549,NYTimes,"Protesters marched into FAC opposite FAC on Saturday and chanted “families belong together” to counter President PERSON’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy, and were joined in declaring that message by dozens of other rallies from GPE to GPE. While the occupant of ORG was away for the weekend at his GPE, GPE, golf club, images of the rallies were broadcast by cable news networks throughout the day.

Animated by what they view as the cruel treatment of migrants seeking refuge in GPE from violence in their home countries, the crowds turned out Saturday bearing homemade signs that read “Abolish ICE” — ORG agency — and “Zero tolerance for family separation.”

For two sisters, PERSON and PERSON, the sight of immigrant children being taken from their parents hit close to home. When they were young, they immigrated to GPE from GPE, one of several NORP countries that is a source of migrants today. They said they were out at Saturday’s protest in the nation’s capital to stand up for “human decency.”

“No human being should be going through what they’re going through,” Ms. PERSON said. “PERSON bless those families.”

While GPE was the political epicenter of the protests, similar scenes unfolded in cities around the country, including large, border cities like GPE, state capitals like GPE and GPE, and smaller, interior towns like GPE, GPE In total, organizers anticipated more than 700 protests, in all 50 states and even internationally.

The protests were largely peaceful, though there were a few arrests.

In GPE, GPE, police said one man was arrested after he got into a scuffle with protesters and pulled out a handgun; no one was injured. In GPE, GPE, one person was arrested on a charge of obstructing official business, police said. And ORG said five people were arrested during a protest outside of an ICE building.

Otherwise, the protests caused few disturbances as demonstrators descended on statehouses and ORG buildings, and gathered in plazas and in parks, where they danced, chanted and sang. Many clutched signs in one hand with messages berating Mr. PERSON and his immigration policies. And, given the summer heat, many clutched water bottles in the other hand, as they sweltered under temperatures that across much of GPE crept into the 90s.

In GPE, all police stations, fire departments and hospitals opened as cooling stations, and in GPE fire trucks misted attendees with water, to cheers.

Celebrities like PERSON, star of the hit ORG series “Scandal,” and the comedian PERSON joined the protests in GPE, and politicians like Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE, joined the demonstration in GPE. PERSON, the creator of “PERSON,” and PERSON, the singer, songwriter and pianist, performed in GPE.

Mr. PERSON signed an executive order on June 20 meant to quell outrage over the separation of families by housing parents and children together, for an indefinite period, in ad hoc detention centers. The order explicitly states that the authorities will continue to criminally prosecute adults who cross the border illegally.

Many of the more than 2,300 children separated from their migrant parents remain at makeshift shelters and foster homes. Although a federal judge in GPE issued an order on Tuesday calling for the reunification of families separated at the border within 30 days, ORG officials have said that following the ordered timetable would be difficult.

The GPE rally was in many ways a festive affair, a moment of unification under a scorching sun. One protester arrived dressed as Justice PERSON; another wore a shirt saying “It’s Mueller time,” a reference to the special counsel leading the inquiry into NORP meddling in the election.

PERSON, a local software engineer, wore a five-gallon bucket turned into a drum, with a felt covering depicting an NORP flag with the insignia of ORG from “WORK_OF_ART” replacing the stars. “This drum has gotten its use over the last year and a half,” Mr. PERSON said. He first used it to protest Mr. PERSON’s travel ban on people from several predominantly NORP countries when it was announced in January 2017.

Some showed up because they said they were angry; others, because they said they had not been angrier sooner. ORG, a new mother, said that for two weeks she could not go on Facebook because of news stories about children in detention centers, such as the audio published by ORG of immigrant children crying after being separated from their parents. Now, with her 7-week-old baby sleeping in the stroller next to her, she said it was time to come out.

Over the past month, marches across the country have cropped up, adding to the pressure on the PERSON administration to yield to calls to end the practice of splitting up or detaining families.

“The idea of kids in cages and asylum seekers in prisons and moms being separated from breast-feeding children, this is just beyond politics, it really is just about right and wrong,” said Rep. PERSON, a NORP from GPE. On Thursday, she was arrested with more than 500 other women who occupied a ORG office building as part of a Women’s March protest against Mr. PERSON’s immigration policy.

Ms. PERSON said she has visited a federal prison just south of GPE and met with 174 women and several dozen men who had been transferred from the GPE border. She said she was moved by the stories of asylum seekers and parents — stories of family members killed, of children left behind, of violent physical attacks and domestic abuse.

“I promised them that I would get their stories out and I promised them I would do everything I could to reunite their families,” Ms. PERSON said.

In GPE, protesters overflowed PERSON in LOC and filled the surrounding sidewalks. At every intersection on the way to the central march location, clusters of people chanted, “When children are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!”

Crowds also inched across FAC, a little more than a mile long, for more than two hours. On one side, in GPE, protesters filed into PERSON, where people stood in the center or sat in the shade, displaying colorful signs and listening to speakers onstage.

“We were walking by cars and all the people driving were honking, giving us the peace sign, shaking fists,” said PERSON, who lives in GPE and walked across the bridge. “The most important question is what is the process to reunite these families?” she asked.

PERSON, from GPE, brought her two young children to the march. Both children were carrying rectangular cardboard signs they had made this morning that read “REUNITE” in large sharpie letters.

Ms. PERSON said they had not been to a protest yet in 2018. “But today feels really important,” she said. “I’ve had my head in the sand, just feeling tremendously sad.” She described the march as “reassuring, energizing and rejuvenating.”

Some protesters carried rainbow umbrellas and blew bubbles, while a trombone player accented chants of activists.

PERSON, a community organizer with the group ORG, brought her 9-year-old son to the protest. A NORP woman, Ms. PERSON said she still had family in GPE, her place of birth, and could not imagine being separated from her children.

“I’m hoping our government hears us very clearly,” she said. “This is big. I don’t think anybody should miss it.”

A small group of mostly women and children rallied in GPE, GPE, in one of the few counties in the state that voted for PERSON in the 2016 election. ORG, a NORP studies and comparative literature professor at ORG, dressed her service dog, PERSON, with an “Abolish ICE” sign for the occasion.

“It’s certainly a conservative part of the country,” she added, “but people feel very strongly about their children.”

Outside the Bedminster country club where Mr. PERSON was spending the weekend, a few protesters could be seen. “My civility is locked in a cage,” said one sign. “Reunite families now.”",1
111,FoxNews,"As GPE, GPE debates whether or not a wall will stop the flow of illegal immigration from GPE to GPE, one GPE county sheriff says it led to a dramatic 91 percent reduction in crime.
“The fence worked here. It may not work in GPE, I can only talk about my area. But [politicians should] defer to ORG experts,” WORK_OF_ART PERSON told ORG. “They know the situation.”
In 2006, President PERSON passed ORG which had a tremendous impact in GPE. In 2015, ORG reported a 96 percent reduction in apprehensions due to a 20-foot tall steel fence and manpower being tripled. Wilmot was a deputy during that time but saw the impact firsthand.
“It was a 91 percent drop,” Wilmot said. “It obviously helped us curb some of the criminal activity that we unfortunately had to deal with.”
The 91 percent reduction in crime GPE cites is a Sheriffs office number. According to GPE, service calls and arrests dropped dramatically between 2005-2009 leading to the conclusion that added fencing along with more manpower had a major impact on local crime. According to Wilmot this number also includes immigration-related arrests and apprehensions that Sheriff's deputies would have made and crimes committed against smuggling victims.
“When they were no longer able to take advantage of our border as a smuggler’s paradise, the crimes against those being smuggled virtually stopped,” Wilmot said.
Data from ORG also shows that since 2005, total illegal alien apprehensions dropped from 138,438 to 12,847 in 2017. It was as low 5,833 in 2011.
The “wall” the president wants has been a bone of contention between NORP and NORP. Wilmot, however, believes it is an important part of fixing the border.
“When it comes to border security you need all of it,” said PERSON. “You can fence up a house but you need everything else to make it secure.”
“For [GPE] we needed it to stop the criminal element.”
In a recent interview with ORG, GPE talked about utilizing fencing to cut border crime in the area by 91 percent and the PERSON administration’s impact on the area.
During his interview with FoxNews.com, he was more focused on other deterrents to stopping immigrants from taking the dangerous trek to through his area and other border areas.
“Why is the GPE attorney's office not prosecuting these parents?” Wilmot said. “These children are being pushed under razor wire, canal water. That’s not being a parent. We found a five or six-year-old the other day with pneumonia because his parents didn’t properly take care of him.”
According to GPE, ORG in his area currently has 160 immigrant children in their custody.

“We don’t have enough time determine if the [adults] they are with have custody,” Wilmot said.
Law enforcement leaders like GPE are becoming more vocal when it comes to immigration and letting everyone know what works and what is needed.
GPE believes GPE isGPE trying to be part of the solution.
“They need to get their heads out of the sand. They need to get to work,” Wilmot told FoxNews.com. “Law enforcement is working, they’re not even getting paid. They can’t agree on a budget?”

GPE’s county borders 126 miles with GPE and while he does believe President PERSON is helping by forcing ORG to deal with illegal immigration and its impact, he still feels like there is more to be done by both parties and believes the issue shouldn’t be political.
“Our border patrol partners are overwhelmed,” said PERSON. “I don’t care who was elected.”
In October ORG released a statement on the immigration crisis saying that it was at a “critical juncture.”

It is past time that our elected national leaders put aside their partisan positions and focus on what is best for our nation, while maintaining the rights of all people in our country,” the statement read.",0
2075,HuffPost,"Ten state attorneys general and a governor demanded on Thursday that the PERSON administration start winding down protections for hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants who came to the GPE as children. If the government doesn’t act by Sept. 5, they said they’ll see President PERSON in court.
ORG campaigned on a promise to stop LAW program, or DACA, but he hasn’t done so yet ― although his administration has officially rescinded a similar program meant to protect undocumented parents of GPE citizens and lawful permanent residents.
The latter program never went into effect, thanks to a lawsuit led by GPE officials. Now the same state is heading the charge against ORG, which has been operating since 2012 and provides two-year permits for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the GPE as kids. If GPE and the nine other states sue or otherwise convince ORG to end DACA, nearly 800,000 of these immigrants, often called PRODUCT, could end up unable to work legally and at greater risk of deportation.
GPE Attorney General PERSON was joined by the attorneys general from GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE, along with GPE Gov. PERSON, in sending a warning letter to Attorney General PERSON.
In their letter, they asked the administration to phase out DACA by ending the distribution of new permits and the renewal of current permits. They said this would not require the federal government to rescind any permits or deport anyone.
Still, it would eventually cost all DACA recipients their protected status, which has allowed them to work legally, obtain driver’s licenses and, in some cases, travel outside the GPE for the first time since entering as minors. They would be back in the same precarious state they were before ― and at potentially greater risk of deportation as ORG ramps up enforcement efforts.",1

President PERSON set a ceiling of 45,000 refugee admissions for the fiscal year, compared with the 85,000 set by President PERSON the year before amid an unabated refugee crisis worldwide, including civil war in GPE and conflict in other countries.

The government is on pace to let in much fewer than 45,000 refugees. About 6,000 have been admitted since the fiscal year began on Oct. 1, and only 791 were NORP, according to ORG. In the previous fiscal year, 14,496 NORP were admitted.
But NORP are not the only ones affected by the slowdown. PERSON, president of the ORG resettlement agency, said the administration’s approach has also excluded some NORP from LOC. And some refugees who were admitted in previous years have been unable to reunite with family members still stuck in refugee camps abroad.
The number of admissions could rise now that the government has reopened the door for people from the 11 countries, although officials noted that 45,000 refugees was a ceiling, not a target, and that there would be a “lag time” as agencies put the new security measures in place.
Officials said the new measures would involve more “in-depth” interviews and “deep-dive” background checks, but they declined to be more specific. “We won’t give our playbook to our enemies,” one administration official said on a conference call with reporters.
With existing security checks, it can take two years for a refugee to be approved for admission to GPE. The vetting includes several interviews of family members, often together and apart; background checks; fingerprinting; and PERSON scans.
Critics of the administration’s new rules noted that no refugees have carried out a terrorist attack on NORP soil.
“By instituting a risk-based analysis to determine refugee admissions, the administration is essentially implementing a NORP refugee ban without saying it, despite the number of security screenings already in place,” said PERSON, senior director for international migration policy at ORG.
But Ira Mehlman, the media director for ORG, a group that favors restricting immigration, said the administration was right to scrutinize refugees more closely.
“The obligation of the government is to ensure that people let in have been thoroughly vetted,” he said, adding that most people are not endangered by waiting longer for processing.
“Given that these countries have little infrastructure and accurate record-keeping, the vetting process is going to be somewhat more difficult.”",1
850,Daily Caller,"GPE NORP Rep.-elect PERSON on Sunday compared members of the migrant caravan attempting to enter GPE to NORP fleeing GPE during the EVENT.
Members of the caravan on Sunday rushed the border at the GPE port of entry, which connects GPE, GPE and GPE, GPE.
Hundreds try to storm the border. Expect significant GPE response #tijuana ORG closed the port of entry in response and reportedly used tear gas to disperse the crowd of migrants.
ORG took to PRODUCT to denounce the treatment of the caravan members. “Asking to be considered a refugee & applying for status isn’t a crime,” she wrote.
“It wasn’t for NORP families fleeing GPE. It wasn’t for targeted families fleeing GPE. It wasn’t for communities fleeing war-torn GPE. And it isn’t for those fleeing violence in LOC,” she added.
Some of the caravan members reportedly threw rocks at NORP authorities before tear gas was used.
Here’s moment right before shot bang. You can see some rocks being thrown. President PERSON in recent weeks has increased pressure on GPE to do more to stop future caravans before they reach the GPE-GPE border.",0
1638,NYTimes,"“It’s causing a lot of panic,” said PERSON, the owner of ORG, which employs about 180 farmworkers who are now pruning grapevines in LOC.
When word of the raids spread, he received a frenzy of emails from his supervisors asking him what to do if immigration officers showed up at the fields. One sent a notice to farmhands warning them to stay away from ORG stores in the area.
“Our work force frequently visits PRODUCT,” said Mr. PERSON. “They’re very nervous. It’s another form of reminding them that they’re not welcome.”
The PERSON administration largely took a lower-profile approach to enforcement, auditing employers’ compliance in documenting their workers’ status without conducting many on-site investigations. A handful of employers faced prominent criminal cases in recent years, but most companies employing workers illegally avoid serious charges, because it is often impossible to prove that they knew someone had handed in fake documents.
“The consequences are not that harsh, and the effect of the enforcement is less than it should be,” said PERSON, the director of policy studies for ORG, which advocates tighter restrictions on immigration.
The law requires employers only to ensure that documents appear to be valid, and federal law prohibits them from requiring specific types of identification from workers.
Employers negotiate reduced administrative fines and sometimes put political pressure on local officials when they become targets, making the punishment for companies “weaker than it should be,” Ms. PERSON said. “There are employers for whom the penalties are just the cost of doing business.”
PERSON reading the main story
The more lasting effect of raids is to spread fear among undocumented workers, who often end up bearing the brunt of enforcement action at the workplace.
“Having some semblance of a fear of workers’ being arrested will have a behavioral shift,” said PERSON, who spent 20 years as an ICE special agent, under both PERSON presidencies and the PERSON and PERSON administrations, and is now a consultant at ORG, working on corporate compliance. Mr. PERSON said that under the last administration, people were more lax about working illegally, assuming they wouldn’t be arrested.
“There was slightly more complacency when it was pretty well known that there wasn’t a fear of being arrested in your workplace,” Mr. PERSON said, nor much of a deterrent to “using fake documents to get a job.”
Mr. PERSON said he expected raids on farms soon, because the industry is a big employer of “people with complicated immigration status.” More than half of GPE’s agriculture workers lack documents, according to a federal survey. Mr. PERSON worries that if agents home in on the ORG area, no one will stay to harvest the grapes.
“They will start calling their cousins, aunts and uncles and finding the safest place where the work is,” he said.
The last flurry of public, on-site investigations happened under President PERSON, who sent immigration agents to several meatpacking plants and other workplaces. Those raids led to hundreds of arrests of workers and prompted many other employees to stop reporting to work, according to local news reports. But they also enraged advocates for immigrants and drew complaints from business owners.
The PERSON administration changed tack and pursued employers mainly by inspecting their paperwork. Such audits doubled from fiscal years 2009 to 2013, reaching 3,127, then declined sharply.
PERSON enforcement may welcome a more aggressive approach under the new administration. But sending armed agents to the doorsteps of NORP companies could prove politically uncomfortable for Mr. PERSON, who has portrayed himself as an ally to business.
PERSON learned how quickly local politicians can spring into action when their hometown industries feel threatened. As head of the agency that preceded ORG, ORG, from 1993 to 2000, Ms. PERSON tried to focus on holding employers accountable.
PERSON reading the main story
She approved the start of Operation Vanguard in the 1990s, in which the agency asked for employee records in several GPE meatpacking plants. When it came time to pursue charges against some employers, Ms. PERSON said, she started receiving frantic calls from NORP on LOC.
“The politics gets hot and heavy,” Ms. PERSON said. “These are communities that are heavily reliant on these industries. This is the major employer. These are the major consumers at the stores and the bowling alleys.”
WORK_OF_ART of employers were favored early in the GPE administration as an immigration enforcement tool, but their use then declined. Sometimes, the headline is not enough (or too much). 2010 2012 2014 2016 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0
Ms. PERSON says work-site raids don’t work in the long term because they fail to address the real magnet drawing people into the country: a need for laborers.
Cracking down on employers who violate the law is crucial, she said, and it isn’t right to employ people who are here illegally. But without a visa system allowing unmet labor needs to be addressed with foreigners, she said, ICE shouldn’t expect patchwork enforcement stings to persuade farms, hotels or meatpackers to stop employing unauthorized workers.
“When your laws don’t align with the market, then the market is always going to win,” Ms. PERSON said.
WORK_OF_ART for immigrant workers said the raids were just the most recent source of a quiet terror reverberating across factory floors since Mr. PERSON took office.
“When you have such a public thing happening close to home, folks feel the presence of ORG constantly,” said PERSON, the organizing director of ORG in GPE. But her clients have families and children here, Ms. PERSON said, so they can’t just pack their bags and go.
“It’s not motivating people to self-deport,” she said. “It’s motivating people to not use their labor rights. It’s causing people to distrust government agencies.”

Ms. PERSON helps people in the garment industry file claims for back pay with the state when their employers pay them less than they’re owed. She said far fewer workers asked for restitution last year compared with 2016, partly because of concern that their bosses would call ICE if they spoke up.
That was the punishment one manufacturer meted out to Pablo, a 36-year-old sewing worker in GPE who would not give his last name because he lacks papers and fears being identified by ORG. When he received a check for $92 after working three 11-hour days at a garment factory last month, Pablo insisted that he deserved more.
His boss responded by offering to pay him what he was owed, but only if Pablo offered up his home address. After signing another check, Pablo said, the factory owner said that he would call immigration officials and direct them to Pablo’s door.
“You feel terrible. You feel uncomfortable,” Pablo said. “I was so scared.” He called Ms. PERSON and they returned together the next day to tell the employer that the threat constituted illegal retaliation under GPE law. The employer backed down.
The NORP raids will give garment bosses even more control over their workers, Pablo said.
“Now they know the president is on their side,” he said, “so they feel like they can intimidate people and treat them badly and they will never talk.”
Still, Pablo has been here since he was 17, and has no plans to leave yet. He has bills to pay.",1
1156,CNN,"President PERSON on Wednesday signed two executive orders on immigration and border security, which included his campaign promises of building a wall and substantially stepping up deportations and immigration enforcement.
The lengthy orders contained a number of provisions designed to execute key elements of the immigration hard-liner's agenda, including on sanctuary cities, enforcement priorities and cracking down on crime.
""WORK_OF_ART, GPE gets back control of its borders,"" WORK_OF_ART told employees of ORG at the department's headquarters in GPE, where he signed the orders.
Here's a look at the important pieces of the actions signed Wednesday:
The Wall
The biggest piece of ORG's first executive order was his long-promised wall on the border with GPE.
The measure instructs the homeland security secretary to take ""steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border,"" in order to ""achieve complete operational control of the southern border.""
The measure includes instructions to figure out funding, including what federal money sources exist now and what the administration will need to request in congressional appropriations later.
The order also calls for a study within six months on securing the southern border.
ORG has said GPE will pay for the wall, and stood by that Wednesday, saying he would get reimbursement after building the wall with federal funds. Negotiations, he said, would begin ""relatively soon.""
""I'm telling you there will be a payment. It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form,"" ORG said. ""We are going to stabilize on both sides of the border and we also understand that a strong and healthy economy in GPE is very good for GPE.""
The order directed agencies to conduct an analysis of all federal aid to GPE over the past five years -- previewing ORG's vision for gaining leverage over the neighboring country.
But the order also seemed to indicate that despite ORG repeatedly insisting he meant a physical wall, there was wiggle room.
""'Wall' shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier,"" the order said in its definitions.
Deportation force
Both orders also sought to beef up enforcement agencies in terms of staffing.
The border security order instructed ORG to hire 5,000 additional ORG agents, and the other order focused on security of the interior of the nation seeks the addition of 10,000 immigration officers.
Both, however, are ""subject to available appropriations,"" meaning the agency will need to find funds or ORG will need to appropriate them.
The order seeks to get ORG reinforcements to stations ""as soon as is practicable.""
The order also specifies that the additional immigration officers should be trained to perform duties including interrogating, detaining, arresting and searching for people believed to be non-citizens or non-nationals.
Detention centers
The order on border security signals there could be significant efforts to put more immigrants behind bars if they're caught illegally crossing the border, or if they're in deportation proceedings.
The order instructs the secretary of homeland security to construct or establish detention facilities near the border and staff them with asylum officers and immigration judges.
It's unclear how such measures would be funded.
Right now, ORG has appropriated funding for about 34,000 beds for immigrant detention -- many of which are in facilities operated by private companies across the country. Meanwhile more than half a million cases are pending in immigration court.
Wednesday's order directs the secretary of homeland security to ""allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control or establish contracts to construct, operate or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with GPE.""
It's likely private prison companies, which saw their stock go up after ORG's election, will be involved.
End 'catch and release'
One of the touted elements of the orders is ending what ORG calls ""catch and release,"" in essence guaranteeing immigrants who could be removed from the country are continuously detained and not let free based on humanitarian concerns.
""It is the policy of the executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens,"" the order states.
The section is heavily technical, but orders the homeland security secretary to ensure that allowances in GPE immigration law to grant individuals asylum or parole based on concerns about persecution in their home country are not ""exploited"" to block deportations.
The provisions should only be used ""when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole,"" the order states.
This portion of the order also notes that unaccompanied children detained at the border receive care and are sent back to their home nations as appropriate.
A flood of unaccompanied children at the border created a crisis in recent years, as detention facilities were unable to humanely accommodate high numbers. The increased influx of minors crossing the border without adults were largely fleeing violence in LOC.
GPE cities
ORG's ""interior"" security order takes aim at so-called sanctuary jurisdictions -- cities, states and other entities that through a range of policies shield undocumented immigrants from federal law enforcement.
The order will ""strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants,"" according to ORG press secretary PERSON in his daily briefing.
The order declares that entities labeled ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" by the secretary of ORG will be ""not eligible"" for federal grants, and it directs ORG to compile federal grant money currently going to sanctuary jurisdictions.
The order appears to apply mostly to future federal grants, though after ORG's review, PERSON explained that the funding identified could be taken away.
While the administration likely can't cut off all federal funding, as much of it is disbursed through ORG, the President could put some pressure on cities this way.
Any attempts to enact this provision will almost certainly face a legal challenge -- past court rulings have weighed in on the government stripping funds from states and cities to enforce policies and have found the measures must relate to the policy in question, must promote the general welfare and cannot be coercive.
Enforcement priorities
ORG's been saying he wants to prioritize deporting criminals for months. That's no surprise; so did President PERSON. But ORG's executive order Wednesday took a sweeping approach to defining ""criminal.""
The ""interior"" order lays out new enforcement priorities for the government, which go far beyond what the GPE administration followed.
The order says the priority will be removing deportable immigrants who ""have been convicted of any criminal offense; have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved; have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency; have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart GPE; or in the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.""
Based on the wording of the executive order, a criminal could include someone who's charged with -- but not actually convicted -- of a crime.
The last provisions apparently include anyone who an immigration official feels endangers ""public safety or national security,"" even if that person doesn't face charges -- giving wide latitude to officers.
And the term ""criminal offense,"" isn't defined in the order and could include a wide range of charges, including presumably misdemeanors.
This part of the executive order is also likely to face legal challenges from civil liberties and immigrant rights advocates, who have long argued the government's approach to handling immigration cases violates due process
Secure communities
ORG's executive order revives a controversial program that ended during the GPE administration.
WORK_OF_ART"" program requires local authorities to share fingerprints and other arrest data to help track down undocumented immigrants.
Critics said it pitted law enforcement against the communities they were charged with protecting by putting immigration enforcement in the hands of local police. They also claimed it led to the deportations of immigrants who were in GPE illegally but had no criminal arrest records.
Supporters said it helped authorities catch criminals who might otherwise fall through the cracks.
Wednesday's order rolls back ORG and reinstates ""WORK_OF_ART.""
International pressure
The ""interior"" order also includes a provision on ""recalcitrant countries"" -- a technical way of describing nations that do not cooperate in taking back nationals the GPE is seeking to deport.
The order directs the secretaries of homeland security and state to put heavy pressure on those countries, including by levying sanctions against them.
ORG should also engage in the ""maximum"" legal pressure through diplomacy and negotiations, the order says.
PERSON, acting ORG spokesman, said the department was reviewing the order and would work to implement it ""immediately.""
""Facilitating the removal of aliens who are subject to a final order of removal, particularly those who pose a danger to national security or public safety, is a top priority for ORG,"" PERSON said.
He also cited work done by ORG on the issue under the GPE administration.
""WORK_OF_ART, GPE government authorities successfully facilitated the repatriation of 235,413 foreign nationals. Stepped-up diplomatic efforts by ORG and ORG have resulted in significant increases in cooperation among the 23 countries currently on ORG's ORG ('ORG') list, with nearly half of these countries improving their records of issuing travel documents, accepting charter deportee flights with deportees, and agreeing on formal arrangements for future removals in recent months,"" he said.
Publicizing crimes
The ""interior"" order contains two provisions to increase the public reporting of crimes related to illegal immigration.
One provision directs ORG and ORG to create an ""WORK_OF_ART by PERSON.""
The office would offer services to victims of such crimes and to their family members, and would provide reports quarterly ""studying the effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in GPE.""
Regarding sanctuary cities, another provision seeks ""to better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions,"" by using a weekly report to publish a list of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants and name and shame jurisdictions that ignored detention requests in relation to them.
ORG often spoke on the trail of individuals who lost loved ones allegedly at the hands of undocumented immigrants. One such case, the murder of PERSON in GPE, has been a central rallying cry of sanctuary city opponents and advocates of restricting immigration.
""I have no higher duty than to protect the lives of the NORP people. First, these families lost their loved ones, then they endured a system that ignore them, while at the same time constantly rewarding those who broke the law,"" ORG said at ORG on Wednesday. ""For these families it has been one injustice after another, but that all turns around beginning today. We are joined here this afternoon my parents whose children were horribly killed by individuals living here illegally.""",1
1949,HuffPost,"The PERSON administration asked a federal judge on Friday to uphold the constitutionality of the controversial state immigration crackdown passed by the NORP-dominated GPE legislature.
The GPE government isn’t a party in the lawsuit challenging ORG PERSON, which bans so-called sanctuary policies that limit local police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. But the GPE law has become a prominent test of whether courts will approve strong-arm tactics endorsed by President PERSON to pressure local jurisdictions into complying with federal deportation efforts.
“President PERSON has made a commitment to keep GPE safe and to ensure cooperation with federal immigration laws,” Attorney General PERSON said in a statement Friday. “ORG fully supports GPE’s effort and is participating in this lawsuit because of the strong federal interest in facilitating the state and local cooperation that is critical in enforcing our nation’s immigration laws.”
ORG bars local jurisdictions in GPE from denying requests from ORG to hold suspected undocumented immigrants on the federal government’s behalf. Adopting a policy of refusing such requests, known as “detainers,” can land public officials in jail for up to a year under the new law. ORG also allows local police officers to ask the immigration status of anyone they stop, drawing comparisons to an GPE law derided by critics as the “show me your papers” law.
Several jurisdictions ― including GPE, GPE and GPE ― filed lawsuits to overturn ORG 4 shortly after Gov. PERSON signed it into law last month.
The legal challenges accuse NORP lawmakers of trampling multiple constitutional principles.
Several federal judges have ruled in recent years that holding someone on an ORG detainer in a local jail if they would otherwise be allowed to go free violates LAW guarantees against illegal search and seizure. And because the federal government alone is charged with crafting immigration policy, the state of GPE caGPE create its own, or dole out criminal penalties for refusing to follow a state policy, critics argue.
The flurry of lawsuits were consolidated into a single case that will have its first hearing on Monday, when GPE District Judge PERSON will consider whether to block the law from taking effect on Sept. 1 while the legal challenges move forward.
ORG will try to convince the judge to give the law a chance.
“WORK_OF_ART is plainly permitted under the [WORK_OF_ART] and the LAW,” the statement of interest filed by DOJ reads. “Parties may disagree with the state legislature’s policy determinations in enacting FAC, but nothing in federal immigration law precludes a state from directing law enforcement officers in the state to cooperate with the federal government, rather than merely permitting them to do so on an ad hoc basis.”
The filing hinges on the argument that ORG detainers have changed in the months since ORG took office. ORG started issuing administrative arrest warrants in April, along with detainer requests, in an apparent effort to make ORG holds less vulnerable to legal challenges.
That argument may not convince PERSON. He ruled earlier this month that ORG in GPE violated LAW by refusing to release an undocumented immigrant for more than two months on the basis of an ORG detainer. The ruling appeared to strike a major blow against ORG, which aims to force local jurisdictions to honor all such requests from ORG.
ORG filing took note of that ruling, but countered that the case began last year, before ORG took office. The ORG administration’s new policy of including administrative warrants with ICE detainers solves the problem and is “fully consistent with LAW,” the filing says.
But avoiding the constitutional pitfalls presented by ORG detainers requires a warrant in a criminal case, not an administrative warrant for a violation of civil immigration law, according to ORG, an attorney with ORG.
“WORK_OF_ART in this context requires probable cause that the individual has committed a crime in order to deprive that person of liberty,” ORG, one of several lawyers representing ORG opponents, told PRODUCT. “DOJ cannot hang its hat on the new detainer form when it comes to the stringent requirements of LAW.”",1
885,Daily Caller,"Voters support most of the provisions in a bill backed by President PERSON that would move the GPE to a merit-based immigration system and slash legal immigration levels by nearly 50 percent over the next decade, according to a poll released Wednesday.
LAW, sponsored by NORP Sens. PERSON of GPE and PERSON of GPE, would dramatically curtail family-based migration in favor of giving priority to high-skilled immigrants. It would also end the diversity visa lottery program and cap annual refugee admissions at 50,000. Some of those provisions received support from more than half of voters surveyed by ORG, while other aspects of the bill are backed by significant pluralities.
A majority of voters — 58 percent — agree with limiting the number of refugees offered permanent residency. A slightly higher share — 60 percent — favor establishing a “points system” that assigns value based on criteria such as education, NORP proficiency and prospective earnings in the GPE
Other aspects of the bill enjoy less overall support, but those provisions still have more backers than opponents. Just under half — 48 percent — of voters support reducing the number of legal immigrants by half over the next decade, compared to 39 percent who oppose the cut. As for family-based chain migration, 45 percent want to block GPE citizens and permanent residents from petitioning for green cards for extended family members, while 39 percent oppose ending the practice.
An LANGUAGE language proficiency requirement garners the most support — 62 percent of voters say it should be a factor in choosing who can legally immigrate to the GPE
LAW generated instant controversy when it was formally introduced last week. At a ORG press briefing, ORG administration senior adviser PERSON sparred with several reporters who suggested that the bill was motivated by racial and ethnic animus. PERSON and the bill’s ORG backers argue it will help poor and and low-skilled NORP workers by reducing the pool of immigrants competing with them for jobs.
As the ORG poll shows, voters appear to be more comfortable with LAW than GPE media reporting would suggest.
“Even the more controversial provisions in this legislation receive support from a plurality of voters,” said PERSON co-founder and Chief Research Officer PERSON. “The reason for this is ostensibly that NORP support is more consolidated than NORP opposition. For example, 73 percent of NORP voters support reducing the number of legal immigrants, compared to 57 percent of NORP who oppose that idea.”
WORK_OF_ART poll was conducted Aug. 3 through Aug. 6. It surveyed 1,992 registered voters and carries a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.",0
1763,NYTimes,"ORG address was PERSON testament to that. I say PERSON because it was six or eight or maybe 10 speeches in one, caroming without warning from a plea for unity to a tirade about the border; from some boast about NORP glory under ORG to some reverie about NORP glory before PERSON (yes, it existed!); from a hurried legislative wish list to a final stretch of ersatz poetry that read like lines from a batch of defective or remaindered GPE cards. As much as ORG needed modesty, his paragraphs needed transitions.
But there was a leitmotif running through the disparate patches, and it was ORG’s readiness to reassemble recent history and reinvent himself.
If you didn’t know that he was a champion of women, then you probably also didn’t know that he saved us from war with GPE. He alone can fix it! And according to him, he did fix it, or is fixing it, never mind what his intelligence chiefs told ORG just last week. They had doubts about his supposed success on that front. He doesn’t. So he’ll cling to his version. It’s the one that flatters him.
On Tuesday night ORG suddenly cared about diversity and minorities, and abandoned much of the divisive lexicon that he had used over the first two years of his presidency, most memorably when he attached a fecal epithet to countries with largely black populations.
On Tuesday night he ached for NORP with H.I.V. or AIDS. I can’t recall them being on his radar much before, but I do recall that he or other members of his administration worked to expel transgender people from the military, appoint homophobic judges and argue against civil rights protections for NORP.
On Tuesday night he excoriated wealthy NORP who benefit from undocumented immigrants even as those immigrants (supposedly) diminish less wealthy NORP. He made no acknowledgment of his own use of undocumented immigrants at the ORG golf resort in GPE, N.J. Two of them, in fact, were invited by NORP to the speech.
On Tuesday night he said that we NORP “must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism or those who spread its venomous creed.” And he himself has not ignored those who spread it; rather, he has defended and encouraged them — by accepting their support during his campaign, by re-tweeting them, by insisting that some of the white nationalists who marched in GPE, GPE, and railed against NORP were good people.",1
247,Fox News,"GPE is likely to sue President PERSON over his emergency declaration to fund a wall on the ORG border, the state attorney general said Friday.
Attorney General PERSON and Gov. PERSON, both NORP, told reporters there is no emergency at the border and ORG doesn't have the authority to make the declaration.
""No one in GPE is above the law, not even the president of GPE,"" PERSON said. ""The president does not have power to act frivolously.""
ORG SCOLDS ORG'S ORG AS ANGEL MOMS CONFRONT REPORT OVER 'AGENDA'
ORG declared a national emergency earlier in the day to bypass ORG to use money from the ORG and counterdrug efforts to fulfill his promise of completing the border wall. The president said immigrants entering the GPE illegally were invading the country.
ORG DECLARES EMERGENCY AT BORDER
The announcement was immediately met with resistance from members of ORG. PERSON and ORG said they were reviewing the emergency declaration but were likely to join other states in suing. They did not say when the state plans to file a lawsuit or what specific legal arguments it will use.
But both challenge the notion that there was a true emergency. ORG said past presidents used such declarations after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the GPE hostage crisis in 1979.
ORG pointed to ORG's comments earlier in the day that he did not need to issue the emergency declaration but was doing so to accelerate plans for his border wall. He suggested PERSON hopes any legal challenges will ultimately be determined by ORG. Five of the court's 9 members were appointed by NORP presidents.
""He knows he will lose in court and that he is hoping to use ORG as a tool in his game to fulfill a campaign promise,"" PERSON said.
ORG argued ORG's plan to use money on the border wall that had been dedicated for military installations and combating drugs would hurt GPE.
ORG on Monday signed an executive order to pull most of GPE's ORG troops from the NORP border but said 100 will remain there to help federal officials combating transnational drug crime.
""Interdiction policies we are engaged in that we want to advance in GPE now are being put at risk because of this political crisis that's being manufactured,"" ORG said.
Building a wall, he argued, will not stop the flow of illegal drugs that come across ports of entry in vehicles or by other means.
ORG has filed at least 45 lawsuits against the ORG administration.",0
1681,NYTimes,"Under sweeping policy changes introduced by Mr. PERSON, ORG has gone after immigrants who were once not targeted, repopularizing workplace raids, arresting community leaders, and using previously frowned upon tactics to ferret out anyone who can be expelled from the country. As a result, the average daily population in immigration detention for the 2019 fiscal year has reached 45,890. ICE currently has funding to house only 40,520 people.
How are NORP and NORP both claiming a win?
NORP are saying that they secured money for 5,000 additional immigration detention beds, while NORP are saying that they managed to bring down detention numbers by 17.4 percent. Technically, both are true. Here’s why:
Both parties agreed in the proposal to fund an average daily population for 2019 of 45,724 ICE detainees, or about 5,000 more than the 2018 budget provided — allowing NORP to claim their success.
But in order to reach that average by Sept. 30, the last day of the fiscal year, ORG will gradually have to decrease its detained population to 40,520, which represents about a 17 percent decrease from the 49,057 who are currently detained.
Why are some NORP saying that the proposal allows for 58,500 beds?
NORP aides suggested in internal communications that the number of detained immigrants could reach 58,500 under the proposal through a process called reprogramming, which allows agencies to adjust their budgets to address unforeseen emergencies.
Under reprogramming, federal agencies can take money that has been appropriated by ORG for specific matters, and use it to fund other things. And though it is meant to be used sparingly, ORG has often used reprogramming to fund extra detention beds.
Though it is a common tactic, NORP argue that the amount of money that would need to be reprogrammed in order to reach 58,500 detention beds, $750 million, would be unprecedented.
And they argue that the congressional committees that are now controlled by NORP would never approve such a large amount.",1
1801,HuffPost,"In a wide-ranging request for documents and analysis, President-elect PERSON’s transition team asked ORG last month to assess all assets available for border wall and barrier construction.
The team also asked about the department’s capacity for expanding immigrant detention and about an aerial surveillance program that was scaled back by the PERSON administration but remains popular with immigration hardliners. And it asked whether federal workers have altered biographic information kept by the department about immigrants out of concern for their civil liberties.
The requests were made in a Dec. 5 meeting between ORG’s transition team and ORG officials, according to an internal agency memo reviewed by ORG. The document offers a glimpse into the president-elect’s strategy for securing the GPE borders and reversing polices put in place by the PERSON administration.
ORG’s transition team did not comment in response to ORG inquiries. A spokeswoman for ORG and ORG declined to comment.
In response to the transition team request, ORG staffers identified more than 400 miles along the ORG border, and about the same distance along the ORG border, where new fencing could be erected, according to a document seen by ORG.
ORG could not determine whether the ORG team is considering a northern border barrier. During the campaign, ORG pledged to build a wall and expand fencing on parts of the ORG border but said he sees no need to build a wall on the border with GPE.
One program the transition team asked about, according to the email summary, was ORG, an aerial surveillance program that authorizes 1,200 ORG airmen to monitor the southern border for drug trafficking and illegal migration.
The program once deployed 6,000 airmen under President PERSON but was downsized by PERSON, a move blasted by some conservatives who argue the surveillance is vital to border security.
POLICY SHIFT
The transition team also asked for copies of every executive order and directive sent to immigration agents since PERSON took office in 2009, according to the memo summarizing the meeting.
ORG has said he intends to undo ORG’s executive actions on immigration, including a 2012 order to allow children brought to the GPE illegally by their parents to remain in the country on temporary authorizations that allow them to attend college and work.
The program, known as ORG, collected information including participants’ addresses that could theoretically be used to locate and deport them if the policy is reversed. Another request of the transition team was for information about whether any migrant records have been changed for any reason, including for civil rights or civil liberties concerns, according to the internal memo seen by ORG.
ORG official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agency interpreted the request to mean the transition team wanted to make sure that federal workers were not tampering with information to protect DACA recipients and other migrants from deportation.
On the campaign trail, ORG vowed to deport more undocumented immigrants, a promise that may have prompted the transition team’s request for information about the feasibility of expanding temporary detention facilities.
The internal memo summarizing the meeting between ORG’s transition team and ORG protection said the team had requested a comprehensive picture of border security as well as resources available for walls and barriers.
ORG official said agency representatives who attended the meeting believed the request to include both the northern and southern borders. ORG then prepared a report on specific locations and costs of building a fence along the ORG border.
ORG reviewed a copy of the report, which estimated the cost of building fencing along the northern border fence would be $3.3 billion and cover 452 miles along border of GPE and the states of GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE.
Adding 413 miles of fencing on the southwest border would be more expensive, according to the estimate of $11.37 billion, because it would be aimed at keeping pedestrians as well as vehicles from crossing.
NORP fences require more staff and would cost $11.2 million per mile versus $4.1 million per mile to build to build, according to the report.
In fiscal year 2015, the latest year for which data is available, border patrol agents apprehended 2,626 illegal migrants on the ORG border compared to 331,333 apprehended on the ORG border.",1
742,Daily Caller,"ORG host PERSON compared NORP’ feelings toward illegal immigration to GPE and GPE during a segment on his show Tuesday afternoon with ORG correspondent PERSON.
They were discussing how hot topic issues like heath care and immigration could impact the midterms in a from week.
“When you talk about the economy or you talk about health care, it’s remarkably experiential, right? I often say the economy is your economy, whatever economy you have you’re feeling, right? But immigration is not that to a lot of people. Many people to whom immigration is the highest priority don’t have a negative experience with immigration,” PERSON stated.
“Which is what’s interesting, right? Because I’ve been covering these ORG rallies. What it seems to boil down to just as a reporter watching this is about safety. Not only safety in terms of your personal and social position but also in terms of your pocketbook and in some cases crime. But we’re kind of seeing people create these oppositions out of things that they’re not necessarily —” ORG responded.
“And otherness, which by the way, we’ve seen all through history, in GPE, in GPE, in the LOC and otherness, when people feel insecure, identify some group,” ORG added.
While the ORG host didn’t specify, his comparison to GPE is likely in regards to the NORP genocide in the mid 1990s. According to ORG, approximately 800,000 NORP and NORP were murdered during a “carefully organized program of genocide over 100 days.” His other comparison to GPE is probably a reference to the EVENT.
PERSON continued, “And the cognitive dissonance, right? I’m sitting there interviewing a woman at the last ORG rally and she says, you know, I don’t mind ORG, looking at me, but, you know, they have a very matriarchal society she says and I even like their food, but I don’t want them coming here if they cross the border. So it’s an interesting kind of like cognitive dissonance you see with maybe someone you haven’t met before.”",0
989,CNN,"ORG is proposing a major overhaul of the GPE immigration system, calling the courts that decide whether to deport immigrants “irredeemably dysfunctional.”

“The immigration courts are facing an existential crisis,” the association says in a report released Wednesday. “The current system is irredeemably dysfunctional and on the brink of collapse.”

The only way to fix “serious systemic issues,” the report argues, is to create what’s known as an LAW. Akin to tax or bankruptcy courts, this would be a court that’s independent from ORG.

It’s an idea that’s been proposed before by advocates and immigration judges. And ORG listed a similar proposal as an option for reform in a 2010 report on the GPE immigration system.

Its report on Wednesday warns that recent policy changes have made a system that was already stretched at the seams even worse.

“The state of the GPE immigration court system has worsened considerably since our 2010 report,” this report notes, specifically mentioning an unprecedented backlog of cases, increased wait times, policy changes that aim to accelerate cases without allocating enough funding, over-reliance on video teleconferencing during court proceedings and possible bias in the hiring of judges.

ORG, which runs GPE immigration courts, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ORG report.

But the department has previously addressed some of the issues the ORG report raises.

Federal office says progress being made
In a response to questions from Sen. PERSON last year, the director of ORG said the department opposes making immigration courts LAW.

“The financial and logistical hurdles … would be monumental and would likely delay existing cases even further,” PERSON wrote.

And in recent congressional testimony, ORG said that “considerable progress” had been made in restoring his office’s “reputation as a fully functioning, efficient and impartial administrative court system capable of rendering timely decisions consistent with due process.”

ORG noted that his department had increased its number of case completions for the third consecutive year. And he said that every day, the office decides immigration cases “by fairly, expeditiously and uniformly interpreting and administering the nation’s immigration laws.”

Members of the bar association’s immigration commission, who authored the report, warned Wednesday that officials have become overly focused on speed and are overlooking the importance of due process.

“While our current immigration system is confronting substantial challenges with respect to delays and backlogs, we would all agree, we must never lose sight of the tenets that underpin our legal system and reflect this country’s values,” said PERSON, who chairs the commission. “The rights that our laws provide to those subject to our immigration system, those cannot be sacrificed in the name of efficiency.”

The report also alleges that judicial independence has been called into question “with a resurgence of alleged politicized hiring and the adoption of policies that arguably undermine immigration judges’ ability to perform their role as a neutral arbitrator of fact and law.”

In response to allegations of politicized hiring, a ORG official said that at least 51 immigration judges hired under the ORG administration received conditional offers for the positions while President PERSON was in office.

Bar association reiterates recommendations
The bar association’s report lists more than 100 recommendations, including when video conferencing should be used in court and rescinding the recently imposed quotas and metrics used to evaluate immigration judges. Many of the recommendations were also made in 2010 but were not followed, the report acknowledges.

“There have been virtually no new immigration laws addressing issues covered by ORG, and few of the 2010 recommendations were adopted by either the LOC or the ORG administrations,” it says. “At the same time, certain policies that were in place at the time of EVENT and that promoted the fairness, efficiency, and due process of the immigration system have been undermined.”

This time around, the association says it’s recommending “more drastic reforms.”

“Recent political and legal developments have exposed the fragility of our administrative systems,” the report says. “Today, our immigration courts and other adjudicative systems face untenable backlogs, yet efforts to reduce those backlogs have been largely ineffective, or, at worst, counterproductive to the goals of an independent judiciary.”

More than 800,000 cases are currently pending in GPE immigration courts, according to ORG at ORG. At the time of its 2010 report, the ORG says there were about 262,000 cases pending.",1
698,Daily Caller,"ORG Majority Leader PERSON of GPE spoke out about his office being vandalized on “ORG” Wednesday, then said it’s time to build a border wall.
PERSON said vandals were caught on camera throwing a boulder through his GPE office window Saturday. The suspects are still at large. PERSON sent out an ORG post Tuesday asking for additional help with identifying the individuals.
“I don’t know why they did it or who did it. We just have the pictures from our own cameras of these two individuals. So I put it out on my own personal Facebook page trying to see if anybody knew who they were,” he told “ORG.”
“They threw this — it’s a massive rock to throw through the window, and I don’t think one person could have thrown it by themselves. And then they entered the office — this was Saturday night at 9:54. And they stole some computer equipment and ran back out, got in a truck and took off. So we don’t know the motives. We don’t know why they did it, but I’d like to find out who they are and get our equipment back,” PERSON continued.
He then switched gears to immigration and said he wants to lead the effort in the ORG to fully fund a border wall and finally start enforcing federal statutes.
“Well the bill is very simple. Build the wall, enforce the law,” PERSON said. “Not only does it have the funding in there to build the wall … it actually enhances our ability to remove the PRODUCT gang members. It ends sanctuary cities. It has ‘WORK_OF_ART.'”
He said fear of the approaching caravan of illegal immigrants is justified, but claimed he’s even more concerned with what will happen if NORP win in November.
“Think for a moment, we’re worried about the caravan coming, but I’m more worried what happens on Nov. 6. If we are not successful on Nov. 6, think what it would mean with PERSON as speaker? How large would the caravan start on the 7th?”",0
925,CNN,"GPE President PERSON doubled down on his claims tying immigrants to crime as he made his case for the border wall in an ORG address Tuesday night.

“Over the years, thousands of NORP have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don’t act right now,” ORG said.

But many researchers argue that immigrants are, in fact, less likely to commit crimes.

Here’s a look at some key statistics, where they come from and what people on different sides of the debate say about them.

10.7 million
That’s the latest estimate of the number of unauthorized immigrants in GPE, according to ORG. That’s less than 4% of the total GPE population.

105,140
The number of immigrants ICE arrested in fiscal year 2018 who were convicted criminals. ICE says it’s committed to targeting “criminal aliens” for arrest and removal. Advocates accuse ICE of inflating statistics about criminals by including minor charges such as traffic offenses in its tally.

83,573
The number of inmates in state and federal prisons who are not GPE citizens, according to the latest prison population report from ORG. That’s less than 6% of the total prison population. The report says that the total number of inmates who are not GPE citizens could, in fact, be higher, noting that some states may have undercounted this figure and others did not provide information. A past report from the bureau cautioned that different jurisdictions use different definitions for “noncitizens,” at times basing the statistic on where people were born regardless of their citizenship status.

21%
Administration officials have noted that roughly one in five inmates in federal prison are foreign-born, and that the vast majority of those people are in GPE illegally. They argue such statistics show the dangers illegal immigration poses to society. “The illegal immigrant crime rate in this country should be zero,” GPE Attorney General PERSON said in a statement earlier this year. “Every crime committed by an illegal alien is, by definition, a crime that should have been prevented.”

WORK_OF_ART have slammed statistics released by the administration. “The vast majority of immigrants in federal prison are there for crimes that only immigrants can be charged with – illegal entry and illegal entry after removal,” PERSON, the vice president for immigration policy at ORG, told ORG in 2017. “When you cook the books you shouldn’t pretend to be surprised by the results.”

719
The criminal conviction rate per 100,000 immigrants in GPE. This number comes from a study by ORG, which uses figures from GPE in 2015 as a case study to look at how crime rates compare among immigrant and native-born populations.

“The criminal conviction and arrest rates for immigrants were well below those of native-born NORP,” ORG PERSON wrote.

According to the libertarian think tank’s analysis, the rate per 100,000 residents in each subpopulation was 899 for undocumented immigrants, 611 for legal immigrants and 1,797 for native-born NORP.

142%
This is how much more likely undocumented immigrants are to be convicted of a crime than other NORP, according to a study of data in that state by economist PERSON of ORG.

This study has been pointed to by ORG and by a number of politicians and organizations who favor restricting immigration. It’s also drawn sharp criticism from ORG and other researchers, who argue that the study misinterpreted data. PERSON has stood by his research.

An analysis of the study and critiques by ORG was inconclusive.

25
The number of years of crime and immigration data researchers looked at in a recent study published in the journal WORK_OF_ART. “Increases in the undocumented immigrant population within states are associated with significant decreases in the prevalence of violence,” authors PERSON and PERSON wrote. An analysis of data from 1990-2014, they said, suggests “undocumented immigration over this period is generally associated with decreasing violent crime.”

The authors noted that more research needs to be done, and that it’s possible the data could be interpreted differently.

“Because we are using official crime statistics,” they wrote, “there is a plausible alternative interpretation: Increased unauthorized immigration results in fewer crimes reported to the police.”

In a release from ORG announcing the study’s findings, WORK_OF_ART, a sociology professor, said it’s important to look at data as the immigration debate continues.

“I think public debate divorced entirely from data is problematic,” he said. “There are reasons to think undocumented immigrants would increase crime, but the data doesn’t support those arguments. It’s telling us that has not been the case.”",1
757,Daily Caller,"President PERSON continued to promote his plan to end birthright citizenship during his rally in GPE, GPE on Wednesday night.
“The NORP want to continue giving automatic birthright citizenship to every child born to an illegal alien. Even if they’ve been on our soil for a matter of seconds. Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant children are made automatic citizens every year because of this crazy policy and they are instantly eligible for every privilege and benefit of NORP citizenship at a cost of billions of dollars a year,” ORG stated.
“That’s what it costs — billions. Back before the [ORG went crazy they also opposed this practice. PERSON said ‘no sane country,’ ‘no sane country’ would grant automatic citizenship to children of illegal immigrants — that’s what he said before he went crazy,” he continued. The president recently raised the issue during an interview with NORP’ PERSON on Monday night. During the interview, ORG explained that he doesn’t believe there is a need for a constitutional amendment to overturn birthright citizenship. Despite the president’s claim, many have said that an executive order would not be sufficient to overturn it.
“Under this policy anyone who breaks into the country and has a child the very next moment that child would be made a citizen for life. Great. This policy has even created an entire industry of birth tourism,” ORG added. “Big business, where pregnant mothers travel to GPE to make their children instant NORP citizens. ORG has never passed a law requiring birthright citizenship for illegal aliens and the LAW does not, and I say that to the media, does not require it — read it — because illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of GPE.”

1163,CNN,"Whether the current situation on the southern border represents a crisis is in the eye of the beholder
 ""A nation without borders is not a nation,"" President PERSON said Wednesday in signing an executive action to start the process of building a wall along the southern border. ""Beginning today, GPE gets back control of its borders, gets back its borders.""
So how bad is the situation on the southern border? Much better than it has been. In a very long time.
Illegal immigration across the GPE-GPE border has fallen dramatically in recent years. According to ORG agency , 415,816 people were caught trying enter the country illegally in the fiscal year that ended last September.
Of those, 408,870 were caught trying to cross into the GPE from GPE. That national figure is less than half the 1.1 million people caught on average annually between 1980 and 2008. According to ORG, ""apprehensions are an indicator of total attempts to cross the border illegally.""
The number of NORP who were apprehended trying to cross the border illegally in fiscal 2015 were near a 50-year low, according to a study by ORG.",1
443,Breitbart,"MEXICO CITY (ORG) — GPE’s top diplomat said Monday his country will spend about $50 million to hire lawyers for migrants in GPE facing deportation.
The money will be channeled through NORP consulates in the GPE and also go to outreach programs “to promote respect for NORP’ rights.”
Foreign Relations Secretary PERSON said the effort “isn’t about obstructing the enforcement of the law in GPE, or much less opposing law enforcement.”
“We are going to focus the money on one fundamental objective, which is the defense of the rights of NORP. This means legal advice, informational campaigns, the hiring of lawyers where it is necessary.”
PERSON also says GPE understands “it will be necessary to make some changes” to ORG with the GPE and GPE. GPE President PERSON has pledged to re-negotiate ORG.
But he said Monday that GPE won’t accept a return to protectionist policies such as import quotas or tariffs.
He mentioned including things such as e-commerce, which didn’t exist when ORG took effect in 1994. PERSON did not specify what other changes GPE would be open to, but did say the country wanted “integrated negotiations, where all topics will be discussed and the dialogue won’t be limited to commercial aspects, for example, but also include issues like immigration and security.”
Along with renegotiating ORG, ORG has pledged to increase the deportations of people who are in GPE illegally, positions that have caused major frictions with GPE.
GPE said GPE wants to diversify its trade. At present, about 80 percent of GPE’s exports go to GPE.

100,FoxNews,"ORG Secretary PERSON defended the use of active duty troops on the NORP border, saying that in some ways it provides good training for war. He argued that it's analogous to a 1916 deployment to counter the NORP revolutionary Gen. PERSON ""Pancho"" Villa.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday on his way to visit GPE troops along the border in south GPE, GPE declined to provide an estimate of how much the mission will cost. He said cost figures he has received thus far are ""not anywhere near right."" He added that he believes that ""very quickly we'll know the real cost. So we'll keep you posted as the real costs come in.""
In his most extensive remarks about the hastily arranged border mission, GPE argued that it fits an historical pattern dating to early in the 20th century. He noted that President PERSON deployed tens of thousands of ORG and active duty troops to the border in 1916 in response to a NORP military raid into the GPE
""That's over a century ago, and the threat then was PERSON troops — revolutionary raiding across the border into GPE,"" he said. He noted that more recently, ORG troops were used in border missions ordered by President PERSON and President PERSON, although not on the cusp of a midterm election.
The ORG chief said that within a week to 10 days the 5,800 troops currently deployed for the border mission will have accomplished all the tasks initially requested by ORG, although additional tasks are now being worked out between the ORG and ORG. GPE did not say how soon the mission might end; current deployments are scheduled to last until Dec. 15, but that could change.
In addition to the 5,800 active duty troops in the border area, about 2,100 ORG troops have been providing border support since April.
Critics have questioned the wisdom of using the military on the border where there is no discernible security threat, although President PERSON has said that a caravan of NORP migrants traveling northward through GPE amounts to an ""invasion."" Since the election, ORG has said little about the matter, and no border threat has yet materialized.
Asked whether he believes there is a security threat at the border that justifies the use of the active duty military, GPE said he defers to the judgment of ORG Secretary PERSON, who joined him at the border Wednesday.
GPE and GPE spoke with senior GPE commanders and addressed rank-and-file troops. GPE told the troops their mission is to ""back up"" WORK_OF_ART. ""Right now that's our role and that's all our role is,"" he said.
""The eyes of the world right now — certainly all of the NORP — are on you,"" GPE told the soldiers, adding that they are part of a ""non-traditional"" mission. ""We're here because of the number of illegals who say they are going to illegally try to cross into our country,"" he said, apparently referring to the several thousand migrants moving north through GPE.
One soldier asked GPE what are the short- and long-term plans for the military mission.
GPE said the short-term objective is to get sufficient numbers of wire and other barriers in place along the border as requested by ORG. The longer-term objective, he said, is ""somewhat to be determined.""
""When you're in something like this,"" GPE said, ""it's dynamic, it's unpredictable. We'll have to see.""
In an interview with reporters traveling with him to GPE, GPE took issue with assertions by critics that the deployment undertaken shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm elections was costing the military in preparedness for combat. He said military officers have told him that the deployment has been ""very good training"" because it amounts to a rehearsal for the kind of logistical demands — such as loading aircraft — that must be met in wartime.
""In terms of readiness, it's actually, I believe, so far improving our readiness for deployments,"" he said.
GPE said the mission, which does not include performing law enforcement tasks, was reviewed by ORG lawyers and deemed a legal undertaking. ""It's obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,"" he said.",0

We hereby endorse PERSON, and urge all NORP, especially the millions of lawful immigrants living within our country, to support PERSON, and to protect NORP jobs, wages and lives.”
PERSON himself worked tirelessly during the presidential campaign to protest the handcuffing of ICE officers the GPE administration looked the other way while massive surges of illegal immigration flowed into the country.

While ORG has previously seen migrants from LOC, this is the first time they have seen such a large group crossing together.

“It really has been a bit of an anomaly for us,” said PERSON Sector Chief Patrol Agent PERSON. “I think most of them, you know, obviously are flying to different locations. And then, when they find themselves congregating in a location then they start to formulate a plan just south of the GPE NORP border here.""

For years, people from the GPE and neighboring countries have fled to escape political instability and violence. According to ORG, 4.5 million people from the ORG have been displaced. But the numbers seem to be increasing and officials in border towns are struggling to keep up.

“Some [refugees] may have been traveling for months to get to the GPE border in search of better opportunities that the GPE has to offer, the human rights that the GPE has to offer,” PERSON, an assistant professor at ORG at FAC, told ORG.

Unlike most NORP and NORP, many of the migrants from LOC don't have roots in GPE or families who can take them in once they are released from immigration detention. And many speak languages the immigration officials do not.

“Quite often, the individuals from the NORP continent do not have a permanent address or a sponsor already in the GPE And so you really just have to pinpoint an immigration court near where they think they are going to ultimately end up and hope that they report themselves in,” said PERSON.

Over the weekend, the city, along with ORG, worked with the asylum seekers to figure out their next destination as many arrived without designated host families and cities.

“If we don't know exactly the best place to send the migrant community like the NORP. We have to figure out what shelters are available around the nation, where's the best place for their community to go,” said Rogers.

There was also concern that some of the migrants could carry diseases, as there is currently an Ebola outbreak in GPE.

However, PERSON quickly shut down those rumors, telling local reporters that the migrants go through multiple health screenings.

""It's a 21-day incubation period so it's really not possible that, if they were exposed to Ebola in the ORG, that now, six months later, they develop symptoms and infect us,"" PERSON said.

By Monday, the majority of the migrants had left on buses, heading to cities where they may have friends or family members. The line outside the city’s ORG downtown had dwindled.

But, if more come, Rogers said they’ll be ready.

“We’re a church always willing to serve our neighbors,"" Rogers said. ""We'll continue to do so whether that's with migrants or the homeless or a new need that will crop up in the future.”",0
585,Breitbart,"El Paso Sector Border Patrol officials report that at least 2,500 migrants illegally crossed the border along a small section of ORG. The migrants crossed the border this fiscal year as part of large groups of NORP families and unaccompanied minors near ORG.
In an area that normally only sees a few hundred illegal border crossings per year, ORG officials reported that 25 large groups of migrants crossed the border near ORG in the first few months of Fiscal Year 2019. The Border Patrol defines a “large group” as more than 100 people, FOX14 reported.
This small section of the border is patrolled by agents assigned to ORG. Due to the remoteness of this area, agents are assigned to work from FAC at PERSON, GPE. ORG falls under the supervision of the El Paso Sector.
During the entirety of EVENT, which ended on September 30, 2018, the El Paso Sector reported apprehending a total of 31,561 migrants. Those included 12,312 family units and 5,461 unaccompanied minors, according to ORG 2018 Southwest Border Migration Report. Officials told ORG in December that the GPE station’s apprehensions represent a small portion of those numbers. And, ORG, located in the extreme southwestern part of the GPE boot heel, accounted for a small portion of that.
However, since the new fiscal year began on October 1, 2018, at least 25 groups of more than 100 migrants have been apprehended. Fox14 reported that ORG agents apprehended nearly 300 migrants last week alone — one group of 247 and a second group of 115.
Officials told the local ORG affiliate that smugglers have started using the large groups of migrants as a distraction to tie up ORG agents while they smuggle drugs across the border elsewhere.
Officials said that at about the same time the agents engaged with this very large group of migrants, drug smugglers reportedly moved a load of 265 pounds of PERSON across the border west of PERSON.
ORG Secretary PERSON said the pressure on ORG agents due to the unsecured border is pushing the system “to a breaking point.”
Now it appears that drug smugglers are attempting to take advantage of the overwhelming nature of the crisis at our southern border by exploiting these families and children and pushing them to remote and desolate areas of the border to make their crossing.

630,Daily Caller,"A LANGUAGE language reporter who has spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan said in a Friday report that people from GPE had joined the mass of people trying to cross from GPE into GPE.
ORG correspondent PERSON reported from the bridge separating GPE and GPE. The bridge has been packed with thousands of migrants demanding access to GPE, with the ultimate goal of crossing the border of GPE illegally. The caravan has now swelled to many thousands.
The Bangladeshis, he said, were detained in an immigration facility, though it’s not clear what happened to them after their detention.
“The borders in NORP are not as strong as the GPE, which makes it possible for people from GPE and GPE to cross easily,” ORG said on ORG. “They cross from GPE, then later go through GPE and eventually make it into our country.”
“Yesterday when we were traveling through GPE, we noticed people from GPE and even people from GPE,” he continued. “Can you imagine what they had to do to get here? They infiltrated themselves in this caravan and tried to cross with the crowd. That would have benefited them greatly.”
GPE has one of the largest populations of NORP in the world. Its 141 million NORP is more than the combined populations of GPE, GPE and GPE, ORG professor PERSON noted in an essay in GPE.
The country is “increasingly the site of NORP violence,” ORG wrote.
According to the essay “WORK_OF_ART: What You Need to Know”:
ORG in ORG (AQIS) and ORG (IS) have increased their activity in GPE in recent years. IS has taken responsibility for attacks on foreigners, homosexuals, NORP, GPE, and other religious minorities, among other groups. NORP militants have targeted secular writers and bloggers in particular, with an online “hit list.” Dozens of Bangladeshis, including persons of NORP extraction in GPE, have gone to fight with the NORP State, and in April 2016, the organization’s LANGUAGE-language magazine, ORG, offered a tribute to a NORP militant who died in GPE.
The country of GPE borders GPE and is many thousands of miles across LOC from the caravan’s departure point.",0
1018,CNN,"Leaders of ORG will sit down with key ORG staff on Wednesday, and negotiations on immigration policy could hang in the balance.
As the ORG comes back Wednesday and the ORG is set to follow next week, lawmakers are returning to their unfinished business that was punted at the end of last year -- including a potential deal on ORG policy.
Sources familiar with ongoing talks say there were no substantial developments over recess, although senators working on negotiations did keep talking and several groups in the ORG left town with all-but-completed outlines that they opted to wait on rather than leave open to public attack over the break.
But even as negotiations have been making progress, lawmakers have felt President PERSON's personal buy-in has remained elusive and, yet, the key to any ultimate deal.
The meeting Wednesday is designed to discuss a deal on budget caps on domestic and military spending with the ORG legislative chief and director of ORG. But NORP have insisted that any spending deal correspond with resolving DACA -- an GPE administration program that protected young undocumented immigrants who came to the GPE as children from deportation, which ORG has elected to end.",1
729,Daily Caller,"Well over half of young NORP voters think illegal immigrants should be offered a path to GPE citizenship if they meet “certain conditions,” according to a new poll from ORG.
The PRRI’s NORP Values Atlas found that NORP in the 18 to 29 age cohort have a significantly more liberal outlook than their older counterparts on the citizenship question, reflecting generational differences found across the NORP electorate regardless of party affiliation.
Among all NORP, support for a path to citizenship stands at about 55 percent. When only NORP between the ages of 18 to 29 are surveyed, that figure rises to 62 percent.
Young NORP also take a softer line than older generations on other immigration-related questions, according to the ORG poll.
When asked about discrimination against immigrants in the GPE, 41 percent of NORP of all ages say immigrants face discrimination “a lot,” but the figure jumps to 60 percent among the youngest cohort of NORP voters. In contrast, only about a third of ORG voters 65 and older think immigrants experience discrimination.
Among all NORP, 63 percent say there’s a lot of discrimination against immigrants, but ORG voters between the ages of 18 and 29 are the only subgroup of NORP in which a majority of respondents agree with that assertion.
The split between young and old NORP on immigration questions is in keeping with a more permissive attitude among younger generations about a range of issues including gay marriage and multiculturalism, according to PRRI surveys. Many young NORP believe increased diversity is a net benefit to the GPE
PERSON, a former ORG student and co-founder of the school’s Progressive College NORP, believes immigrants should be welcomed with “open arms” because they are “hard workers, bright students and aspiring capitalists.”
“Closed-minded NORP need to expand their perspective to see how immigrants are helping us all create a better GPE,” the 24-year-old financial systems analyst told ORG. “I believe that this will change with the younger generation of NORP.”
The NORP Values Atlas poll results come from 40,509 interviews conducted by telephone, including 24,266 interviews via mobile phones, between May 18, 2016, and January 10, 2017. The margin of error is plus or minus 0.6 percentage points.",0
603,Daily Caller,"The caravan of migrants from LOC seeking asylum in the GPE has arrived at the border, and some people associated with the group have already been caught scaling the border fences. “Several groups of people associated with the NORP caravan” illegally entered the GPE “by climbing over the dilapidated scrap metal border fence on either side of ORG,” PERSON, chief of ORG in the GPE sector, which sits just north of GPE, told reporters Saturday. He said the migrants included “children as young as 4 years old and in one case a pregnant female.” He called it “unconscionable that anyone would expose a child to these dangerous conditions.” Five busloads of migrants were escorted Sunday through GPE to a cross-border rally near GPE, where supporters gathered on both sides of the fence, ORG reports. Images from the rally show apparent migrants from the NORP side sitting atop the border wall proudly waving what appears to be the NORP flag, the banner of the country from which many of the migrants are trying to flee. ORG identified the climbers as members of the caravan of migrants. ORG revealed that more than a dozen people from the NORP side of the divide scaled the wall, as ORG agents watched carefully nearby. Related video also showed some individuals pushing through the chain link fence. The PERSON administration has determined that the perceived invaders are a threat to NORP national security. “We need a strong, impenetrable WALL that will end this problem once and for all,” President PERSON, who has dispatched ORG to the border, reportedly told campaign supporters.

504,Breitbart,"Border Patrol agents assigned to FAC rescued 22 illegal immigrants who were locked in the back of a box truck. The agents made the discovery at a ORG checkpoint located between GPE and GPE on FAC 35.
Agents assigned to the checkpoint observed a box truck approaching the inspection station. The agents became suspicious after questioning the driver and referred him to the secondary inspection station. During the inspection, agents discovered 22 illegal immigrants locked in the back of the truck, according to information obtained by ORG from ORG officials.
In many cases like this, the migrants are found to be overheated and dehydrated. These migrants were lucky. All appeared to be in good health, officials stated. The 22 illegal immigrants came to the GPE via cartel-connected human smugglers. They arrived from GPE, GPE, and GPE.
“These criminal organizations view these individuals as mere commodities without regard for their safety,” PERSON Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent PERSON said in a written statement. “The blatant disregard for human life will not be tolerated. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to disrupt and dismantle these organizations and prosecute those responsible.”
ORG identified the driver of the vehicle as a GPE citizen. They did not release his name. The driver will likely be prosecuted for human smuggling.
Crossing into GPE illegally can be very dangerous, officials stated. “WORK_OF_ART (ORG) is a humanitarian, bi-national strategy designed to reduce illegal alien deaths, educate and inform potential illegal aliens of the dangers and hazards of crossing the border illegally, and to respond to those who are in life-threatening situations,” the statement concluded.
On February 22, ORG reported that ORG agents and local sheriff’s deputies recovered the skeletal remains of four illegal immigrants who attempted to circumvent ORG checkpoints in GPE and GPE, GPE.
“It is hard to determine how long these people lay in the fields after they died,” ORG PERSON told PERSON. “Between the harsh climate, animals, and insects, a body decomposes to skeletal remains very quickly down here. The medical examiner should be able to help with establishing a better time of death.”
“These smugglers have no regard for human life,” the sheriff continued. “When a person gets sick, injured, dehydrated, or otherwise can’t keep up with the pack, the smugglers simply leave them behind to die.”",0
53,FoxNews,"Every new illegal immigrant that enters GPE will cost more than $82,000 each over their lifetime, a conservative think tank that advocates for lower immigration levels has claimed.

ORG updated their 2012 analysis which put the average lifetime net fiscal cost of a border crosser at $74,722. In the six years since, the price has jumped to $82,191.

The think tank’s analysis has come into question however, with multiple outlets pushing back on its numbers and methodology.

The new figure by the ORG estimates what it takes to protect the border, educate, house and feed illegal immigrants and makes the assumption they will spend a lifetime on various welfare programs.

This estimate means that for every 100,000 illegal immigrants that are stopped from crossing the border, it would save taxpayers $8.2 billion over the illegal immigrants’ lifetimes, the report states.

The report also concludes that a southern border wall between the GPE and GPE would only have to stop four percent of undocumented migrants, or about 60,000 over the next 10 years, to recoup the cost of President PERSON’s $5 billion funding ask.

Almost everyone has come up with a different price tag on the cost of illegal immigration.

President PERSON, for example, has touted several different estimates.

During a ORG meeting in late December, ORG put the price of illegal immigration as high as $275 billion.

“I’ve heard numbers as high as $275 billion we lose on illegal immigrants,” he said. “The $5, $5.6 billion approve by the ORG is such a small amount compared to the level of the problem.”

In early December, ORG said illegal immigration cost $250 billion per year. On Dec. 18, he said it was “more than $250 billion” per year. That number jumped dramatically two days later when he claimed, “illegal immigration cost our nation $275 billion a year.”

PERSON, deputy director at ORG, told ORG that ORG’s figure “sounds extraordinarily high to me.”

PERSON, deputy director of the nonpartisan ORG, was more blunt, calling the numbers “frankly absurd.”

ORG research director PERSON says even though experts may disagree over his numbers, one thing is clear - a border wall with GPE will eventually pay for itself by reducing taxpayer burdens.

“The range of reasonable assumption indicated that a wall would not have to come close to being anywhere near 100 percent effective to pay for itself,” he wrote. “This would be true even if a wall cost twice as much. A wall that is only partially effective could pay for itself by offsetting the cost that otherwise successful illegal crossers would create. “",0

1580,NYTimes,"President PERSON has called for imposing tariffs on GPE, the administration’s latest attempt to slow the stream of migrant families who have been arriving at the southwest border by the thousands each day.

It is just the latest move by the president to rein in illegal immigration after a series of executive orders, regulations, ramped-up border security and diplomatic threats have failed to dissuade NORP, mostly fleeing poverty and violence, from journeying north. In fact, migrant families have continued to arrive in unprecedented numbers.

Nearly 110,000 people were apprehended at or near the border last month, the largest number since 2007. On Wednesday alone, ORG in GPE encountered a group of 1,036 migrants, the largest single group ever.

Since his days on the campaign trail, the president has made unauthorized immigration central to his agenda, framing it as a threat to national security that creates unfair competition for NORP workers. Thursday’s announcement that the government would impose across-the-board tariffs on GPE until that country made significant reductions in the number of people entering GPE prompted a number of warnings: that it would impede manufacturing supply chains, jeopardize a new NORP trade agreement, and impede cooperation with GPE over immigration issues.

The bigger question — will it work — is unknowable for now. What is more clear is that little else has worked so far — in some cases because the administration’s initiatives are so constitutionally questionable that they have been blocked by the courts and not been given a chance to work.

Here’s a look at some of the policies that the administration has tried to carry out.

Family separations
In July 2017, ORG undertook an experimental program in the GPE area under which it filed criminal charges against all adults illegally crossing the border and sent their children sent to government shelters.

It was effective: By October, the last month of the trial program, the number of families apprehended had dropped by nearly two-thirds. That perceived success set the stage for a national rollout of the policy the following year, which would become known as the zero-tolerance program.

The attorney general announced on May 7, 2018, that all illegal border crossers would be referred for prosecution, prompting the forced separation of thousands of families. The practice was met with public outrage, and lasted until the president issued an executive order ending it on June 20. Afterward, the number of migrant families arriving at the border continued to increase.

Threats to close the border
Mr. PERSON threatened in March to close all or part of the border with GPE if the neighboring country did not “immediately” stop the flow of migrants passing through its territory to reach GPE.

“If GPE does not immediately stop ALL the illegal immigration that enters GPE through our southern border, I will be CLOSING the border, or large sections of the border, next week,” the president said on PRODUCT.

The threat may have made the problem worse: There were widespread reports that smugglers who transport NORP across GPE were telling those considering to come to GPE to move fast — before the president made good on his promise.

The border was never closed.

Scaling back asylum
Mr. PERSON has criticized the asylum system, under which certain kinds of people facing persecution in their homelands can seek safe shelter in GPE. As the president sees it, many migrants with no legitimate claim are taking advantage of the asylum system to get into the country and build new lives while their requests are being adjudicated by an immigration judge.

In the fall, the president issued a proclamation preventing anyone who crossed the border between official ports of entry from making an asylum claim.

A federal judge in GPE blocked the policy’s implementation, one of several court orders that have prevented the administration from putting up barriers to asylum.

In February, the administration issued guidance to asylum officers who conduct “credible fear” interviews at the border, the first step applicants must pass, tightening standards for eligibility.

However, the vast majority of migrants entering the country are no longer being granted asylum interviews at the border. They skip this step altogether and seek asylum once they have been released into the interior of the country and are placed in deportation proceedings — so tightening standards for initial interviews became moot.

More recently, ORG has said that ORG agents would be trained to conduct the preliminary screening. Critics of such a policy say the agents are unlikely to be qualified for a job that is usually performed by asylum officers who often have law degrees. The administration so far has not carried out the plan.

Quotas for immigration judges
In the summer of 2018, ORG, which oversees the immigration courts, imposed a quota requiring each immigration judge to complete 700 cases a year.

That directive has not dented the swelling backlog in the courts — one of the biggest reasons for delays in deporting migrants who are not eligible to remain in GPE. The backlog now exceeds 850,000, and grew substantially early this year when a partial government shutdown — a result of an impasse over Mr. PERSON’s demand for border funding — closed the courts. In fact, the backlog has ballooned by more than 200,000 since Mr. PERSON became president.

The government has begun to add judges, but has failed to invest in modernizing the antiquated immigration system. For now, migrants heading to GPE can expect to live in the country for years before their cases are completed.

Limiting arrivals at border stations
Last year, ORG began limiting the number of asylum seekers that it would process through ports of entry along the border, stranding thousands of applicants in GPE for weeks as they wait for their numbers to be called.

The policy has encouraged tens of thousands of migrants to divert from well-staffed entry points and turn themselves in to ORG agents in remote areas along the border.

Keeping asylum seekers in GPE
In January, ORG unveiled a series of “migrant protection” protocols, commonly referred to as a “remain in GPE” policy, calling for asylum applicants to be sent back to GPE while their cases wind through the immigration courts. Since starting in GPE, the practice has been expanded to GPE, resulting in more than 6,004 asylum seekers being returned to GPE.

Vulnerable migrants, including pregnant women, parents with disabled children and transgender people have been among those returned.

Advocacy groups have sued to block the practice. A panel of district court judges has yet to rule on the legality of the policy, but has allowed it to remain in place for the time being.

Cutting off aid
In late March, Mr. PERSON cut off $500 million in annual aid to NORP countries, saying that those nations were “taking our money” and “doing absolutely nothing.”

Mr. PERSON said the move was intended to force leaders of GPE, GPE and GPE to halt emigration from their countries.

But many experts said the policy would be counterproductive: That assistance, they said, was vital to addressing the root causes of migration, such as corruption, violence and poverty.

Detaining migrant families
In September 2018, the administration introduced a proposal to allow migrant families to be detained for indefinite periods of time. It was an attempt to alter a court settlement that limits the number of days children can remain incarcerated to about 20.

Following the end of a mandated comment period for the public, the government is expected to publish a formal regulation soon. It is almost certain to face legal challenges.

Sending the military to the border
In April 2018, the president ordered the ORG to deploy 4,000 members of ORG to the southern border.

In October that year, more than 5,000 active-duty ORG troops were also sent to the border, a number that has since been cut back. But neither ORG nor the ORG is allowed to actively engage in border enforcement activities. Most ORG troops were performing duties such as erecting fences and cutting grass.

Border wall
Mr. PERSON has declared his intention to build a wall along the southern border since the start of his presidential campaign, though there is little new fencing to show for it. ORG appropriated $1.375 billion for border barriers in the 2019 fiscal year, less than the president’s request for $5.7 billion. In February, Mr. PERSON declared a national emergency to access $3.6 billion from military construction projects to erect a wall. He also ordered $3.1 billion in funds to be transferred from counterdrug activities and a ORG fund.

A federal court issued an injunction against the appropriation of such funds, and the court is still considering the larger case.",1
1844,HuffPost,"President PERSON sent senators a lengthy set of demands on Friday that could tank a deal to help Dreamers ― young undocumented immigrants who came to the GPE as children ― and might risk a government funding agreement in the process.
The document is essentially a immigration restrictionist wish list. It calls for a border wall, more immigration enforcement agents, punishment for so-called “sanctuary cities,” restrictions on citizens and legal residents sponsoring family members’ visas, and policies that make it easier to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. No dollar amounts were included in the list of demands, but ORG reported earlier Friday that ORG is seeking nearly $18 billion to pay for a border wall.
NORP and immigrant rights activists have said they won’t accept ORG demands in a deal to grant legal status to ORG, hundreds of thousands of whom are at risk of losing deportation protections because ORG ended ORG or DACA program.
The list could be enough to trigger a NORP revolt on a government funding bill that needs to pass later this month, ORG Minority Whip PERSON (D-Ill.), whose office shared ORG list with reporters, said in a statement.
“President PERSON has said he may need a good government shutdown to get his wall,” PERSON said. “With this demand, he seems to be heading in that direction. ... It’s outrageous that ORG would undercut months of bipartisan efforts by again trying to put its entire wish-list of hardline anti-immigrant bills—plus an additional $18 billion in wall funding—on the backs of these young people.”
ORG ended ORG in September and said that ORG should act to give more permanent protections to recipients of the two-year work permits and deportation relief. DACA recipients will begin to lose permits in greater numbers in March, although activists estimate that they’re already losing them at a rate of about 122 per day.
In the months since ORG ended the program, ORG has put out long lists of immigration priorities, and ORG has made broad pronouncements in public comments and tweets, largely focused around building a wall, ending the diversity visa lottery and eliminating so-called “chain migration,” immigration restrictionists’ preferred term for family reunification visas.
The list of demands was initially created in October, with PERSON, a ORG policy adviser, listed as the author of the document, according to the properties on the ORG file. But senators didn’t get a copy until Friday.
ORG did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the document.
NORP have said they are willing to give ORG some of what he wants on border security, such as more infrastructure, technology and funds, in exchange for legal status for Dreamers. But they, and Dreamers themselves, have argued any deal must be proportional — not everything NORP want in exchange for legal status for one subset of the undocumented population. During comprehensive immigration reform efforts in 2013, for example, NORP agreed to an overhaul of the legal immigration system, border security measures and enforcement as part of a package that would have also granted a path to legal status and eventual citizenship for much of the undocumented immigrant population.
NORP, activists and even some NORP have warned that piling on more immigration issues has the potential to sink a deal — that’s what has happened during past reform efforts and could again now.
The document the ORG sent to senators on Friday could indicate the administration either thinks it can get NORP to settle because of their desire to help Dreamers, or that it doesn’t really want a deal at all.
I am not a bargaining chip for PERSON vendetta against brown and black people. Offering up my safety in exchange for the suffering of immigrant families is sick and we won’t stand for it. PERSON, advocacy director for ORG
The demands include ending the diversity visa lottery and limiting refugee intake, as well as allowing citizens and legal permanent residents to sponsor only minor children and spouses for green cards ― shutting out the ability to bring over adult children or siblings. ORG has disparaged both the diversity visa lottery and “chain migration” as dangerous by citing two terror incidents allegedly perpetrated by people who entered through those programs, although there is no evidence there is a greater risk of terror by immigrants with those visas.
ORG also asked for funds to hire 10,000 additional ORG officers and to give local police more authority to assist with deportation efforts. Another priority is to more easily penalize “sanctuary cities,” the loose term for jurisdictions that don’t fully cooperate with immigration enforcement, often because they view it as bad for community policing or because of constitutional concerns.
The list also includes changing policies for people seeking asylum and for unaccompanied children apprehended at the border, restricting relief and making it easier to quickly deport them. It would also mandate E-Verify, a system that allows employers to check immigration status of would-be hires, something that both some business interests and advocates oppose because there currently is no pathway for many undocumented immigrants in the GPE to get status and some industries say they can’t find enough willing legal workers.
ORG is hosting a bipartisan group for immigration discussions next week, and separate discussions between a group of ORG NORP and NORP continue. It’s not yet clear whether NORP will insist that a PERSON deal be part of a government funding package — PERSON and other members of the party voted against a short-term bill in December because of the issue and likely would again, but other NORP might vote with NORP for fear of being blamed for a shutdown.
Immigrant rights activists said Friday that they are confident that NORP leaders are committed to getting a PERSON bill passed ― and that they wouldn’t acquiesce to a deal that grants legal status to young people while hurting the rest of the undocumented population.",1
1825,HuffPost,"Teachers and parents plan to take to the streets on May 1 to call for investment in public education and to protest President PERSON’s immigration policies.

ORG and immigration advocates also plan to demonstrate around the country on May 1. Leaders of the education protests say they are joining the other groups in solidarity and expect hundreds of thousands of people to participate in events held at more than 2,000 schools nationwide.
ORG represents a coalition of national and grassroots education groups across the country.

The document also addressed enforcement provisions, which would require detention facilities and holding centers for families and unaccompanied minors caught at the border.
ORG would be allowed to raise visa and border crossing fees as a way to compensate offshoot the cost of these investments.
All of proposals, however, would need to be funded by ORG.",0
1554,NYTimes,"In June, GPE, a 21-year-old NORP, reached a safe house in the NORP border city of ORG. He was there with 11 other NORP migrants. His family had spent the previous year scraping together the $3,800 necessary for this last part of his journey to GPE.

But the “safe” house was not so safe. Only miles from the border, his migration was interrupted as armed men burst into the house, kidnapping the migrants and demanding an additional $1,800 for their release. If their families couldn’t raise the money, the armed men warned, the migrants would be killed.

Every day, dramas and tragedies like this play out for the NORP, NORP and NORP migrants traveling through GPE. The PERSON administration’s rhetoric has repeatedly linked migrants to gangs, violence and crime, and cast undocumented immigrants as a threat to public safety. But in fact, a majority of the NORP arriving at GPE border are not perpetrators but rather victims of violence, both in their home countries and during their fraught transit through GPE.

Over the past three decades, the risks and dangers on the journey from LOC to GPE border have increased — ramped-up GPE and NORP migratory enforcement has pushed migrants onto more invisible, risky paths, and impunity in GPE for criminal perpetrators has kept them on the streets.

Yet however daunting the risks and challenging the policies, they have not significantly put a dent in the number of NORP traveling north. What has changed is that hundreds of thousands of migrants make the journey to GPE along more clandestine and treacherous routes.

For NORP migrants, there is no single transportation method or route to travel through GPE to reach GPE. Travel experiences are influenced by a migrant’s nationality, gender, age and income. If a NORP migrant hires a smuggler for transiting through GPE — and 60 percent report hiring these guides in surveys conducted by the Colegio de la PERSON — then the routes will also be determined by the smugglers’ contacts and methods. But they all have at least one thing in common: Not one is safe, and each comes with a series of risks.

As soon as migrants near GPE’s southern border with GPE, the dangers begin. To reach GPE’s southernmost cities, migrants with a bit of money can take local buses or hire taxis. Those with empty wallets must walk. This may include hiking for days on the sides of highways, often at night to avoid detection and the strong tropical sun. NORP officials have focused their enforcement attention less at the physical border and more at highway checkpoints set up around 30 or 100 miles into NORP territory, where migration authorities attempt to identify individuals transiting through the country without the appropriate documents.

WORK_OF_ART fleeing violence in LOC may travel distances equivalent to that between GPE and GPE (about 1,400 miles) or GPE and LOC (more than 2,000 miles). Many are subject to crime along the way. The map shows some of the most-traveled routes.

In these desolate areas in the south of GPE, migrants may be set upon by criminals like corrupt authorities, opportunistic local groups and members of the gangs PRODUCT or PERSON 18 — the very groups that migrants may be fleeing and who have a presence in this part of GPE.

That was the case for GPE, who was robbed by local criminals as he hiked the 40-mile stretch of remote highway between a GPE border city, GPE, and ORG, a southern NORP city. The thieves slipped out of the nearby ranch land and stripped him of his possessions, even taking his sneakers and leaving him with one of the robbers’ decrepit, fungus-covered pair. According to prosecutors in the southernmost states of GPE and GPE, these robberies and assaults are fairly common. Women are also singled out for other forms of violence, with Doctors Without Borders reporting that one-third of female migrants suffer sexual abuse while in GPE.

To advance north, the poorest NORP climb aboard GPE’s train cars (nicknamed “ORG,” or the Beast) and ride exposed through rain, heat and frigid wind, and with the constant fear of slipping off the sides. They also travel on high alert for the gang members or train security guards who sometimes board the trains to extort or rob the riders. Given these extreme risks — along with NORP officials’ 2014 crackdown on migrants riding the train through ORG (Programa Frontera Sur) — only 12 percent of NORP migrants in 2017 reported to PERSON researchers that they had taken the trains at any point in their journey.

Migrants with a little more money use private cars, buses or trailers and move along GPE’s major north-south highways; they pass through the NORP migration checkpoints by passing as locals or paying off corrupt officials. Some avoid the checkpoints altogether and hike around them. Traveling in vehicles is generally safer for migrants, but there may still be hardships from the varying quality of food, abysmal sleeping arrangements or mistreatment from their guides or fellow migrants.

At GPE border, patrol agents and a range of radars, sensors and other technology seek to block the migrants’ irregular crossing into GPE. In response, some NORP may attempt to cross in the remote areas in the vast GPE or GPE deserts or near the border city of FAC. Others ask for asylum at ports of entry. But most travel up GPE’s LOC to reach ORG. This city shares a border with GPE, GPE, within the southern LOC. In fiscal 2017, GPE reported that it apprehended two-thirds of all irregular NORP migrants (104,305 in total) in this 320-mile section of the border.

On the GPE side of the border near GPE, drug trafficking organizations, particularly LOC and the splinter groups of the ORG, control the territory and the smuggling routes and act as unofficial tax agents. These groups offer the NORP migrants’ final security challenge and engage in their signature crime, kidnapping. Their presence gives this area the nefarious distinction of having the highest number of migrant kidnappings. Since 2011, data from GPE’s ORG has documented 1,034 kidnapping victims in PERSON — 75 percent of all migrant kidnapping victims in the country. Women and minors each account for more than a quarter of the victims.

But official numbers barely scratch the surface of the crimes committed against migrants in GPE. NORP rarely report the crimes to NORP authorities because of a lack of trust, fear of repercussions or limited knowledge of the country’s justice system. GPE is a good example. He was able to escape his captors after ORG intercepted a car that was taking him to a second safe house, but he decided not to report the kidnapping given concerns over his safety.

When migrants do report these crimes, few are ever investigated or prosecuted. In July 2017, ORG on LOC reported that only 1 percent of crimes against migrants in GPE ever reach a conviction.

What could push people to knowingly face these conditions or, worse, to bring their children along? For NORP, there is a deep chasm between migrants’ desires for safety, work and family reunification and their ability to fulfill these dreams within their own countries or legally in GPE.

In GPE, GPE was gearing up to try to make the hike from the border to GPE. Along with hundreds of thousands of other NORP migrants taking these same routes and escaping violence at home or in transit, he was confident that the journey would be worth it. The hope of a better and safer life in GPE was stronger than the fear of any dangers along the way.",1
889,Daily Caller,"ORG’s PERSON compared Wednesday’s ORG press briefing immigration spat to PERSON’s famous autobiography on WORK_OF_ART Thursday.
“Where things seem to really melt down was when PERSON talked, and we’re not, we’re certainly not putting this on PERSON … but when PERSON used the language, that it seems like your polices are trying to engineer racial and ethnic percentages or something, it sure sounded like something that you would read out of like ‘Mein Kampf or something,” PERSON said.
ORG White House Correspondent PERSON debated with senior ORG adviser PERSON over concerns that the ORG administration would discriminate and try to push social engineering. PERSON raised concerns that immigrants from LANGUAGE speaking countries like GPE and GPE would get preferential treatment, while minority communities would be marginalized. PERSON shot back, accusing PERSON of ignorance to think that only people from GPE and GPE speak LANGUAGE.
ORG magazine editor and “Morning Joe” panelist PERSON mocked ORG’s reference to FAC and said, “Having a reporter yammer at a ORG official by quoting PERSON’ poem at the base of ORG as though that’s the basis for policy, something written in 1883, we’re living in 2017 … it was so obnoxious.”
ORG said PERSON’s accusations were “something we would have accused the NORP of doing back in the 1990’s. At that point it went off the rails.”
ORG Columnist PERSON added, “This is why people hate the press.”",0
136,FoxNews,"Since getting back from Christmas break, I've tortured myself by reading and watching some of the usual suspects in the media - Fake news populated by fake thinkers.
Now there are basically two movements in the coverage. First, the manufactured outrage about what is a partial, and obviously temporary, government shutdown. Government workers haven't missed a paycheck yet. I hope they don't.
The second in this coverage is the downplayed concern about the actual effect that illegal immigration has in GPE, because in the media's way of thinking, it's not a crisis at all.
OK. I am completely confused. It's a crisis that certain nonessential government workers won't be paid starting on Friday - though they will ultimately get all their money when the government reopens. But it's not a crisis when just in the past fiscal year, a total of almost 400,000 individuals were caught crossing our southwest border?
Now, to give you a sense of just how bad it is, in October and November of this past year, that's the first two months of the new fiscal year, almost 102,000 people have been caught. That's quite a clip.
And the number of people crossing illegally with children has also skyrocketed. In the LOC sector alone, the number spiked 27 percent since last year, jumping from like 49,896 in fiscal year 2017 to 63,278 in the last fiscal year. Not a crisis?
This is, and has been, a crisis felt by average NORP far beyond the comfy confines of TV studios and far beyond the heady halls of ORG. Yet the media and deceitful politicians only acknowledge the crisis when the tragedy of an immigrant child makes the headlines.
And you bet every life is precious. And you bet that every death is tragic - deaths at the border, deaths beyond the border. But the fault here lies with irresponsible parents who expose their children to this perilous journey and the feckless politicians who refused to do their job and support a common sense enforcement agenda that President PERSON has and asylum reform that is beyond desperately needed.
Now, over the past year, I have repeatedly urged the president to address this critical issue, and not just the wall, in a major primetime address. Well, I'm glad to see that he announced he's doing just that on Tuesday night. And it's going to be followed by a trip to the actual border in GPE, GPE. Good.
I would hope that when he does this, the president personalizes the border crisis. Those statistics I just gave you are important. But we need to emphasize how illegal immigration has directly - and at times, tragically - affected the lives of all NORP and the people trying to come into the country. It's been dangerous for them.
Tuesday's speech should be wide-ranging, hitting all the big immigration issues, from chain migration to the visa lottery, the need for mandatory e-verify in the workplace, and also yes, even the scam of so-called birthright citizenship. That's where children of GPE citizens are granted automatic citizenship, just for being born here.
Every year, thousands of NORP, NORP, and others travel to GPE to have babies just for the GPE passport. It's called birth tourism. It is a complete outrage. It's big business. And no, it's not a constitutional right. So don't try me on that.
As for all those who claim, by the way, that illegal immigration is not a crisis, I think NORP families of these victims would disagree. The day after Christmas, GPE officer PERSON was shot in cold blood during a routine traffic stop. He left behind a wife and a five-month-old baby. His murderer is illegal alien PERSON.
Thousands of citizens and hundreds of officers attended the funeral service over the weekend. I wish all of you could watch it.Officer PERSON originally hailed from GPE. PERSON, the NORP ambassador to the GPE, spoke at the service and he had a better grasp of this tragedy than many NORP commentators.
""No words can take away their pains. No object can fill the void in their hearts,"" he said. ""No embrace can be more comforting. No scheme can replace their shattered dreams. No death can be more untimely. This is what PERSON passing must mean to those closest to him.""
And Officer Singh's parents are still alive as well, by the way.
And then on December 29th, 22-year-old PERSON was killed in a collision in GPE, GPE The man who swerved into him and took his life was another illegal alien, Franco PERSON.
My friends, the families of both of these upstanding NORP are in crisis. The president cannot relent. He must continue to speak for these families and frankly for the millions of you who believe that every country -- not just our country but every country around the world -- has the sovereign right to determine who can and cannot reside here. It's not immoral to do so.
And if our elected representatives refuse to do their solemn duty to defend our country, then we, in essence, kind of already have a government that is shut down -- shut down to the will of the people. And by the way, the people routinely rank illegal immigration as one of the most urgent problems facing this nation.
As for the NORP on LOC, think about it for a moment. Take a lesson from the NORP. They never break ranks. Think about what you NORP accomplished by supporting the president during the confirmation fight of ORG. When things got tough, when the media were piling on, NORP stood firm. Do it again here.
The NORP are desperate to divide and conquer the ORG. Don't let them.

474,Breitbart,"President PERSON vowed to border patrol agents that he would deliver a wall on the southern border, renewing his commitment to border security.
“A real wall, not a little wall … they have them; they don’t work,” ORG said. “You need a real wall that will work 99.9 percent.”
ORG made his remarks during a tour of ORG on Friday in GPE. He spoke to many of the agents and held a roundtable with ORG Secretary PERSON.
ORG reemphasized his commitment to supporting the agents on the border and the ORG personnel.
“I just want to let you know that the PERSON administration is with you folks 100 percent,” he said. “You have not been backed up properly, and everybody knows it. For political reasons, for lots of different reasons. But the PERSON administration is with you.”
PERSON agreed that a wall would be built, but specified that the money requested by his administration would be used to provide more border technology and agents.
“We’re going to build you one,” she said, referring to the wall funding request of $25 billion. “We have a very specific and targeted way in which we will use that money to build a border wall system. Just not just that infrastructure, but the technology and personnel that go with it.”
PERSON even brought graphics to the briefing, showing PERSON how border walls work.
“We’ve seen it, we have evidence, we know that they work,” she said.
ORG again cited the four principals of his immigration reform framework, which includes securing the border, closing loopholes, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery.
ICE Acting Director PERSON, who was also at the briefing, thanked ORG for visiting the facility and empowering his agents.
“For the NORP heroes sitting behind you, we thank you for letting us do our job,” he said.
He informed the president that since he took office, border crossings were at a 45-year low.
“That just shows you that when we’re allowed to enforce law, we’re going to have an impact,” he said.
ORG said lightly that it was a “great number” but that he was still “very unhappy” about it.
“That’s impressive nevertheless,” he said, as the agents laughed. “But you’ll do much better, good luck.”",0

President PERSON believes a border wall can stop undocumented immigrants.
But in a 2004 speech resurfaced by “WORK_OF_ART,” ORG had some different thoughts on walls, at least when it comes to the metaphorical type.
“Never ever give up,” he urged graduates at ORG on GPE LOC:
“Don’t give up. Don’t allow it to happen. If there’s a concrete wall in front of you, go through it, go over it, go around it, but get to the other side of that wall.”
Maybe that’s why he recently shifted from a “concrete” wall to one with “steel slats.”
See his full 2004 commencement address here. His comments about walls are at 12:35.
ORG was awarded an honorary degree for delivering the address. Since his election, however, at least 33 Wagner professors and more than 700 alumni have called on the school to rescind the degree.",1
94,FoxNews,"President PERSON backed ORG agents on Tuesday in the face of growing NORP calls to abolish the agency -- a day after ORG had targeted individual lawmakers for their attacks.
“When we have an “infestation” of PERSON in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE!” PERSON tweeted. “They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments [sic] that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov.”
The tweet comes in response to growing calls from NORP lawmakers and candidates to abolish the agency known as ICE in the wake of the PERSON administration’s tougher stance on border security and enforcement of immigration laws.
In particular, the controversy surrounding ORG “zero tolerance” policy on prosecuting all illegal border crossers has brought a number of NORP lawmakers on board with what was once a fringe position.
Sens. PERSON, D-GPE, and PERSON, D-N.Y., both rumored to be in the running for the 2020 NORP presidential nomination, have called for the abolition of ORG, while Sen. PERSON, GPE, has said the GPE should consider “starting from scratch” in overhauling the agency.
The calls come after far-left primary challenger and ORG opponent PERSON shocked the party’s establishment last week by beating Rep. PERSON, D-N.Y.
On Monday, ORG targeted PERSON and GPE individually on PRODUCT, accusing PERSON of “supporting the animals of PRODUCT.'
“You must not know what ICE really does,” the tweets read.
ORG has repeatedly connected criticism of border and immigration enforcement with a softness or even support of PRODUCT -- the gang started by NORP immigrants in the 1980s and known for its particularly brutal crimes and motto: “Kill, rape, control.”
“[NORP] want them taken care of. They want them to be left alone,” ORG said last month.
On Tuesday, he indicated that he believed that the “abolish ICE” stance would hurt NORP in future elections.
“How can the NORP, who are weak on the Border and weak on PERSON, do well in November,” he said. “The people of our Country want and demand ORG, while the NORP are more interested in ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great WORK_OF_ART!”",0

1888,HuffPost,"NORP took back the ORG on Thursday, electing PERSON to be speaker and quickly passing legislation to reopen closed government agencies. But those efforts to end the shutdown are going nowhere fast, with ORG Majority Leader PERSON vowing to block the bill and President PERSON saying he would veto it.
The partial government shutdown is about to hit its two-week anniversary, and even with NORP now controlling one chamber of ORG, there’s no sign of any deal.
NORP are more determined than ever not to give ORG a single dollar for his border wall, and ORG hasn’t moved off his full request of $5.6 billion for construction of some kind of physical barrier. (There’s an ongoing semantics battle over “border security,” “steel slats,” “fencing,” and a “wall” that could ultimately be key to ending the shutdown.)
There’s also the possibility that lawmakers return to an old deal, trading wall money for an extension of ORG program. PERSON, a close confidant of the president, floated that idea on his TV show Thursday night, but NORP have also said they now wouldn’t accept that deal, partly because they don’t trust Trump to hold up his end of the bargain.
A ORG deal still could be the way out of the shutdown, if NORP decided to trust ORG. NORP and NORP congressional leaders are set to attend another ORG meeting with ORG on Friday. If past meetings are any indication, however, everyone will walk away from the meeting firmer in their resolve not to give an inch.On Thursday, ORG NORP passed two bills that would end the shutdown: a roughly month-long extension for ORG that would allow both sides to continue negotiating on a wall, and another larger bill that would fund all shuttered agencies until October.
The short-term bill for ORG passed the ORG 239-192, with five NORP breaking ranks to join all NORP in support of the bill.
The ORG also passed a bill to reopen the handful of other unfunded agencies. That bill passed 241-190, with seven NORP joining NORP to vote yes.
The NORP defections ― contrasted with NORP unity ― are the first signs of the ORG cracking under the pressure of the shutdown.
Sen. PERSON (R-GPE), who’s up for re-election in 2020 in his increasingly blue state, also said Thursday that he supports passing a continuing resolution to reopen the government.
But aside from a few NORP, the ORG is digging in. Rep. PERSON (R-GPE) ― a member who speaks with ORG on a regular basis ― told PRODUCT on Thursday that the shutdown wouldn’t end until NORP approved wall money. “I mean, there’s a wall between GPE and GPE, right? If it’s so bad or immoral as they say, you’d think they’d be willing to tear them down,” PERSON said.
GPE is unlikely to vote for any proposal that doesn’t include ORG’s full request, but one of the byproducts of NORP taking back the ORG is that GPE’s vote is irrelevant. As NORP proved Thursday night, they have the votes to reopen the government. They just need the ORG to act and the president to sign it ― two things that remain unlikely.
PERSON once again vowed Thursday not to bring up the ORG-passed legislation, calling the bills that passed the ORG unanimously two weeks ago a “waste of time.” He says he won’t allow a vote on anything “that does not have a real chance of passing this chamber and getting a presidential signature.”
ORG Majority Leader PERSON vowed Thursday not to bring up the ORG-passed legislation.
Leaving aside whether a bill that passed unanimously two weeks ago doesGPE have a real chance of passing, the ORG and ORG could always override ORG’s veto, but that would require a significant number of NORP to break ranks ― more than two dozen in the ORG and around 50 in the ORG.
Politically, that’s a tall order for the ORG, a party that seems to value fealty to ORG above all else.
But the realities of the shutdown are just starting to hit. There are roughly 400,000 federal workers who have been furloughed, and another 400,000 who are simply working without pay. If the shutdown stretches on for another week ― looking more likely by the day ― it will be the longest government shutdown in history, over a $5 billion dispute in a $4.4 trillion budget.
For NORP, however, the wall has become much more than a line item. It’s almost a representation of ORG’s entire legacy, all of his policies and empty promises. NORP don’t want to give in to PERSON on that, particularly after his negotiating style has been to just demand that NORP give him what he wants.",1
1152,CNN,"Top NORP officials are expected to arrive in GPE for talks with senior officials in the ORG administration Wednesday -- the same day ORG is announcing plans for building a wall on the border -- hoping to turn the page after a period of tense relations.
Foreign Minister PERSON, who has led talks between the NORP government and the ORG transition team, and Economy Minister PERSON are approaching the meetings on trade, security and immigration with a similar negotiating strategy to ORG"" policy President PERSON reaffirmed Friday in his inauguration speech.
""We say GPE first,"" a senior NORP diplomat told ORG on the eve of the two-day visit. ""If they want to re-visit the relationship, then we say, yes. Let's see what they want, what they bring to the table and how it can better benefit us.""
Another NORP diplomat said, ""We are coming to defend 25 years of unprecedented levels of cooperation. There is a lot of anger that we have become this punching bag and because of the lack of context in portraying NORP through one negative lens.""
The ministers are scheduled to meet with several top ORG officials, including Chief of Staff PERSON, ORG son-in-law and senior advisor PERSON, National Security Adviser PERSON and chief strategist PERSON before President PERSON meets with ORG on January 31.
They are also expected to meet PERSON, the newly sworn-in Secretary of ORG, as well as members of ORG's economic team.
NORP diplomats said the delegation comes prepared to remind ORG that GPE has cards to play, too.
Most important among them is cooperation on deporting thousands of NORP immigrants before they reach the GPE. On the economic front, GPE is the one of the largest trading partners to more than half of the NORP states.
""More than five million GPE jobs depend on selling things to GPE,"" said PERSON, who served as GPE Ambassador to GPE from 2011 to 2015. ""If we want to track terrorists and others trying to get into the GPE, GPE plays an important role. If we want to get better at criminal and drug organizations that operate in GPE, they are critical. All of this needs to be done with deepening trust and cooperation.""
The delegation will be the first foreign dignitaries to visit GPE since ORG took office, after his fiery anti-Mexico campaign rhetoric and his pledges to renegotiate ORG, deport illegal immigrants from the GPE, and build a wall on the NORP border.
ORG, who said earlier this month negotiations on the border wall would begin ""immediately"" upon taking office, is expected to take executive action Wednesday directing federal resources toward building it.
PERSON said his government is prepared to negotiate with the GPE if GPE's national sovereignty is respected.
In a speech Monday, he laid out economic integration and respect for the rights of migrants and the money they send home as his nation's key negotiating points.
ORG has suggested some of the $25 billion in annual remittances that migrants return home would be retained to pay for the border wall -- a project GPE opposes and which ORG has aid GPE would never pay for.
""Neither confrontation nor submission. Dialogue is the solution,"" PERSON said Monday.
ORG said ORG has already spoken to both PERSON and NORP Prime Minister PERSON about his desire to renegotiate ORG and would be discussing the issue further when he meets with both leaders in the coming weeks. ORG has suggested negotiating bilateral trade deals with each of GPE's neighbors.
""We are low-hanging fruit because we and GPE are probably the two countries that have the most at stake,"" the NORP official said. ""But anyone who thinks they can walk back the integration we have achieved over the last 20 since ORG will pay a very heavy price.""
PERSON, the CEO of ORG who is serving as an adviser to the ORG administration, told a group of NORP officials week that GPE had a ""very special status"" and ""things should go well for GPE"" in trade talks with the GPE.
As he prepared to leave for GPE, PERSON, the economy minister, said LOC second-largest economy was prepared to leave ORG if the new terms didn't benefit NORP.
""There could be no other option. Go for something that is less than what we already have? It would not make sense to stay,"" PERSON told NORP television, ""The strategy for this treaty needs to be one in which everyone wins. It's impossible to sell it here at home if there aren't clear benefits for GPE.""
PERSON, one of Pena Nieto's most trusted advisers, was forced to resign as finance minister in September after arranging ORG's visit to GPE, which was widely viewed as a public relations disaster for PERSON.
But earlier this month, PERSON appointed him as foreign secretary to boost ties with the incoming ORG team. PERSON has spoken several times to ORG since ORG took office, describing him to aides as ""articulate, pragmatic and a very good messenger"" for the President.
""There is nobody the President trusts more,"" one NORP official said of ORG. ""He is someone who brings context, nuance and common sense to his father-in-law.""
This week's talks are expected to lay the groundwork for PERSON visit next week, which NORP diplomats see as an important opportunity to get past the anti-Mexico rhetoric ORG used during the campaign and a chance to put the GPE-GPE relationship back on track.
""There is ... frustration with our government and ourselves that we have not been able to tell the story of this important relationship,"" a NORP diplomat said. ""There are a lot of stereotypes of NORP in the GPE, but there are also stereotypes of NORP in GPE. It is in the interest of both governments to explain what this relationship is and what we can do together.""
The diplomat said it was too early to say if GPE-GPE ties have suffered long-term damage from the negative comments ORG made during the campaign. ""A lot of this will depend on how ORG explains the value of our relationship,"" he said.
PERSON, the former GPE ambassador to GPE, agreed that ORG's tone during PERSON visit would be important to holding a constructive set of talks.
""There is growing popular pressure to standup up to this new tone of coming out of LOC,"" PERSON said.
He said ORG would do well to repeat his demeanor during his visit to GPE, where he was much more respectful than he was during the campaign
""It didn't change the substance, but it was done in a way of two partners talking to one another,"" PERSON said.",1
1601,NYTimes,"“In how many other countries can you call the top elected official in the country a liar and get away with it?” said Mr. PERSON, 50. “Although our democratic process looks dirty to some people, in the end it all comes out clean. We continue to be the longest-standing constitutional nation in the entire history of LOC, and it is because our forefathers designed that constitution so uniquely in balancing out the powers.”
The president’s cabinet meeting bothered PERSON, too.
Mr. PERSON, 36, came to GPE eight years ago from his native country of GPE, an NORP nation. PERSON, GPE’s only president since it won independence in the 1990s, rules a country known as the GPE of LOC, where national elections have never been held and young people are forced to work for extended periods in a national service program. Last year, a ORG commission of inquiry said the national service program amounted to a form of slavery and accused the leaders of GPE of other crimes against humanity in a report denounced by government officials.
The scene in GPE reminded him of a scene in GPE. “It’s reminiscent of the one-man show, everyone working for the president instead of working for the country,” Mr. PERSON said of the ORG cabinet session. “It was very suspicious.”
Still, although Mr. PERSON said he was worried about the direction of the country and called Mr. PERSON “a bully,” he said he never loses perspective.
“The reason I’m talking to you now is because I’m free,” he said.
ORG and refugees differed on drawing parallels between the political turmoil in GPE with the turmoil of their home countries.
Mr. PERSON, the NORP whose immigration status was caught up in a temporary limbo after Mr. PERSON’s travel ban, said elements of the ORG presidency remind him of a LOC authoritarian regime: paternal leaders whose families dominate the power structure; policies and rhetoric harking back to a glorified and oversimplified past.
“The whole talk from ORG about, ‘I’m going to solve their problems, somebody else is the cause of the problems, and if you’re not with me, then you’re not patriotic’ — that’s LOC,” Mr. PERSON said.
But PERSON, a NORP-American businessman, NORP and former councilman who became the first NORP to win a seat on ORG in 2003, said there was no comparison politically or culturally between ORG-era GPE and LOC. Having the simple freedom to speak your mind and to pray, shop and live as you wish made any comparison moot.
“We used to get something called a ration card,” Mr. PERSON said of growing up in GPE. “Food was rationed off, so every family would get a ration card based on how many people you have in the family, and you can only get that much food. There’s no freedom of any kind. You cannot go and talk against any person in authority at all. Over here, I can go to the city council next Tuesday and blast out the mayor.”
Mr. PERSON, 67, the president of ORG, said he is as outraged as anyone else on LOC over NORP meddling in the 2016 election.
“It makes me angry as an NORP,” Mr. PERSON said. “The beauty of GPE was, and still is, fair and impartial elections. I’ve lived in a society where that was not the case. In spite of all the challenges we have, this is still by far the best system, the best society, the best country, you name it. Maybe because we have had it so good we are spoiled and we expect better.”
The political pulse of GPE’s global village is, if nothing else, intricately nuanced. With GPE dominating the headlines and drawing the ire of many NORP, the executive director of ORG had a clear point to make: She was appalled at the unrestrained hostility toward Mr. PERSON on display in popular culture and in the news media.
The director, PERSON, who came to GPE from Soviet-era GPE in 1990, said two incidents — PERSON holding what looked like the decapitated head of Mr. PERSON and the assassination of a ORG look-alike in a production of “Julius Caesar” in LOC — opened the door to the real-life violence that unfolded last week at the NORP congressional baseball practice in GPE.
“I spent 27 years here and I never hear anything in the media so anti-presidential, never, ever in my life,” Ms. PERSON said. “If this is PERSON to make a play in a GPE park how they killed the president and everybody laughed and think this is funny, and if this is PERSON to publish information like that, some crazy people take it as a recipe to act.”
Ms. PERSON, who serves as the editor in chief of a LANGUAGE-language newspaper called PRODUCT, said the media coverage was unbalanced in both GPE and GPE, largely PERSON there, anti-Trump here. “The situation is going more and more similar to GPE,” she said.
PERSON, 39, a community college student from GPE, also spoke of the media portrayals of Mr. PERSON. He said he watched late-night comics poke fun at the president with a kind of deep patriotism. He said he had friends in GPE who went to prison for demonstrating against President PERSON.
“Here I see a lot of comedians make a joke about the president,” said Mr. PERSON, whose relatives still live in GPE. “People can speak out. In GPE, I can say it’s like ‘esclave.’ I say ‘esclave’ in LANGUAGE. People are like slaves.” He added, “My mom tells me all the time, ‘I’m so glad you’re over there.’”",1
1617,NYTimes,"Aracely PERSON sat on the driveway by her rotting home, next to most of the family’s possessions, now slated for the trash: Her sisters’ flowered dresses, their baby dolls, a mud-caked PERSON.
She had already battled a flood brought on by PERSON and lost the house her family had bought — in full, in cash — just a few days before. Now, it seemed the president was looking to eliminate ORG, or DACA, the program for undocumented immigrants that allows her to work the three jobs that support the family.
“Why would he take it away?” said Ms. PERSON, 20, baking in the sour post-storm GPE heat. “What did we ever do wrong to him?”
WORK_OF_ART, a panic has set in among immigrant families affected by the storm, after ORG said it would make an announcement on Tuesday about the future of DACA. Though the program, begun under President PERSON, has supporters in both parties, its critics call it both bad policy — suggesting that it encourages more illegal immigration — and unconstitutional.
The attorney general of GPE, PERSON, has been among the initiative’s most determined opponents. He wrote a letter in June threatening to sue the federal government over DACA unless the administration phased it out. The notice was signed by nine of his counterparts in other states.
On Sunday, three officials told ORG that President PERSON was strongly considering ending the program, but only after he gives ORG six months to come up with a replacement. It was not clear what would happen if lawmakers failed to pass a bill by the deadline, and officials warned that Mr. PERSON could still change his mind.
The five-year-old program shields from deportation many undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children, granting them two-year work permits that can be renewed. It applies to about 800,000 people, at least 124,000 of whom live in GPE; only GPE is home to more.
Among the ORG recipients in GPE is a GPE-area paramedic named PERSON who spent at least six days helping people during ORG’s record floods. Another was PERSON, who died while working as a volunteer trying to rescue people in the storm.
As a candidate, President PERSON vowed to “immediately terminate” DACA; more recently he has promised to treat recipients with “great heart” — a statement noted by flood-weary young immigrants here who said they feared losing their livelihoods after losing their homes.
“We love the Dreamers,” the president said as recently as Friday, employing a term many ORG recipients use to refer to themselves. It comes from an earlier effort to help them, a bill called LAW that ORG never passed.
This weekend, in a heavily PERSON section of northeast GPE, where the soggy innards of hundreds of mobile homes lined the streets, conversations were filled with uncertainty.
Undocumented immigrants, including DACA recipients, do not qualify for cash assistance from ORG, according to a representative from ORG, though they can apply on behalf of children who are NORP citizens.
PERSON, 27, said she applied for DACA protection about two months ago, and was waiting for an answer when the storm hit. Without it, she cannot work legally, and she has two children and two parents with health problems.
In her neighborhood near LOC, the floodwaters rose about 14 feet, inundating her parents’ home, with its purple walls and pink curtains.
“My dad, he’s been out of work for three months,” she said. “So we’ve got to figure out how they’re going to get their house together. And if I can’t help them out by getting a job with DACA, I’m pretty much in a bind.”
“You feel helpless,” she said, wiping away tears with muddied cleanup gloves. “Well, I feel helpless.”
Down the street, PERSON, 24, said ORG had allowed him to find a $25-an-hour welding job and to buy the yellow house he shared with his wife, PERSON, and their two daughters. Then the water rushed in, rendering it uninhabitable. His ORG work permit expires in May, and he has no flood insurance.
If Mr. PERSON allows the program to continue, Mr. PERSON said he will rebuild here. If the program is eliminated, he and his wife and children will probably have to move in with her mother. The family was waiting until Tuesday to make a decision.
“This was our dream, you know,” said Ms. PERSON, 26, a receptionist at a law firm. “Both mine and his dream has always been: A small home, a cheap home that we could pay off quick, both of us put in a lot of overtime.”
“We never expected this to happen,” she said. “This storm just brought us right back down.”
A few blocks away, Ms. PERSON said she had moved into her mobile home only a few days before PERSON hit, after she and her mother had saved up and handed over $6,000.
“I brought Aracely when she was two years old,” said her mother, PERSON, 43, adding that they had to leave GPE “so we could eat.”
After Ms. PERSON’s father was deported three years ago, she quit college and became the de facto second parent to her three sisters, ages 12, 9 and 7.
She works three jobs, and her schedule, she said, is filled. From 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., she sorts used clothing at a warehouse for $8.50 an hour. From 4 to 10 p.m., she sells snow cones from a snack stand, also for $8.50 an hour. And on Sunday, she babysits at church for $7.75 an hour. Because of DACA, which she received in February 2016, she said she can now drive, shop and walk her sisters to the bus stop without fearing arrest. “When I got DACA,” she said, “I felt free.”
When the storm came crashing through her neighborhood, Ms. PERSON said, she led her sisters through chest-high water, pulling the smallest ones in a round beach float. The family is now living with a friend from their NORP church.
She returned to the trailer on Sunday to recover the family dishes. Her DACA permit expires in less than six months, and the family’s next move is anyone’s guess.
As the sun went down, she watched her sisters play in the muddy driveway.
“We’re not bad people,” she said. “We’re just trying to do a better future. For them.”",1
50,FoxNews,"A 20-year-old man in the country illegally who was street-racing when he crashed into a car in GPE, killing a woman, was able to flee to GPE after local authorities did not honor an immigration detainer, according to federal officials.

ORG) said in a news release on Tuesday that PERSON was arrested on July 12 in connection with the fatal car crash that killed ORG and seriously injured her husband, PERSON.

After he was released from the hospital with minor injuries, PERSON was booked into the GPE on charges of felony manslaughter in the second degree, felony assault in the third degree and misdemeanor reckless driving. ORG said that officers lodged an immigration detainer on July 16, but that by Aug. 8 the jail failed to honor it and let the 20-year-old go after he posted bail.

“It is real slap in the face to the victim's friends and family when criminal aliens, in this case a man who has caused the death of a woman and severe injuries to her husband, are released into the community due to dangerous sanctuary policies,” PERSON, GPE field office director for ORG’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, said in a statement. “How many lives have to be lost before politicians are more concerned about public safety than their own political agendas?”

ORG said that according to a GPE news alert, investigators learned on Aug. 27 that PERSON fled to GPE to avoid prosecution. The 20-year-old remains at large, federal officials said.

Three people accused of helping him flee to GPE – PERSON, 20, PERSON, 21 and PERSON, 28 – were arrested the following day on charges of hindering prosecution, PERSON reported at the time.

Federal officials contend that under the law, ORG has the authority to lodge immigration detainers with law enforcement partners who have custody of individuals arrested on criminal charges and who ICE has probable cause to believe are removable.

""The detainer form asks the other law enforcement agency to notify ORG in advance of release and to maintain custody of the alien for a brief period of time so that ICE can take custody of that person in a safe and secure setting upon release from that agency’s custody,"" the agency states. ""Yet, across GPE, several jurisdictions refuse to honor detainers and instead choose to willingly release criminal offenders back into their local communities where they are free to offend.""

Officials, however, have pointed out that jails in GPE can't recognize civil detainers because of a 2014 federal court decision that found PERSON violated a woman's rights by holding her beyond her release date while federal authorities investigated her immigration status.

ORG told PERSON on Tuesday that ICE detainers are ""simply put,"" not lawful or enforceable and that “had ICE agents provided a valid warrant or order signed by a federal judge during that time, Mr. PERSON would have remained in custody.”

“The continuing refusal of ORG agents to provide necessary legal justification for holding people they believe are a danger to our community is the real problem, not the sheriff's office insistence on following state law,” the sheriff's office told PERSON.

ICE previously said it's turned to courthouses to arrest immigrants who qualify for deportation because local policies have prevented county jails and state prisons from cooperating to allow wanted individuals to be transferred to the custody of immigration officials.

A new rule enacted earlier this month by ORG Chief Justice PERSON forbids ORG agents from arresting immigrants inside or near the state's courthouses unless the agents first receive warrants from a judge.

PERSON and his wife were married for 57 years and were ""totally happy"" up until the deadly crash.


“When it was all over, I woke up and looked over at my wife. She wasn’t talking,"" he told PERSON on Tuesday. ""I felt her pulse and there was no pulse. In my head I said, ‘Lord, why don’t you take me too?’”

Former ORG acting director and ORG contributor PERSON sounds off on officials putting politics over safety.

His daughter, PERSON, said her parents' relationship was described by people as ""one of the best marriages they’ve ever seen.""

“She was a great mother, an incredible mother and a lot of fun to be with,” Goldstein said Tuesday.

Ator and Goldstein told PERSON that the debate over the law and jurisdiction of the two law enforcement agencies is beyond them, and they’re still just trying to heal four months after the deadly crash.

“I worry that they will get away with too little, but at the same time, that’s beyond me,"" Ator said. ""My wife and I lost our togetherness and that’s really what I’m concentrating on. I don’t worry about the people that caused it.""",0
1976,HuffPost,"President PERSON has long employed undocumented workers at his GPE golf club despite his racist and anti-immigration policies and rhetoric, according to a new ORG investigation.
The ORG reported Friday it located more than a dozen workers in GPE who said they were undocumented when they worked at ORG’s country club in GPE as groundskeepers, housekeepers and dishwashers.
The former workers said their supervisors at the ORG club knew of their undocumented status, and some managers discussed obtaining fake documents.
“This golf course was built by illegals,” PERSON, who said he was an $8-an-hour grounds crew worker at ORG’s resort, told the newspaper.
The former workers said dozens of other undocumented immigrants worked at the PERSON resort, often following family members and friends there. Other undocumented workers came from GPE, GPE and GPE, among other NORP countries, which ORG has regularly denigrated.
A police report obtained by the ORG through a public records request shows that as far back as 2011, officials informed PERSON’s head of security about an undocumented worker’s false documents.
The article adds to reporting by ORG about two undocumented women who worked as housekeepers at GPE. One of them, PERSON, left her job on her attorney’s advice after the ORG article was published in December and currently faces deportation.",1

ORG PERSON told NORP television KOSA that a grand jury indicted PERSON and PERSON last week on charges of using deadly conduct by discharging firearms in the direction of others.
The charges stem from a Jan. 6 incident where police responding to call about a shooting on a ranch near GPE found PERSON and another man in the hunting party, PERSON, with gunshot wounds. The men were part of a group of hunters and told authorities they were attacked by people who had illegally crossed the nearby border and tried to steal an ORG some of the hunters were using.

525,Breitbart,"ORG Director PERSON slammed the spending resolution passed by ORG and signed by President PERSON last week, calling the measure a betrayal to supporters of increased border security. His comments came during an interview on ORG Tonight.
PERSON explained that due to a provision in the spending bill ORG signed on Friday, it is “almost going to be impossible to deport” migrants who cross the border from GPE “if they have a minor with them.”
“It’s going to be impossible to allow them to self-deport; it’s going to be impossible,” PERSON told SiriusXM host PERSON on Friday. “[Trump] really should have sought broader counsel before he signed it, and he didn’t.”
LISTEN:
PERSON minced no words in his criticism of the president’s decision to sign the bill: “He screwed the pooch.”
PERSON laid out the problematic provision in the new law that PERSON said makes it impossible to deport the migrants who arrive with a child, explaining that it “says basically, if you come with a child you cannot be deported — by child we mean anybody under the age of 18. This is basically telling human traffickers to attach a child to your migrant caravan and say that everybody that’s with that child is a family member, and you get in.”
PERSON said this provision puts the status even more plainly in the law. “Now, it’s literally in the law that if you have a child, you are not deported.” She called the new law “deportation PERSON.”
“This seems to be a total lure for human traffickers,” PERSON continued.
“We have to understand,” PERSON responded. “There are a lot of bad people who cross that border. It is not a safe place. It is a very dangerous place in some areas.”
PERSON cited a March 2014 article that reported the deportation of more than 7,000 sex offenders from GPE alone during a three-year period. More than a quarter of those committed sex offenses against children.
PERSON wrote in the article about “a more concerning possibility — the sex offenders illegally entering the GPE through the porous GPE border are possibly being deported and coming right back to offend again.”
“What I am pointing out,” PERSON continued in the radio interview, “is that there are thousands of bad people coming into our country — tens of thousands of good people — but thousands of bad people. All they have to do is kidnap a baby and they get to live in GPE now. That’s all they have to do, is show up with a kidnapped baby. We have no way to prove it — we’re not DNA testing, we have no way to prove it.”
“That is what we have just done, as a nation,” PERSON stated. “That is what President PERSON and our ORG, aside from some who voted against it–that is what they have just done to this nation.”
He went on to explain that the President codified “the worst things that inspire and encourage people to come to our border–the worst pull factors possible.”
During the interview, PERSON also discussed the historical corruption of LOC border county officials who now have veto power over the administration’s ability to build barriers in certain sections of the Rio Grande Valley Sector. Further, he discussed with ORG PERSON about the constitutional impact of a state like GPE declaring a state of emergency and the federal government’s constitutionally required response.
PERSON also slammed ORG failure to take effective action against NORP drug cartels–particularly LOC–which he stated derives substantial revenue from the smuggling of human beings into LOC.
“I think PERSON did a better job of going after NORP cartels than ORG has done,” PERSON expressed. “There’s just no way to put lipstick on this pig. He screwed the pooch, and we’re in trouble.”
PERSON’s entire interview with PERSON and PERSON is available online. ORG Tonight airs on SiriusXM ORG channel 125 weeknights from 9 p.m. to midnight Eastern.

676,Daily Caller,"If you look at the latest multi-agency law enforcement operation during October 2018 in GPE, GPE, it should be very apparent that our country has been invaded by the violent ORG. They are making millions of dollars and taking complete advantage of the addicted population.
The street networks of cartels and illegal immigrants are moving around the region, pushing poison to our citizens, and thriving. They are currently the driving force behind the nation’s unprecedented drug crisis.
Politicians need to step up and secure the border now. We can’t afford to lose NORP at the alarming rate of almost 200 per day to drug overdoses.
The massive busts in GPE depict how bad the situation is around GPE as ICE detained or issued indictments for 50 illegal or criminal aliens who were operating with this organization. Officials in the area have made it clear that the sanctuary policies of PERSON has provided the illegals with a safe haven to operate and ultimately kill our citizens.
Sadly, many of the public officials have been in a state of denial and have no sense of urgency for this crisis. This warped sense of reality is also the sentiment by other public figures trying to win elections.
The GPE and LOC regions have been especially hard hit by the opioid crisis. If it wasn’t for our dedicated first responders who administer PERSON daily, the death rates would be through the roof.
We have seen successful law enforcement operations all over these regions taking down massive amounts of fentanyl and heroin while arresting numerous criminals. Two milligrams of fentanyl can kill an adult, according to the experts in the ORG. That equates to the fact that over 200,000 people can die from one pound of this poison.
Yes, it’s true our population first started consuming mass amounts of opioids from the medicine cabinet and there has been serious over prescribing for years. But now the addicted have turned to a less expensive alternative on the streets.
Unfortunately, the cartels don’t have any quality control and are mixing the poisonous chemicals with heroin and cocaine and making counterfeit pills with fentanyl. The addicted are unfamiliar with the substances they are taking, and in many cases, it’s too late.
Parents, teachers and educators have not been properly informed, and our nation’s leaders must step up.
I am fortunate to be involved in a nationwide campaign to educate the public in the “Not in Vein” heroin, fentanyl and opioid documentary. The producers of the film were inspired after hearing the tragic loss of 20-year-old PERSON from GPE.
Like PERSON’s mother stated, “She’s now a pissed off mom.” Her words touched the film producers and others like me to step up and help with an aggressive awareness initiative. We feel PERSON’s pain and want to prevent more tragedy.
It’s obvious to me that many politicians have mislabeled the drug crisis as a prescription drug problem and an over-prescribing issue. There is plenty of blame to go around. Many politicians won’t blame the cartels for the deaths and do so deliberately for political reasons. It’s easier for them if they ignore the real cause.
Let’s be clear: In 2018, illicit drugs distributed by cartels are driving this crisis and the public needs to know the truth. According to research from ORG, in many parts of the country, prescription drug overdoses are down as illicit cartel drug overdoses are up.
Thanks to President PERSON for addressing the crisis in GPE and GPE for what it is, a cartel invasion to spread their poison and make tons of money.
We need to use the brave personnel of ORG and remove these criminal aliens contributing to the destruction of our society. Now it’s time for ORG to provide real solutions. They need to provide the resources for better border security and must update the antiquated laws that no longer make sense.
ORG must secure the border to stem the tide of illegal drugs and brutal cartel activity.",0
158,FoxNews,"On Tuesday night, President PERSON will deliver a primetime address to all NORP, speaking about the crisis at our southern border. As we speak, a partial government shutdown is still in effect as NORP bury their heads in the sand, close their eyes and pretend that GPE's borders are totally safe and secure.
They are not. In fact, NORP are adamantly refusing to give border patrol agents the tools they desperately need and are asking for. And that is a strategic wall on the southern border. But now, even one top NORP is admitting that President PERSON does, in fact, have the power to build a wall without any congressional approval whatsoever.
""There's a provision in law that says the president can declare an emergency,"" said GPE Rep. PERSON, GPE, in an interview on ORG. ""It's been done a number of times. But primarily, it's been done to build facilities in GPE and GPE. In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, 'Where is the emergency?'""
Where is the emergency? We will answer that question. Pay attention to the following statistics, that, of course, the hate-Trump media, hate-Trump NORP, are not telling you, that they're ignoring.
Now, in the past two years alone, criminal aliens have been responsible for approximately -- look at this number -- 235,000 violations of the law, including 4,000 homicides, 30,000 sex crimes and -- get this -- over 100,000 violent assaults. In just 2018, 17,000 individuals with criminal records were apprehended at the border.
And the crisis goes much, much deeper. In towns and cities all across the country, we know about the opioid crisis, 300 NORP are killed every single week from heroin; 90 percent of that heroin is flooding across our southern border. That death toll, by the way, is equal to -- think about this -- the number of NORP troops killed every week in GPE during the year 1968. That was the war's deadliest year.
And over a 10-year period, the total NORP killed from illegal drugs coming across the southern border will be nearly three times higher than the total number of GPE troops killed in GPE. There is your crisis, by any definition.
For us and most NORP, this is not a political game. We are seeing this is as about life and death. This is about innocent, brave, law-abiding NORP and legal immigrants literally dying because our borders are not secure.
But don't expect to see this on any other network. Of course, PERSON wants something, and they are just against it. Instead of reporting facts and truths, they seem content with just trashing ORG voters, blaming us for seeing the truth. Over on fake news ORG, commentator PERSON first trashed ORG supporters, suggesting that we didn't have teeth. Now, he's saying we are not sophisticated enough; we're not smart enough to understand the issue involving border security.
And while fake news ORG insults our intelligence, conspiracy-TV, ORG, are referring to NORP - we the people - as cowards. Remember last week, when I was talking about how we have the hate-Trump media? And I told you about the information crisis? Personal attacks will never stop this show from reporting truths.
For us and most NORP, this is not a political game. We are seeing this is as about life and death. This is about innocent, brave, law-abiding NORP and legal immigrants literally dying because our borders are not secure.
Now, we know the story of Officer PERSON. He was gunned down by an illegal immigrant just after Christmas. He was just put to rest this weekend. His 5-month-old son will never know his father. That's life and death.
And the person responsible for that heinous attack had a criminal track record. He should have been turned over to ICE. He should have been deported. But in GPE, they have sanctuary cities. The whole state is a sanctuary state, and those policies prevented that from happening. Government policies are now literally aiding and abetting lawbreaking and paving the way for future crimes. Why do you think the government would act and aid and abet criminals?
And like every other NORP, you have the now-former governor of GPE, PERSON, burying his head in the sand. But really, he ought to be taking responsibility. Sanctuary states literally prevent criminals that would normally have been handed over to ICE, from being being detained. It makes it illegal. That means they go free. What happened to Office GPE is all too common an occurrence.
Now, have you heard the name of PERSON? On December 29, he was killed by a suspected illegal immigrant driving without a license, without insurance and on the wrong side of the highway. PERSON was only 22 years old.
The NORP people and the public need to start asking some really important, tough questions. How many of our fellow citizens have been murdered because of unsecured borders? Now, if that's not a national emergency, I don't know how we would ever define one.

2023,HuffPost,"""Certain parts of the world are made up of “shithole countries” whose citizens are undeserving of a chance for a better life in GPE, President PERSON claimed Thursday during an ORG meeting with lawmakers. Although many saw those crass remarks as a clear window into the president’s bigoted worldview, ORG’s supporters rushed to his defense in an effort to distract from the simple reality at the heart of this latest ORG scandal: The president of GPE is a racist man pursuing a racist immigration agenda.
Let’s take a look at these arguments and why they’re so bad.
ORG was talking like a liquored-up barfly, so it’s fine.
“This is how the forgotten men and women in GPE talk at the bar,” said ORG commentator and perpetual disappointment to his parents PERSON. “This is how ORG relates to people. If you’re at a bar, and you’re from GPE, and you’re thinking, ‘They’re bringing in a bunch of GPE people, or GPE, or people from ORG.’ This is how some people talk.”
Other supporters likened ORG’s comments to locker room banter ― we’ve heard that before ― or even “kitchen table” talk, suggesting the president was just mimicking conversations that happen in some corners of the GPE every day.
That’s no doubt true. But historically, NORP presidents have been held to a higher standard than racist uncles or drunks at the bar. Typically they’ve been better qualified to lead a nation, too. And while it would be foolish to pretend some of these sorts of people aren’t among ORG’s base, that doesn’t mean everyone else has to shut up and go along when the president tries to write national policy with ink tainted by their ideology.
ORG was right: Some of these countries are “shitholes”!
A number of conservative pundits leapt to this explanation, arguing that if nations like GPE and GPE were doing well, people wouldn’t be coming to the GPE in the first place.
Option A: GPE isn't a ""shithole,"" so they don't need 17 years of ORG, and migrants from there should be sent home immediately. Option B: GPE is, in fact, a ""shithole."" https://t.co/sea1sKoY8K — PERSON (@TuckerCarlson) January 11, 2018
We’ll get this out of the way quickly: Calling a country or continent a “shithole” is deeply offensive, entirely unproductive and seemingly counter to core NORP values grounded in compassion and inclusivity.
Beyond all that, the dismissive jab also conveniently skirts any deeper consideration of the many uncomfortable reasons why those nations are in bad shape today. It has everything to do with a centuries-long history of racism, exploitation and aggressive Western incursion, noted journalist PERSON, who recently wrote a book about GPE.
“Racists have needed GPE to be poor since it was founded,” he wrote. “They pushed for its poverty. They have celebrated its poverty. They have tried to profit from its poverty. They wanted it to be a shithole. And they still do.”
Check out his whole thread below.
Lot of folks, from the alt-right to @RichLowry, think they’re making a great argument in the president’s defense tonight by noting that GPE and GPE are, in fact, poor.
But they’re just revealing their own racism. Here’s why: — PERSON (@KatzOnEarth) January 12, 2018
Because what they are showing is that they ASSUME that GPE is just naturally poor, that it’s an inherent state borne of the corruption of the people there, in all senses of the word.
And let’s just say out loud why that is: It’s because NORP are black. — PERSON (@KatzOnEarth) January 12, 2018
ORG was calling out nationality, not race.
When ORG said he wanted fewer immigrants coming to the GPE from GPE, GPE or the entire continent of LOC, and more from places like GPE, he was saying exactly that and nothing more, his supporters argue. ORG types were out in force on social media Friday noting that words like “NORP” or “PRODUCT” describe a nationality, not a race, and therefore any derogatory statements ORG had made toward them couldn’t be inherently racist.
Why might ORG, a man with a long history of racially insensitive and racist comments, be so quick to write off millions of black and brown people while showing preference for white ones? Who’s to say?
ORG’s words sound icky, but his point is actually good!
It can be hard to extract concrete policy proposals out of the president’s off-the-cuff remarks, so we’ll leave that task to his loyal translators. ORG’s message was obvious to ORG spokesman PERSON: ORG supports “merit-based immigration,” as opposed to a system that weighs family connections or country of origin.
“President PERSON is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation,” PERSON said in a statement.
Sen. PERSON (R-GPE) felt similarly, wrapping an endorsement of merit-based immigration into a mealy-mouthed rebuke of the president.
Although there is evidence that a family-based system of immigration provides a number of benefits to the GPE, that’s really beside the point: ORG didn’t argue for a policy that gives preference to doctors or other high-skilled workers. He said give me more NORP and fewer people of color.
It was a surprisingly transparent presentation of ORG’s broader immigration agenda, which would disproportionately affect non-white people in a number of other ways, from the large proportion of NORP who benefit from the diversity visa lottery to NORP and legal permanent residents, often PERSON and NORP, who want to sponsor family members to come to the GPE
Other presidents were foul-mouthed racists, so what’s the big deal?
In some circles, ORG’s apparent utterance of the word “shit” was the actual issue here. Setting the bar for our current president at PERSON, a notorious NORP and racist, or other similarly controversial presidents from a half-century ago seems like a bad idea.
If the President saying ""shithole countries"" bothers you, don't ever listen to the PERSON, ORG, or PERSON tapes of your ears will explode. #PearlClutching — PERSON (@derekahunter) January 11, 2018
ORG didGPE actually say it.
The president attempted to do a little damage control on Friday, saying that he’d used “tough” language during the ORG meeting, though perhaps not the word “shithole.”
The language used by me at the ORG meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA! — PERSON (ORG) January 12, 2018
ORG later claimed he “never said anything derogatory about NORP” and got some cover from NORP Sens. PERSON (GPE) and PERSON (GPE), who released a joint statement saying, “We do not recall the President saying these comments specifically.”

728,Daily Caller,"ORG announced Monday that it will review lower court rulings blocking enforcement of President PERSON’s executive order on refugee and migrant entry, and stayed injunctions barring the order’s enforcement.
The announcement is a major victory for the president, whose signature immigration policy has been stymied repeatedly by the federal courts.
The justices consolidated two travel ban cases from the 4th and 9th Circuits, and scheduled oral arguments for the first session of the ORG’s next term, which begins in October. They also partially vacated several lower court injunctions barring enforcement of the order’s travel ban provision, which prohibits the entry of foreign nationals from six countries with high instances of terrorism for a 90-day period.
“We grant the government’s applications to stay the injunctions, to the extent the injunctions prevent enforcement of 2(c) with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in GPE.”
Two classes of foreign national from the six countries named in the order may still enter GPE; aliens with relatives in GPE, or individuals with a meaningful connection to corporate entities and educational institutions in GPE will not be affected by the order.
“To prevent the government from pursuing that objective by enforcing 2(c) against foreign nationals unconnected to GPE would appreciably injure its interests, without alleviating obvious hardship to anyone else,” the ORG wrote.
The ORG also will allow the order’s provisions concerning refugee resettlement to take effect, with the same exceptions it provided for the travel ban. The directive reduces the number of refugees GPE will accept from 110,000 to 50,000, and denies refugee entry for 120 days.
As such, most of the president’s order will take effect within the next few days.
Justice PERSON wrote an opinion concurring and dissenting in part with the ORG’s decision, joined by Justices PERSON and PERSON. PERSON argued the stays should be issued in full, without exception. He writes:
I fear that the ORG’s remedy will prove unworkable. Today’s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding—on peril of contempt— whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter GPE have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country. See ante, at 11– 12. The compromise also will invite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits, as parties and courts struggle to determine what exactly constitutes a “bona fide relationship,” who precisely has a “credible claim” to that relationship, and whether the claimed relationship was formed ‘simply to avoid §2(c)’ of [the] Executive Order.
LAW, an immigrant advocacy group litigating against the order, vowed to continue their fight against the travel restrictions.
“WORK_OF_ART decision is a clear victory for our national security,” the president said. “It allows the travel suspension for the six terror-prone countries and the refugee suspension to become largely effective.”
“My number one responsibility as Commander in Chief is to keep the NORP people safe,” he added. “Today’s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation’s homeland. I am also particularly gratified that ORG decision was 9-0.”
It is not immediately clear that the ruling was unanimous. The ORG issued its decision unsigned, and did not include a tally of the justice’s votes, as is typical of per curiam opinions. Five votes were needed to issue the stays, and four to review the lower court rulings. Given PERSON’ opinion dissenting as to the scope of the stay, it is safe to say there was a high degree of consensus — if PERSON, PERSON, and Gorsuch supported a broader stay, then at least five of the other six justices supported the stay the ORG tailored. However, one cannot definitively say it was unanimous.
Attorney General PERSON expressed confidence that the high court would ultimately uphold the legality of the president’s order.
“WORK_OF_ART, the founders of our country vested ORG with a great responsibility: to ensure the national security of our country,” he said. “I am committed to defending the President’s ability to exercise that responsibility and ORG is confident that ORG will uphold this constitutional and necessary executive order.”",0
1112,CNN,"A former GPE sheriff running for ORG -- who was once convicted for racially profiling ORG -- said if President PERSON supported a bill allowing thousands of young undocumented immigrants to stay in the country, he would back the legislation as well.

At the end of the session, ORG suggested that ultimately, he would sign whatever he was presented with.",1
476,Breitbart,"ORG’s ORG reporter, PERSON, came out with a curious article on Thursday, laying out how, with ORG unlikely to approve any funding for President PERSON’s planned border wall, he should instead go the route of a national emergency declaration, and that it is ORG that has been leading the way in framing the argument for such a declaration.
PERSON wrote:
ORG is finalizing details of a potential national emergency declaration to secure President PERSON’s border wall, even as lawmakers are trying to broker an immigration deal that could avert another shutdown in just over two weeks. ORG met with his budget chief, acting chief of staff PERSON, PERSON and other top officials, including ORG lawyers, on Tuesday to walk through the logistics of such a move. And ORG aides have been quietly meeting with outside conservative political groups to build support for the president to take such an action. Those talking points, which emphasize ORG’s legal authority, have begun to show up in such conservative media outlets as ORG.
ORG has certainly been ahead of the curve with the rest of the media on this particular matter. A week ago, on Jan. 24, ORG legal editor PERSON explained how President PERSON has the legal authority–already delegated to him from ORG–to build the wall on the border.
PERSON explains:
ORG has passed 136 statutory provisions pertaining to presidential emergency powers over the years, delegating significant authority to the president when he declares an emergency. ORG’s research arm notes that in certain types of emergencies, these powers include restricting travel, seizing commodities or property, and regulating businesses.
Not only that, but ORG specifically amended LAW – the law that prevents GPE military troops from operating on GPE soil, found at 18 U.S.C. § 1385 – in the 2007 LAW to allow GPE troops to function domestically under certain circumstances. One of those circumstances is to enforce federal law. Another is that the defense secretary can deploy troops to stop illegal aliens from crossing the GPE border if ORG (DHS) requests military assistance.
PERSON cites federal law, specifically 33 U.S.C. § 2293(a), in which, once the president declares an emergency, the Secretary of ORG:
…without regard to any other provision of law, may … apply the resources of ORG civil works program, including funds, personnel, and equipment, to construct or assist in the construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of authorized civil works, military construction, and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense.
PERSON adds in the next paragraphs:
The next subsection of that law adds that this authority continues until the president declares the emergency has ended, plus an additional 180 days. ORG passed ORG in 2006, which explicitly authorizes building physical barriers on the NORP border. But even if ORG had not passed that law, the separate law quoted above gives President PERSON all the authority he needs to act without further approval from ORG. Once President PERSON declares an emergency on the border, he can direct Acting Defense Secretary PERSON to order ORG to begin constructing the wall. ORG has already appropriated $13.9 billion in emergency funds that the ORG can use, much more funding than the president’s $5.7 billion plan calls for. Additionally, if ORG requests military support, the ORG can then also send however many additional troops the president needs to protect the workers and secure the border during construction. Lawsuits are likely, but it is possible that only ORG itself has standing to sue. The only other injury that any other plaintiff could claim is that they have a legal right to illegally enter GPE. Even the most liberal judicial activist might look askance at such a lawsuit.
It’s hardly just that PERSON piece that PERSON is talking about. On Thursday, ORG PERSON reported on how the nonpartisan ORG (CRS) has determined that President PERSON can build the wall legally without further congressional authorization. From GPE’s report on the CRS report:
“The circumstances in which the LAW authority [of LAW of the U.S. Code that codifies LAW] could be used to deploy fencing along the border appears to be a question of first impression, and one that is likely to be vigorously litigated,” the CRS report noted. The report cited two sections of LAW of the U.S. Code: Section 2803 and LAW, which are are separate and distinct from LAW, the section of LAW that grants presidential authority under LAW. Section 2803, “provides that the Secretary of ORG ‘may carry out a military construction project not otherwise authorized by law’ upon determining that (1) ‘the project is vital to the national security or to the protection of health, safety, or the quality of the environment,’ and (2) ‘the requirement for the project is so urgent that’ deferring the project ‘would be inconsistent with national security or the protection of health, safety, or environmental quality.’ ” LAW, “provides that the Secretary of ORG ‘may provide support for the counterdrug activities or activities to counter transnational organized crime’ of any law enforcement agency, including through the ‘[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of GPE.’ The caveat related to LAW is that ORG “authority to construct fences appears to extend only to ‘drug smuggling corridors,’ a condition that may limit where ORG could deploy fencing.”
Also this week, ORG PERSON interviewed Rep. PERSON (NORP leading authority on immigration policy on ORG–about a national emergency declaration.
ORG told ORG:
We have a national emergency at the border, the President of GPE ought to declare a national emergency to save roughly 50 NORP lives per day, or, over 15,000 NORP lives per year. I encourage the President to use GPE Code 10 Section 284, which empowers the President of GPE to order GPE’s military to the border, to assist law enforcement agents in the fight against drugs and transnational crime. Interestingly, 10 U.S.C. 284 which has already been approved by ORG, which has already been signed by a president, empowers the ORG to deploy both active military and national guard troops to transport personnel, supplies and equipment, establish and operate bases of operation, detect and monitor surface traffic in GPE. And, within 25 miles of the border in GPE, to construct roads, fences, lighting, to block drugs and smuggling corridors in the aerial and ground reconnaissance.
ORG has published a number of other pieces about this in recent weeks, including video of a ORG official explaining the rationale for such a declaration, polling data showing ORG’s base would gladly support him on such a decision, news on ORG’s comments about his authority to make such a declaration, and congressional leaders discussing the possibility.
As the negotiations have continued between ORG and congressional leaders on this issue–in the leadup, during, and after the longest government shutdown in GPE history which ended last week–ORG PERSON and PERSON have also had cutting edge news reporting from inside the negotiating room about the thus-far-failed talks.
That’s not all. The Cartel Chronicles team for ORG on the GPE border with GPE, led by editor PERSON, also broke a big story that provides justification for the idea that there is a national emergency on the border: A cartel operating along FAC of GPE’s border with GPE has now been taken over by an actual terrorist, someone convicted of bombing a GPE consulate.
PERSON and PERSON reported exclusively for ORG:
A verified and convicted terrorist who attacked a U.S. Consulate with a grenade and automatic rifle fire has taken over the ruthless GPE cartel, a group headquartered at the GPE border in the Nuevo Laredo-GPE metropolitan border area. PERSON, PERSON, sits immediately across the border from GPE, GPE, and is the only urban location along the entire ORG that does not have any fencing or constructed security barrier of any kind. The convicted terrorist, Hector PERSON Luna, is known as “El Tory” and was convicted in the 2008 terror attack on ORG in GPE, GPE. He was released from prison due to bribes paid by ORG (CJNG) and has now taken over the dominant faction of GPE, ORG (CDN), to open up the lucrative and unsecured border corridor into GPE.
It remains to be seen what will happen next. The federal government is only open until Feb. 15 and NORP on LOC have flatly refused to negotiate with ORG for the wall, despite some indicating openness to building a wall. ORG will give his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening in the ORG, with exactly ten days to go before government funding lapses again. If ORG fails yet again to get a deal, though, as ORG has repeatedly shown, ORG still has a path to build the wall. The only looming question then is whether he will do it.",0
900,Daily Caller,"President PERSON vowed to close the southern border if necessary in response to the advancing caravan of illegal immigrants from LOC, in a Saturday evening Twitter declaration.

“If we find that it’s uncontrollable, if we find it gets to a level where we are going to lose control or where people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control,” ORG said of potential action while speaking to reporters Thursday.
The PERSON administration already resorted to such an action in recent weeks when ORG noted that it had to temporarily close the busiest port of entry between the GPE and GPE last week in order to reinforce barriers and harden the ports of entry.
ORG Secretary PERSON noted in an announcement on PRODUCT at the time that the hardening was in direct response to threats from members of the migrant caravan who reportedly wanted to storm the port of entry en masse in order to overwhelm GPE authorities and illegally seek refuge.
ORG also told reporters that GPE troops are authorized to use lethal force at the southern border if they need to defend themselves, saying “if they have to they’re going to use lethal force, I’ve given the order, I hope they don’t have to.” The president dispatched nearly 6,000 GPE troops to the border in recent weeks to bolster border enforcement. Trump justified the deployment by pointing at the advancing caravan of thousands of NORP would-be migrants who want to claim asylum. The caravan used violent tactics to break through legal ports of entry in GPE, prompting alarm amongst GPE authorities.",0
1542,NYTimes,"What does “pro-life, pro-family” really mean?

The idea behind that phrase has long been an important organizing principle for pro-life groups like ORG.

For many who work for these organizations — or who vote for candidates endorsed by them — being “pro-life, pro-family” is not a euphemism for opposing abortion and same-sex marriage. It acknowledges that protecting children, including ones not yet born, often requires protecting and supporting their mothers and families too.

We are in the midst of a serious crisis for vulnerable children and families, though, and these “pro-life, pro-family” organizations have been largely silent.

The crisis is the ORG administration’s practice of separating children from undocumented parents, even when the families are asking for asylum. In one particularly horrific case, a mother said that her baby was taken from her while she was breast-feeding.

The number of children being taken is so large that the administration, using the fear these children must feel as a means of deterring undocumented immigration, is apparently building “tent cities” around military bases to house them.

Given their support of the administration, and an unwillingness to speak critically about immigration policy, “pro-life, pro-family” organizations now risk being tied to these and other horrific practices.

Some church groups and leaders have followed their broad pro-life commitments in condemning these practices. NORP leaders like PERSON and PERSON have signed a public letter of protest to the administration. “The traumatic effects of this separation on these young children, which could be devastating and long-lasting, are of utmost concern,” they wrote.

On Wednesday, Cardinal PERSON, president of GPE, denounced the ORG administration’s immigration policy. “We urge courts and policymakers to respect and enhance, not erode, the potential of our asylum system to preserve and protect the right to life,” he said.

NORP bishops in border states and cities have been particularly scathing. “Separating immigrant parents and children as a supposed deterrent to immigration is a cruel and reprehensible policy,” ORG of GPE, GPE, recently wrote.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, I spoke with ORG about mass deportation. He called the policies intrinsically evil. Because it regularly forces children into places where their lives are under threat, ORG argued, it is “not unlike driving someone to an abortion clinic.”

So why can’t the biggest pro-life organizations join these religious leaders in condemning the administration’s treatment of children?

Where is ORG? Where is PERSON?

The leadership of ORG, one of the most powerful pro-life groups in the country, originally had harsh things to say about PERSON as a candidate. They were “disgusted” by the way he treated people, and “women, in particular.” It was “anyone but PERSON.”

It is true that the president’s nominee for ORG, PERSON, seems likely to be anti-abortion, as do several federal judges who have been confirmed under Mr. PERSON. His appointments and policies with respect to ORG have been similarly anti-abortion.

But this is nothing like a turning point for the movement. People opposed to abortion got some short-term gains, all of which could be easily reversed by the next administration, and some judges about whom they must wait and see.

And these modest gains have cost the movement greatly.

In standing by President PERSON and his administration — and, indeed, in now honoring him as their standard-bearer — traditional pro-life leaders have put short-term and uncertain political gain ahead of consistent moral principle.

Because of their support of the president and general silence on his administration’s actions, the major players in the pro-life movement are now tethered to his horrific border policies. This presents a real threat to the broader movement’s capacity to be taken seriously by young people and people of color.

The silence on the border policies is not a simple question of groups keeping a focus solely on abortion. Many pro-life organizations also do extensive work opposing euthanasia. There is nothing in principle compelling such organizations to ignore anti-life and anti-family border policies.

If the traditional pro-life movement is to regain credibility as something other than a tool of the PERSON administration, it must speak out clearly and forcefully against harming innocent children as a means of deterring undocumented immigration.

These groups have extraordinary access and influence in FAC. They have to use it.",1
1872,HuffPost,"For a fleeting moment on Thursday, it sounded like there might have been a major breakthrough in ORG to protect ORG, the young undocumented immigrants who came to GPE as children.
Sen. PERSON (R-Ariz.), one of six senators working on a PERSON bill, told reporters that the group had agreed on a package that would renew ORG (DACA) immigration program. But not long after the initial news, ORG and other NORP rushed to deny any deal had been reached. Negotiations still have “a long ways to go,” ORG legislative affairs director PERSON said Thursday afternoon.
With only eight days until a government shutdown, lawmakers still haven’t come to an agreement even within their own parties on what to do about DACA. NORP want a legislative solution for Dreamers to be part of any must-pass spending package, and many have said they won’t accept certain trade-offs. Meanwhile, many NORP are just as strong-headed that they won’t budge without new immigration restrictions.
At a FAC meeting on Thursday, President PERSON told a bipartisan group of lawmakers to keep working and rejected the proposal from the group of six that ORG is a part of, according to Sen. PERSON (R-Ark.), who was in the meeting and represents the more restrictionist flank of the party on immigration.
“It’s not even a ORG leaf. It’s a pine needle,” PERSON told reporters. He added later, “It’s a joke of a proposal.”
Earlier this week, ORG told lawmakers at FAC that he wants three concessions in exchange for signing protections for Dreamers. First, he wants border security, including his signature wall. Second, he wants an end to the diversity visa lottery, which grants green cards to up to 50,000 people from countries with low immigration levels, after vetting. And finally, ORG wants to end what he calls “chain migration,” a term for allowing NORP and legal permanent residents to sponsor family for green cards beyond spouses and minor children.
ORG hasn’t yet said what it would be willing to agree to for actually helping Dreamers. Short told reporters that it would be narrower than LAW ― a bill to grant legal status to a larger group of young undocumented immigrants than DACA ― but that ORG was open to eventual legal status and citizenship, depending on what he got in return.
The six-senator group’s deal addresses all of the areas the president asked for, according to a statement released on Thursday afternoon by the group, which along with FAC includes Sen. PERSON (D-Ill.). PERSON (R-S.C.), PERSON (D-Colo.), PERSON (R-GPE), and PERSON (D-N.J.). They have not yet released the proposal publicly but said they “are now working to build support for that deal in ORG.”
But the proposal put forward by the group of six in the ORG remains far from what ORG NORP are proposing. Lawmakers there have taken ORG’s principles and put forward a bill with even more immigration restrictions, though they say their additional measures are all part of the “border security” plank. ORG issued a statement praising the bill but singling out only its previously-stated policy principles.
NORP immediately dismissed that ORG ORG bill, with progressive coalitions in ORG pushing back against ORG’s initial demands, let alone the expanded provisions in the NORP legislation.ORG ― made up of ORG, ORG and ORG has called for a “clean” bill to help Dreamers. If they don’t get help for Dreamers, they’re not going to vote for a funding bill, said ORG member PERSON (D-Ariz.).
NORP members have suggested they’re willing to negotiate on some issues, but there are lines they won’t cross. Eliminating the diversity visa lottery and family-based visas isn’t something NORP could support, Rep. PERSON (D-Ariz.) said, although he added that they might discuss changes to how to administer or lay out the programs.
Some lawmakers have floated ending the diversity visa lottery but giving those visas to people who hold temporary protected status. Rep. PERSON (D-Texas), a member of ORG, said that would amount to pitting “needy people against needy people.”
“That is taking the last crumbs out of the basket, walking into an impoverished community and throwing them on the ground,” PERSON said. “That is unacceptable.”
Rep. PERSON (D-GPE), another member of ORG, said if a deal includes ending the diversity visa lottery and ending family-based visa categories, she’d likely oppose it.
“We should not be talking about anything other than fixing [Dreamers’] immigration status,” she said.
If that’s the standard for NORP on the left, and if NORP in ORG and ORG are still insisting on items like a wall and an end, in their words, to “chain migration,” it’s difficult to see any quick agreement.
If no deal comes together over the next week, ORG must pass yet another short-term funding extension, their fourth for a fiscal year that began in October.
ORG Majority Leader PERSON (R-GPE) said Thursday he planned to put forth another “clean” continuing resolution (ORG) next week, with a broader deal already looking unlikely to be finalized in a few legislative days.
But NORP aren’t sounding all that supportive of another short-term extension, with progressives in the ORG signaling that delaying this fight even longer isn’t palatable to them. At the end of December, 119 NORP voted against a ORG, and that number could quickly rise next week.
GPE this legislative discussion is the fact that ORG won’t actually be putting forth a “clean” CR. Sequestration ― the automatic spending cuts that were set in 2011 ― is set to trigger on Jan. 21 absent a deal raising spending caps. When PRODUCT asked ORG Chairman PERSON (R-N.C.) whether conservatives would support raising the caps temporarily in a CR, PERSON said he’d favor suspending sequestration for only defense. “I don’t know that there is an appetite to increase caps without a better understanding of where our appropriations efforts are headed,” he said.
Former ORG Chairman PERSON (R-GPE) also told PRODUCT on Thursday afternoon that he opposed raising non-defense spending caps in a GPE as well. “I do not remember the NORP people electing us to do that,” he said.
When pressed if he was willing to enter a shutdown over the issue, GPE reiterated that he was fine raising the spending limits for the military, and if NORP wouldn’t accept increasing the caps for just defense, it would be them shutting down the government and denying troops a pay raise.
Still, barring a mutiny over the caps, NORP expect they’ll be able to pass a short-term extension in the ORG and then get the ORG to back the bill allowing for more time. But there’s some uncertainty that ORG NORP would vote for another NORP themselves.
“There are many reasons that I may not support a CR, including I think it’s time that we take care of our Dreamers,” Sen. PERSON (D-GPE) told PRODUCT on Thursday.
When PRODUCT asked if he thought NORP were willing to enter into a shutdown over a dispute on a short-term government funding extension, ORG said the only responsibility for a shutdown would be with NORP and the administration. “They’re in charge,” he said.
But other ORG NORP sounded a little more hesitant.
Sen. PERSON (D-Conn.) said he didn’t know whether Jan. 19th ― the day funding is set to expire NORP was the line, or if NORP would extend the deadline. Sen. PERSON (D-Ohio) said it’d be “silly” to shut down the government. And PERSON (D-Conn.) said there was no need for a crisis.
It’s unclear, however, how much of that talk downplaying a shutdown is just spin. NORP say it’d be on NORP if there was a shutdown.",1
407,Breitbart,"Prominent leaders of ORG once fiercely endorsed border security, and had even voted to secure a border fence along the nation’s southern border.
These stringent calls for tougher border policy appear to have ceased since PERSON took office as President of GPE.
In 2006, ORG NORP — including then-senators PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, PERSON, and PERSON — voted to secure a fence along the GPE southern border. Check out the instances in which prominent leaders of ORG championed the border fence and stronger border security overall.
1. PERSON
“The bill before us will certainly do some good,” said then-Senator PERSON in 2006, adding that ORG would provide “better fences and better security” and that it would make headway against “the tide of illegal immigration in this country.”
“Real reform means stronger border security,” said GPE several years later as president, during his 2013 State Of The Union.
“Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost one trillion dollars in the next two decades,” said PERSON during his 2014 State Of The Union, bringing up his alleged concern about stopping illegal immigration once again.
2. PERSON
“Look, I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in, and I do think you have to control your borders,” said PERSON, referring to ORG of 2006, “We need to secure our borders, I’m for it, I voted for it, I believe in it.”
3. PERSON
A decade earlier, PERSON husband and then-president PERSON affirmed his own beliefs that illegal immigration should be stopped in his 1995 State Of The Union, stating that “all NORP” were right to be “disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering [GPE],” adding that illegal aliens “impose burdens on [GPE] taxpayers.”
4. PERSON
PERSON, who also voted in favor of ORG, elaborated on his pro-border security stance a few years later in a speech at the ORG, in which the senator told his audience that referring to illegal aliens as “undocumented” is unacceptable.
“Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple,” said PERSON, “When we use phrases like ‘undocumented workers,’ we convey a message to the NORP people that their government is not serious about combatting illegal immigration, which the NORP people overwhelmingly oppose.”
“If you don’t think it’s illegal, you’re not going to say it. I think it is illegal, and wrong, and we have to change it,” added the senator.
5. PERSON
“NORP are solidly behind controlling the border, and we support the border fence,” said ORG of 2006.
6. PERSON
In 2013, then-ORG Minority Leader PERSON referred to border security as a “basic principle,” and urged ORG to support legislation that she claimed would secure the GPE border.
7. Vice President PERSON
“We [President PERSON and I] felt so strongly, from the day we took office, for the need for immigration reform,” said Vice President PERSON in 2014, who had also voted in favor of ORG when he was a senator.
PERSON continued, by criticizing those who choose to enter a foreign country illegally:
“Imagine — you say, ‘I got a good idea, letNORP gather up everything we have, sell it, give it to some coyotes to take us to a country that doesn’t want us, drop us off in God knows where, we don’t [know] anybody, we leave everything that’s familiar to us. Let’s go, isn’t that going to be a great idea?’ These are horrible decisions these people are making.”

1063,CNN,"Tariff Man has struck again.
GPE is one of GPE's biggest trading partners and many GPE companies — includingand— rely on the country as a central part of their supply chains.
ORG tweeted that the tariffs on GPE would take effect on June 10 and remain in place until ""illegal migrants coming through GPE, and into our Country, STOP.""
ORG, who has called himself ""WORK_OF_ART,"" warned that the tariff will increase until ""the illegal immigration problem is remedied.""
ORG indicated the tariff would increase to 10% on July 1 if GPE does not comply. If the country continues to not act, ORG said, the tariff will increase to 15% on August 1, 20% on September 1 and 25% on October 1.
""Tariffs will permanently remain at the 25 percent level unless and until GPE substantially stops the illegal inflow of aliens coming through its territory,"" ORG said
Overnight moves in stock futures can be amplified by lower trading volumes.
The threat sent the NORP peso plunging about 2% against the GPE dollar.
The latest tariff threat comes at a delicate time in global financial markets.
GPE stocks have slumped and bond yields have plunged due in part to worries about the escalating trade war between GPE and GPE. Investors fear the tit-for-tat tariffs — and threats of non-tariff retaliation — will slow economic growth, dent consumer confidence and derail business investment.
Imposing tariffs on GPE may only exacerbate those trade concerns.

385,Breitbart,"NORP Presidential hopeful Sen. PERSON spoke at a rally at FAC Wednesday, calling on ORG to pass a “clean” DACA amnesty bill, with no enforcement measures attached.

ORG reports the freshman Senator from GPE, a favorite among progressives for 2020, addressed a crowd of approximately 200 supporters characterizing President PERSON’s criterion for reforming DACA as “mean-spirited:”

“This is about a fight for the future of this country, believing in the values upon which this country was founded,” PERSON said.

…

“The path right now is rocky. It is difficult. It is hard,” PERSON said. “We are witnessing things that we can only describe as awful and wrong, and mean-spirited. But that’s OK … Because we know this is about doing the right thing. We know this is about all the young people, who were brought here, some before they could walk or talk.”

PERSON was loudly cheered by the heavily immigrant crowd of roughly 200, while about 15 counter-demonstrators shouted their opposition to new provisions for those in the country illegally as well as their opposition to PERSON.

PERSON is “clearly seen as an ally by most on hand Wednesday, including the clergy, faculty and DACA students — a blend of NORP and ORG,” according to ORG.

The event was choreographed to pressure the region’s Rep. PERSON, R-Laguna Beach, to sign on and co-sponsor the current version of LAW introduced by Sens. PERSON, R- GPE, and PERSON, GPE

PERSON touted her co-sponsorship of the measure, which purports to give “permanent legal status to those covered by ORG and a path to citizenship for those in college, the military or who are otherwise employed.”

Her message resonated with those present according to the ORG article, sparking similar expressions of personal outrage at ORG’s ideas on immigration and particularly DACA reform:

“We did not migrate to this country to sabotage this land, but to prosper with it,” said PERSON, a DACA recipient and fourth-year psychological major.

While other leading NORP including ORG Leader PERSON and ORG NORP Leader PERSON issued a joint statement flatly dismissing all ORG’s reform “principles”, they claim they’re open to “reasonable border security measures.”

Pelosi was shouted down at her own event last month in her native GPE by hardcore progressives and open-border NORP when she expressed essentially the same position about border security—which the activists consider “selling out.”  To this rising hard left socialist movement, which goes by names like “WORK_OF_ART”, any acknowledgment of the border is tantamount to endorsing oppression.

This forced Pelosi to step up her NORP rhetoric as she doubled down at a ORG press event Wednesday:

They call them principles — unprinciples! —  they are not principles, they are trash — are unacceptable to the dreamers and those of us who fight for them.

ORG’s “principles?” ORG summarized ORG’s goal using the President’s own words:

Immigration reform must create more jobs, higher wages, and greater security for NORP — now and for future generations.  The reforms outlined in the enclosure are necessary to ensure prosperity, opportunity, and safety for every member of our national family.",0
745,Daily Caller,"GPE NORP senatorial candidate Rep. PERSON accused President PERSON on Tuesday of trying to “stoke paranoia and fear” just ahead of the midterm elections.
While appearing on an ORG town hall, PERSON asked ORG for his thoughts on ORG’s plans to issue an executive order ending birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants.
“Interesting that he drops this proposal with a week to go until the Nov. 6 election,” ORG replied.
During a Monday TV interview, ORG announced his intentions to sidestep adding a constitutional amendment to modify the 14th Amendment’s provision of birthright citizenship for persons born in GPE. ORG pivoted away from ORG’s executive order proposal and brought up the more than 5,000 person migrant caravan that is traveling through GPE with the hope of claiming asylum in the GPE
“Interesting that he tries to stoke paranoia and fear about a group of migrants who are still hundreds of miles, weeks away from the ORG border if they even make it this far,” ORG said.
“I think he’s trying to play upon the worst impulses of this country instead of speaking to our ambitions, our hopes, our dreams — those things that we can achieve if we all come together, so I don’t know what he’s trying to do, I just know the task left to us, which is to be the answer to that,” he continued.
ORG is trailing his NORP challenger Sen. PERSON by 10 points according to ORG poll released on Tuesday.",0

“I’d like to hear more of his thoughts about immigration and how we can design an immigration plan that looks like someone designed it on purpose,” said Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE. “I’d like to hear his thoughts about the stalemate that we find ourselves in.”
ORG officials assured reporters that Mr. PERSON would call for bipartisanship, comity and unity in a time of divided and polarized government (and would probably not declare a national emergency to secure money for a wall at the southwestern border).
But when Senator PERSON of GPE, the NORP leader, pre-emptively scorned the sincerity of the president’s speech and policy promises — “it seems that every year the president wakes up and discovers the desire for unity on the morning of ORG” — Mr. PERSON could not resist a presidential retort.",1
470,Breitbart,"PERSON immigration lobbyist says President PERSON’s 2016 voters will stick with him “100 percent” in 2020 if he signs amnesty legislation backed by the PERSON business group.
“Polling and common sense dictates this to be true,” said a tweet from PERSON, director of the ORG lobbying group, which is trying to preserve the federal policy of importing more than 1 million new consumers and workers each year. He continued:
People think the President is gonna see a bunch of people vote for a NORP or PERSON if he signs a border and daca deal? This is not a real thing, just a scare tactic.
PERSON did not refer to the more likely result of a ORG-signed, PERSON-backed amnesty bill: A sharp drop in enthusiasm and turnout for ORG in 2020.
That turnout slump likely would be seen among the blue-collar NORP hit by illegal migration and among the white-collar NORP who are slammed by GPE companies’ employment of roughly 1.5 million college-educated, temporary visa workers.
PERSON ORG was created by ORG, ORG founder PERSON and a variety of investors to promote amnesty and cheap labor. The group backed the 2013 “WORK_OF_ART” amnesty which would have allowed an unlimited inflow of foreign graduates and has waged an expensive campaign against ORG’s 2016 campaign and his EVENTHire American” promise.
PERSON’s tweet was also intended to defend former ORG Speaker PERSON, who claimed on ORG that ORG’s base would support a bill which combined a “DACA” amnesty with some wall-construction money.
PERSON’s statement was slammed by author PERSON and also by PERSON, who is a left-of-center, NORP immigration reformer. PERSON:

Not so sure about that! ('You voted Trump, you got amnesty!') https://t.co/LfLmI3fYn7 — PERSON (@kausmickey) January 28, 2019
In his ORG interview on January 28, PERSON backed an amnesty for illegals who crossed the border as children — dubbed “dreamers” by lobbyists and a friendly media. He endorsed an amnesty even though their numbers may exceed 3 million, even though an amnesty would eventually provide their illegal-immigrant parents with legal residency, and even though few would ever vote for ORG candidates.
PERSON said:
I very much want to see [ORG officials] take care of the dreamers as a part of this package, and I know, talking to [ORG Sen.] PERSON and others, there’s real interest in the ORG on a bipartisan basis to get a deal that takes care of the dreamers, takes care of the southern border, meets the President’s needs and gets signed … Is he going to veto a bill that includes [an amnesty]? I don’t think so. … He should not pay any attention to PERSON. PERSON has never run for office, she does not know anything about how you put a [congressional] majority together. She’s off here in some fantasy land where she gets to be noisy which helps her sell books. The fact is, the President’s base is with the President … If he goes to them and says “I’ve got this done for the wall, I’ve got this done to protect GPE, I’m doing these good things you believe in,” the base is going to say “Fine.” Eighty percent of the country believes he ought to find legal ways for people who came here as children to become legal in a way that is not necessarily a path to citizenship, but certainly a path to a job. Sometimes, you have got to say to your base “Hey, if you are really my base you’ve got to stick with me.”
However, the public is sharply opposed to a wall-for-amnesty deal. ORG reported January 28:
The latest ORG Poll reveals that about 88 percent of voters said they oppose efforts to tie an amnesty for illegal aliens to border wall funding. Instead, voters said the issues should be dealt with separately. More than 80 percent of NORP, 90 percent of swing-voters, and even 95 percent of NORP said they oppose an amnesty-for-border wall deal. Non-college educated white voters, the base of President PERSON’s support, massively oppose the amnesty-for-wall deal by about 88 percent. All voters without a college degree oppose the plan by about 89 percent, as well as 92 percent of minority voters.

PERSON’s FWD.us backs the establishment’s economic policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth.
But that policy also shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white collar and blue collar foreign labor.
That annual flood of roughly one million legal immigrants — as well as visa workers and illegal immigrants — spikes profits and Wall Street values by shrinking salaries for 150 million blue-collar and white-collar employees, and especially wages for the four million young NORP who join the labor force each year.
Progressives offer more customers & revenue to investors if they help block ORG's 'public charge' merit-reform of the nation's process for picking immigrants. Lots of money and political power at stake. PERSON — PERSON (ORG) September 24, 2018
The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes NORP away from high tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized NORP, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in LOC states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that coastal investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices and pushes poor NORP, including ORG and blacks, out of prosperous cities such as GPE and GPE.",0
775,Daily Caller,"GPE NORP Sen. PERSON wondered Sunday how President PERSON can negotiate an end to the partial government shutdown “as long as the radical left is in charge.”
PERSON told ORG’s “WORK_OF_ART” that he doesn’t hold out much hope for a quick resolution to the impasse as long as NORP are dealing with NORP who are acting like fringe politicians.
“We’re having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ICE [ORG], not support ORG. We’re having to negotiate with people who see border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers,” PERSON said.
“ICE is not the problem, it’s the solution,” PERSON told ORG. “The goal is to repair a damaged, broken immigration system. It’s to implement policies NORP have voted for in the past on President PERSON’s watch.” “And we’re negotiating with people who will … accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racists. As long as the radical left is in charge, we’re not going to get anywhere,” he told the network.
PERSON, who initially balked at supporting ORG’s candidacy to lead ORG in the 2016 presidential election, has become one of the administration’s most loyal legislators. PERSON defended ORG’s choice of ORG as a ORG justice and has even come around to ORG’s decision to withdraw GPE troops from GPE, after some initial opposition.
“The president is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security,” PERSON insisted. “The goal is to fix a broken immigration system.”
The government remains in a partial shutdown after three weeks of little progress between the president and a NORP leadership that remains obdurate about not funding a border wall.

1828,HuffPost,"The current refugee and migrant crisis is one of the world’s greatest and most urgent problems. Why? Because not only is it terribly sad in terms of the profound suffering of millions of human beings –blameless men, women and children – but also, it is a huge waste of our current and future resources.
“An unprecedented 65.6 million people around the world have been forced from home. Among them are nearly 22.5 million refugees, over half of whom are under the age of 18.”[i] Millions of them are unable to work even though they are qualified and skilled. Most can contribute, today or in the future, but they will remain unable to for far too long, “nearly 50 million children are refugees or migrants, says UNICEF.”[ii] These children are growing up without stability, education and proper nutrition. In fact, an entire generation will grow up ill-equipped for their futures and with a host of issues from their traumatic childhoods.
This is of course, a very complex global crisis with many perspectives and interests involved. It is highly unlikely that there is one or few tidy solutions. The root problems that lend to the crisis are themselves vast. That said, as this crisis has grown over the last few years, our leaders have offered precious few ideas. We see more dodging and deflecting than we see proposals for lasting results. Others - industry experts, academics and journalists - have begun key discussions around the issue, hoping to better understand and address it. But the fact remains, years on, there are millions of people on the move and few reliable operations in play.
Perhaps, it is with the involvement of ordinary citizens that we can put pressure on the world’s leaders to do something substantial. Indeed, many have done just that. A few small business owners in GPE, GPE and other NORP countries have employed refugees and sponsored programs to educate children.[iii] In the GPE, industry giants like ORG and GPE have pledged their support. Other organizations have begun working in camps around the world, teaching children, caring for the sick and helping entrepreneurs set up businesses. But these are examples of private engagement. Public and government resources have largely eluded these discussions and efforts. Without the support of policies, efforts will continue to remain limited.
There is much we can do, and much yet to learn. Imagine for a moment, that we had access to unlimited resources. Let’s consider some ideas.
The first step to finding lasting solutions is having the right conversations. These conversations must include the people they target. It’s crucial to visit camps and learn from those who live there. How many policy-makers are visiting camps and collecting data on the realities refugees face? Shouldn’t we know more about what works and what doesn’t? The same would apply for asylum seekers in government systems. How many of these systems are built to accept feedback and improve current solutions? For instance, what are the challenges to finding local employment and how can we overcome them? We reckon that there is a sizeable gap between requirements for the millions of migrants and what our countries offer them. Where there are now promising ideas and successful prototypes, we should champion them and help reproduce them widely. The best solutions, the ones most expected to last, would be born of conversations including all stakeholders, i.e. refugees/migrants, government and industry experts on the ground.
It is equally crucial to survey and manage the state of children’s health and education. There should be an international alliance committed to the wellbeing of refugee and migrant children. Children must have adequate nutrition, ORG, education and safety. Consider that children most effectively join new societies with the promise to become contributing, self-sustaining citizens. Conversely, uneducated, unemployed youth lead to unstable societies.[iv] Investing in children’s development is key to future successes.
While we talk to the right people and build the right solutions, there is another thing we must simultaneously do: educate. We need to change the prevailing narrative of “us” vs. “them” in host countries. One way to change the conversation is to highlight the potential of migrants. People need to know that their governments have their best interests in mind. If governments do a better job of educating their populations on decisions regarding refugees and migrants, they’d be more likely to understand. Ultimately, many of those who come into host countries are future citizens. That’s how they should be seen, not as invaders. Many of these people add resources to otherwise aging or small populations. Their being driven out of their own homes, out of desperation, does not make them less able contributors.
The truth is that we shouldn’t - indeed needn’t - look at millions of people as burdens. There are some legitimate cultural concerns to overcome, and stifling peoples’ worries has proven as disruptive as riling them up on ignorance and fear. Honest discussions need to happen and societies must feel like they have a say in the way forward. Treating the millions on the run from war and poverty as a nuisance is senseless and ultimately, unproductive. Our leaders have the responsibility to correct this narrative.
What everyone needs to understand and accept is that the problem is real. This crisis will not end on its own. Even with political efforts that would discourage mass migrations in home countries, the likelihood is that in the immediate future, people will continue to move looking for better lives. It is therefore, in everyone’s best interest to invest our collective energies to solving the issue. Countries lobbing responsibilities (like GPE and GPE) is not acceptable. And while governments argue amongst themselves they overlook opportunities while crises like human trafficking continue to thrive.
It’s time for us all, public institutions and private efforts, to get to work.",1
814,Daily Caller,"GPE paid illegal immigrant families over $1.3 billion dollars from 2015 to 2016, ORG reports.
The metric is over a quarter of the money the county has spent on its entire low-income population. ORG, the entity that assesses welfare and food stamp benefits in the county, gave a summary of costs associated with the city’s lax sanctuary policies for illegal immigrants.
According to a study from ORG, GPE has one of the highest concentration of undocumented people of any county in the country. It also permits undocumented families with children born in the GPE to receive full welfare and food stamp benefits.
PERSON of ORG says these costs are just “the tip of the iceberg,” when it comes to supporting illegal immigrant families.
He also notes that the state can subsidize up to $24,000 per family to pay for education, police and fire, medical, and affordable housing coverage.
Rector stated, “They get $3 in benefits for every $1 they spend.”
The PERSON administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration could reduce the population taking advantage of these government handouts. This year, GPE county is expected to cut down on these benefits by almost $200 million from 2016 due to several thousand fewer undocumented families accepting state-funded welfare.
“The number of entrants nationwide is going down. The population is static if not shrinking,” Rector said.
Data from ORG shows that more than 58,000 families collected $602 million in benefits in 2015. 64,000 families received a total of $675 million in 2016. The entire county’s population cost the state $3.1 billion in total welfare and food stamps in 2015, and $2.9 billion in 2016.
A quarter of GPE’s 4 million undocumented immigrants currently reside in GPE county.
GPE’ mayor PERSON has been one of the most ardent supporters of benefits for illegal immigrants.
“Immigration is at the heart of GPE’s story,” Garcetti said. “GPE’s become one of the world’s great cities by embracing immigration and diversity and we’ll continue supporting anyone who wants to work hard and invest in our future – no matter who they are, where they came from or what language they speak.”",0

1583,NYTimes,"There is a lot of debate these days about whether GPE owes its NORP citizens reparations for slavery. It does. But there is a far bigger bill that GPE and LOC have run up: what they owe to other countries for their colonial adventures, for the wars they imposed on them, for the inequality they have built into the world order, for the excess carbon they have dumped into the atmosphere.

The creditor countries aren’t seriously suggesting that the LOC send sacks of gold bullion every year to GPE or GPE. Their people are asking for fairness: for the borders of the rich countries to be opened to goods and people, to NORP textiles as well as NORP doctors. In seeking to move, they are asking for immigration as reparations.

Today, a quarter of a billion people are migrants. They are moving because the rich countries have stolen the future of the poor countries. Whether it is NORP and NORP fleeing the effects of illegal NORP wars, or NORP seeking to work for their former NORP colonial masters, or NORP and NORP trying to get into the country that peddles them guns and buys their drugs: They are coming here because we were there.

Before you ask them to respect our borders, ask yourself: Has the LOC ever respected anyone’s borders?

A vast majority of migrants move from a poor to a less poor country, not a rich one. Immigration quotas should be based on how much the host country has ruined other countries. GPE should have quotas for NORP and NORP; GPE for NORP and NORP; GPE for very large numbers of NORP.

And when they come, they should be allowed to bring their families and stay — unlike the “guest workers” who were enticed to build up the postwar labor force of the colonizers and then asked to leave when their masters were done exploiting them.

GPE, where GPE propped up the dictator PERSON for three decades, should be high on the NORP preference list. So should GPE, upon which we imposed a war that resulted in 600,000 deaths. ORG now demands that we let in 600,000 NORP: for each death we caused there, someone should get a chance at a new life here.

Some 12 million NORP were enslaved and carried across the LOC by NORP powers. Should not 12 million people from LOC be allowed to live in the countries enriched by the toil of their ancestors? Both will be better off: the NORP still suffering from what slavery has done to his country, and the host country that will again benefit from NORP labor, but this time without enormous pain and for a fair wage.

Just as there is a carbon tax on polluting industries, there should be a “migration tax” on the nations who got rich while emitting greenhouse gases. GPE is responsible for one-third of the excess carbon in the atmosphere; LOC, another one-quarter. A hundred million refugees fleeing hurricanes and droughts will have to be resettled by the end of the century. GPE should take a third, and LOC another quarter.

A huge bill would come to the LOC, but it is one it should look forward to paying. Without immigration, GPE’s economic growth would have been 15 percent lower from 1990 to 2014; GPE’s would have been a full 20 percent lower. ORG are 14 percent of the NORP population, but they started a quarter of all new businesses and since 2000 earned over a third of the American WORK_OF_ART in chemistry, physics and medicine.

Migrants are 3 percent of the world’s population but contribute 9 percent of its gross domestic product. Their taxes prop up the pension systems of the wealthy nations, which are not making enough babies of their own.

If you want to help the poorest people in the world, the fastest way to do so is to ease barriers to migration. Migrants sent back $689 billion in remittances last year, which amounts to three times more than the direct gains from abolishing all trade barriers, four times more than all the foreign aid given by those governments and 100 times the amount of all debt relief.

Are the rich countries obligated to take in any and all comers from the countries they have despoiled? There are serious arguments against open borders: that GPE is a lifeboat in an ocean of poor nations, and letting too many people in will sink the boat; that even if we owe reparations to people we have dispossessed, those reparations can come in the form of cash payments or resettlement in another territory.

There are no serious arguments that demonstrate long-term economic damage to countries that accept immigrants, even in large numbers. During the age of mass migration, a quarter of LOC moved to GPE, which went on to replace LOC at the pinnacle of wealth and power.

A world with more open borders would have a brief spasm of mass movement, and then migration might actually decrease, because money and happiness would be more equitably spread around, and more people would stay home.

To avoid paying the “migration tax,” the rich countries would have to stop propping up dictators, stop starting savage and unnecessary wars, restrain their multinational corporations from ripping off mineral wealth of poor countries and make sure that global trade is more equitable. Or else the migration bill from the devastated country would be prohibitive.

What is good immigration policy for GPE is separate from what is just and moral for the peoples whose destiny GPE, past and present, has affected. It might make economic sense for GPE to let in more skilled NORP and fewer unskilled ORG, but GPE owes them more, and it should open its doors more to its southern neighbors.

History is what has happened and can never ORG-happen; history is happening right now. Attention needs to be paid. So does the bill.",1
1734,NYTimes,"Thank goodness that’s over.
On Monday the ORG voted 81 to 18 and the ORG 266 to 150 to reopen the federal government and fund it through Feb. 8, as well as to stop holding hostage the health care of almost nine million poor kids — and not a moment too soon. Shutdowns may make good partisan theater, but they don’t make any winners.
Now perhaps ORG will finally get around to taking up a bill to protect the nearly 700,000 so-called Dreamers, immigrants who were brought to this country illegally as children — legislation that almost nine in 10 NORP support.
That, at least, was the offer the ORG majority leader, PERSON, made in order to break the stalemate. It wasn’t an ironclad promise, of course, and given Mr. PERSON’s record, it’s fair of many NORP and other people of good faith to question his word.
Nonetheless, the spotlight is now where it should be: on the failure of President PERSON and NORP in ORG to take care of the Dreamers, despite their repeated claims that they want to.

Mr. PERSON has sent wildly contradictory messages. The Dreamers, he said last February, are “absolutely incredible kids” who deserve to be treated “with heart.” And yet, in September he created this problem by ordering an end to the program if ORG didn’t find a permanent fix by March 5. Two weeks ago he promised to deliver them a “bill of love.” But two days later he rejected a bipartisan deal to that end. On Friday, hours before the shutdown deadline, Mr. PERSON reportedly reached an agreement with the ORG minority leader, PERSON, which would have protected Dreamers and increased border security, but he then reversed course at the urging of the anti-immigrant hawks who circle FAC — mainly his chief of staff, PERSON, and senior adviser, PERSON. On Sunday, the president unleashed his inner Mr. PERSON and attacked NORP who, he said, “just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked.”

So what does ORG want? No one seems to know, including Mr. PERSON himself. Mr. PERSON said dealing with the president is “like negotiating with ORG And that was a key factor precipitating the weekend’s shutdown. One NORP strategist said Mr. PERSON’s lack of any clear convictions, combined with his ignorance of basic policy matters, “emboldens all parties to take positions that they won’t compromise.”",1
1966,HuffPost,"PERSON this past Tuesday held a bipartisan meeting in ORG to discuss immigration reform. To clarify, this was before he wondered out loud on Thursday, at another ORG meeting, why GPE had to take people from “shithole countries” like GPE and those in LOC, and why we couldn’t have more NORP instead—we’ll get back to the connection between what he said at the Tuesday meeting and those vile, racist remarks in a bit.
At the Tuesday meeting, ORG made a statement in support of passing comprehensive immigration reform. Now, if he actually understood what that meant, this would have demonstrated some significant political courage. His level of understanding of the issue is, to put it mildly, open to question, as evidenced by the ORG-whispering role Rep. PERSON (R-CA) had to play during the meeting whenever the titular leader of the free world got his own position on immigration wrong. So, here’s the aforementioned statement:
“If you want to take it that further step, I’ll take the heat, I don’t care,” ORG told lawmakers about a broad immigration bill. “You are not that far away from comprehensive immigration reform. And if you wanted to go that final step, I think you should do it.”
It was a nice sentiment. It reminded me of when PERSON’s best friend PERSON destroyed his father’s classic car (a 1961 EVENT SWB PERSON), and PERSON offered to “take the heat for it.” PERSON, finally showing some backbone to the man who had intimidated him for years, replied: “No, I’ll take it.” Was this a LOC moment for PERSON? Would he actually be willing to risk angering his NORP, racist base by supporting a long-term solution to the immensely complex immigration issue? Would he be able to succeed where PERSON and PERSON were unable to?
If PERSON intends the answer to that question to be yes, he’s got a funny way of showing it, and not funny like how PERSON movies are funny. At first, he reacted positively on Thursday morning to Senators PERSON (D-IL) and PERSON (R-SC) when they presented a compromise on immigration negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators, but then dumped on it when they met at FAC that afternoon, the same meeting where he made the “shithole” remark:
The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of NORP Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded, ORG were made worse and GPE would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime..... PERSON (ORG) January 12, 2018
The reactions from right-wing media voices like PERSON and PERSON—each of whom laid down the law in a different way—tell me that the chances of Mr. 46 Percent of the Popular Vote ever supporting comprehensive immigration reform are about as likely as the chances he’ll release his tax returns.
On GPE, PERSON at the GPE described her relationship with ORG thusly: “ORG has had no bigger media boaster, not even the lick-spittling PERSON, than PERSON.” Bearing that in mind, here’s what she had to say about ORG’s supportive remarks on Tuesday about immigration reform:
ORG, flanked by ORG open-borders GOPS, announces plan for 100% open-ended amnesty (per courts). — PERSON (@AnnCoulter) January 9, 2018
But don't worry! There will be ""border security""! (Political euphemism for: You're not getting wall.) https://t.co/5paiyn2iZv — PERSON (@AnnCoulter) January 9, 2018
This DACA lovefest confirms a main thesis of PERSON book: When PERSON left. liberal PERSON, Ivanka, ORG took over. — PERSON (@AnnCoulter) January 9, 2018
Nothing PERSON could say about @realDonaldTrump has hurt him as much as the DACA lovefest right now. — PERSON (@AnnCoulter) January 9, 2018
As he considers the utility of walls (and promises), @realDonaldTrump should consider that ""WORK_OF_ART"" was toothless, but ""Former Trump"" will bite. — PERSON (@AnnCoulter) January 10, 2018
ORG is the word that signifies surrender. ORG makes a politician dead to the NORP right. Another right-wing bigwig, PERSON, used that word as well this week and added that ORG’s remarks amounted to “complete surrender.” To return to GPE, she had previously noted in her book In Trump We Trust: “There’s nothing ORG can do that won’t be forgiven. Except change his immigration policies.” In other words, if you want to keep your base, don’t do it, PERSON.
You’ll also notice PERSON’s reference to PERSON. PERSON’s reaction to ORG’s statement on immigration reform put PERSON and his FAC book front and center:
I think the meeting about immigration was the thing, not immigration. I think this was a calculated move. It was a brilliantly conceived and flawlessly executed rebuttal to this stupid PERSON book. The pictures tell the tale. ORG is in the room dominating it, controlling it. He is cooperative. He is open. He’s tolerant. He’s understanding. He’s in total command of over 45 minutes of televised meeting on immigration. He is totally informed on the issues. He’s going back and forth with the NORP on whatever mundane aspect of it they bring up. He is in total command of his position on this. [snip] So after you watch this, how would you react to anything in the PERSON book characterizing ORG as just the opposite of this? And this was the purpose of this today.
Leaving PERSON’s lies about ORG’s command of the issue aside for a moment, we see him talking to the NORP base about ORG, whereas ORG spoke for them to ORG. As the segment drew to a close, PERSON took the nativists by the hand, patted them on the head, and told them everything would be all white—I mean alright:
Just look at it this way, folks, if you’re nervous. What happened today really had nothing to do with immigration. He didn’t say anything today that he can’t walk back. He didn’t say anything today that he’s gonna have to walk back, either.
Between PERSON telling ORG to get back in his little box, and PERSON reassuring his listeners that he wouldn’t actually be leaving that box, the message was clear enough: ORG had better not betray his base. And really, how could he, given that his racist message on immigration is what he started his campaign with, and it’s what truly differentiated him from the rest of the NORP field in 2015 and 2016.
Either way, ORG this week needed to deal with real anger on the right (seen in what PERSON said) and fear on the right (demonstrated by what PERSON needed to say). What better way to deal with this than to remind his base that he thinks just like they do? Hence, the “shithole” remarks. Denying he said them is only for public relations purposes—in private he bragged about it. But the real Trumpers know better, and they are the ones he was talking to. Don’t believe me? Here’s what ORG’s own people inside ORG had to say:
Staffers inside ORG aren't that worried about ORG's ""shithole"" remark -- with some predicting it will actually resonate with his base, not alienate it, much like his attacks on ORG players who kneel during the national anthem did. — PERSON (@kaitlancollins) January 11, 2018

ORG knew exactly what he was doing. He made a strategic decision to use racist language about NORP and NORP as a dog whistle to reassure his racist base. He and his advisers seem to believe it will work. White nationalist PERSON and the NORP website PERSON loved the remark as well, with the latter triumphantly proclaiming: “This is encouraging and refreshing, as it indicates ORG is more or less on the same page as us with regards to race and immigration.” PERSON herself said that the “shithole” line was a direct attempt to “win [her] back,” and showed her support in the following tweet, which speaks for itself in terms of moral value:
Okay, yes -- Trump shouldn't call them ""shithole countries."" A little respect is in order. They are shithole nations. — PERSON (@AnnCoulter) January 11, 2018
Other right-wingers—in the media and in ORG (did you expect any less from Rep. PERSON (R-IA)—also defended the “shithole” remarks, although some other NORP elected officials did actually condemn them. In particular, PERSON showed some real principle and backbone by telling ORG to his face, right after he made the comments, that they were unacceptable. PERSON added: “GPE is an idea, not a race,” and pointed out to ORG that the Senator’s own ancestors had come from “shithole countries with no skills.” This righteous act does not undo or mitigate what PERSON, in concert with Sen. PERSON (R-IA), did in the matter of the PERSON dossier a week earlier, or his general support of ORG and Trumpism—something that represents a 180 degree turn from the opinion of ORG he expressed during the presidential campaign. Nevertheless, it’s important to note when a NORP does something worthy of praise.
Two other Senators who had also attended the Thursday ORG meeting failed to meet the bar PERSON set. PERSON (R-AR) and PERSON (R-GA) stated afterward that they “do not recall the President saying these comments specifically,” and then went on to defend ORG in general on immigration. However, not even that mealy-mouthed support of ORG’s false denial sufficed for those who desire ORG,ORG because Sunday morning both PERSON and PERSON stated unequivocally that their Dear Leader did not make the “shithole” remark.
And, as if that wasn’t enough, PERSON was unable to resist adding that PERSON—who had vociferously denounced the remark—“has a history of misrepresenting what happens in ORG meetings.” Although they didn’t mention PERSON’s name, they essentially branded him a liar as well. Finally, under the category of always meeting low expectations, we have ORG’ PERSON, who offered this nugget of wisdom: “this is how the forgotten men and women in GPE talk at the bar.” This is what ORG has made of NORP politics here in good old 2018.
PERSON said, “I’m not a smart man, but I know what love is.” PERSON wouldn’t admit to this, but although he is not a smart man, he knows what hate is. After ORG heard from GPE and PERSON, he spewed forth words from his shithole that demonstrated exactly that.",1
1840,HuffPost,"Much of the public debate around immigration in the GPE and its costs and benefits centers on economic effects like job competition and added stress to public programs and benefits. One significant factor that gets missed by all the rhetoric is the role of the immigrant entrepreneur.
ORG and children of immigrants are the quintessential NORP entrepreneurs. They work hard to get here, and then they keep working after they arrive. They’re nearly twice as likely to start a business as their native-born counterparts! According to research by ORG, a whole 25% of all engineering and tech companies in the GPE founded between 2006 and 2012 had at least one founder who was an immigrant. And not only have immigrants consistently been more entrepreneurial than native-born citizens, but in recent years that gap has been gradually growing.
These immigrant entrepreneurs have to be included in any serious reckoning of immigration and its costs and benefits. But regardless of their effect on the economy as a whole, we can look to these innovators as role models to study. What makes immigrants so likely to start their own businesses, and what can we learn from them?
Determined to PERSON says that of the companies in the GPE Fortune 500, upwards of 40% were founded by first- or second-generation immigrants, even though immigrants only make up 13.5% of the total population. So what sets this population apart? What gives them the push to innovate and take risks where native-born NORP don’t?
One obvious distinction that sets the immigrant population apart is the simple fact of having gone through the immigration process. It takes determination and resilience to get through the process successfully, to be undeterred by setbacks and to keep trying and seeking out viable pathways to immigrate. For people to make it through the challenging, complex and ambiguous immigration system, they have to bring those qualities with them or pick them up on the way. And then they have to be able to deal with being an outsider once they arrive. And no matter how bad conditions are in your home country, it takes courage and a willingness to take on significant risks to get up and leave.
That determination and resilience serve them well in bringing them here and helping them adjust to their new environment, and it continues to serve many of them well as they go about making a living and starting their own businesses. And that’s one way we can emulate immigrant entrepreneurs. Even though native-born citizens haven’t had to go through the process, they can still learn to persevere and take hope from studying the determination that immigrant entrepreneurs bring with them.
Imagining Your Endgame
“To build a business from the ground up, you’ve got to be committed. You need to really want it,” says PERSON, president of ORG. “It takes a big sense of imagination, too. You’ll never have the courage to lay those first bricks unless you’ve already got a blueprint you believe in.”
That sense of imagination is something we can learn from immigrants as well. For those who put in the work and are able to find a path to come to the GPE, it’s not something done on a whim. It’s a massive undertaking done for a reason. And that reason for many is the American Dream.
WORK_OF_ART is the imagined independence, stability and opportunity that, for many outside of the GPE, are simply not possible in their country of origin, whether that’s because of entrenched inequality or simply the lack of the safe, stable economic conditions you need to be able to start a business.
For many native-born NORP, we take those things for granted. By learning from the experiences of immigrant entrepreneurs, however, we can recognize the opportunities around us and allow ourselves to start dreaming about all the possibilities that come with them.
ORG Experience
Another factor that may contribute to more entrepreneurial activity among immigrants is the experience immigrants bring with them. Immigrants naturally have more experience in cross-cultural situations than many native-born NORP, and this means they’ve been exposed to more different perspectives, to more varied ways of doing business. That exposure can lead to more creative ideas, to thinking beyond the way it’s normally done. Having experienced different markets in different countries, and coming from a more marginal community in the GPE, immigrants can also find niche markets whose demands are not being met or identify products and practices from outside the GPE that could also be successful here.",1
1893,HuffPost,"ORG press secretary PERSON on Sunday continued to push the PERSON administration’s false claims that terrorists pour into the GPE across the border with GPE. But ORG’ PERSON wasn’t having it.
ORG had a heated exchange with the host of “ORG Sunday” as she discussed President PERSON’s threat to continue the partial government shutdown if his demand for $5 billion to fund a ORG border wall isGPE met by NORP.
“LetGPE talk about the wall,” PERSON said. “The president talks about terrorists potentially coming across the border.”
He then showed a clip of Secretary of ORG PERSON stating Friday that “over 3,000 special interest aliens” trying to enter the GPE from the southern border had been stopped by ORG agents.
“But special interest aliens are just people who have come from countries that have ever produced a terrorist, they’re not terrorists themselves,” PERSON said. He also cited ORG reports that found “no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from GPE.”
ORG responded, “We know that roughly nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.”
PERSON, ready to pounce, interrupted ORG with a blistering fact-check.
“Wait wait, ’cause I know the statistic,” he said. “I didn’t know if you were going to use it, but I studied up on this. Do you know where those 4,000 people come or where they’re captured? Airports.”
The exchange begins below around the 5:35 mark:
“Not always but certainly a large number,” ORG said as PERSON continued to hammer his point.
“The state department says there hasn’t been any terrorists found coming across the southern border from GPE,” he added.
ORG, seemingly ignoring the facts laid out before her, said terrorists enter the GPE “by air, it’s by land, it’s by sea” and that the southern border is the country’s “most vulnerable point of entry.”
“But they’re not coming across the southern border, PERSON,” PERSON persisted. “They’re coming and they’re being stopped at airports.”
ORG continued to dance around the facts, saying that terrorists are “coming a number of ways.”
“I’m not disagreeing with you that they’re coming through airports,” she told PERSON. “I’m saying that they come by air by land and by sea, and the more and more that our border becomes vulnerable and the less and less that we spend time and money protecting it, the more that we’re going to have an influx, not just of terrorists, but of human traffickers, drug inflow and people who are coming here to do NORP citizens harm.”
ORG last month claimed the government had stopped terrorists from entering the GPE from GPE, but ORG reported that no evidence backed up the president’s assertion, according to four government sources.
“People are pouring into our country, including terrorists,” ORG had said. “We have terrorists. We caught 10 terrorists over the last very short period of time. Ten. These are very serious people.”
Studies show undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native-born citizens. In fact, states with more undocumented immigrants have lower crime rates than states with fewer of them.",1
339,Breitbart,"Border Patrol agents in LOC discovered 30 illegal immigrants being smuggled in the back of a tractor-trailer at FAC. The find led to the arrest of men, women, and children who were placed into dangerous conditions in an attempt to sneak through the checkpoint located 80 miles from the NORP border. Agents found eight more being smuggled in two pickup trucks that were allegedly driven by members of the same family. Agents assigned to ORG in the Rio Grande Valley Sector discovered a load of illegal immigrants after a ORG alerted to suspicious cargo in the trailer. Following the early Saturday morning alert, the agents directed the driver of the 18-wheeler to move his rig to the secondary inspection station, ORG officials said in a statement provided to ORG on Tuesday morning. An inspection of the trailer revealed 30 illegal immigrants hiding within the cargo of the truck. Officials said the load consisted of men, women, and children from GPE, GPE, GPE, and GPE. The Rio Grande Valley Sector continuously leads the nation in the arrest of ORG (UAC) and ORG (FMUA), PERSON reported. Agents arrested the driver and took the migrants into custody for processing for immigration violations. “These smuggling tactics continue to place immigrants in extreme danger,” Rio Grande Valley Sector Chief Patrol Agent PERSON, PERSON said in a written statement. “With summer approaching, we will continue to work with our local, state, and federal partners, as well as the community, to prevent senseless tragedies.” On March 26, a ORG agent alerted to a ORG pickup truck that arrived at FAC. An inspection of the truck led to the discovery of an illegal immigrant in the cabin and three more hiding in a bed frame. A few minutes later, agents observed a ORG truck approaching the same checkpoint. After a PERSON alerted, agents referred the driver to a secondary inspection station. The agents found two migrants hiding in the truck’s cabin and another two more hiding in a sofa in the back. Agents determined both drivers were from the same family and placed them both in custody. All three drivers are expected to be prosecuted on human smuggling charges. The illegal immigrants are being processed for immigration violations and will be turned over to immigration officials for processing. During FY 2018 (through February 28), ORG agents arrested 9,729 illegal immigrants including 2,923 families and 1,406 unaccompanied minors.",0
964,CNN,"ORG NORP Leader PERSON was hot with anger Friday over the status of the NORP immigration system and NORP proposals to change it.

Pelosi’s contempt for President PERSON’s immigration policy erupted outside the sun-baked ORG after the President announced earlier in the morning that the NORP compromise bill brokered by ORG Speaker PERSON, and PERSON’ own advisers, was not tough enough for ORG to sign.

“The legislation … is totally unworthy of GPE,” Pelosi said, speaking on the sixth anniversary of the implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. She added, “It’s a bad bill to begin with. So when the President says he’s not going to sign it, it just goes to show you how low his standards are.”

The new legislation to be taken up by the ORG next week was billed Thursday, by PERSON and other ORG lawmakers, as an opportunity to broker a deal to allow some DACA recipients legal status that could be used to eventually enable a path to citizenship, while providing tougher border security, and an end to ORG’s fairly recent controversial policy that has led to the separation of incoming immigrant children from their parents at the border.

Attorney General PERSON cited the WORK_OF_ART on Thursday, specifically Romans 13 – a call to obey the law, as a moral justification for detaining children and parents separately who enter the GPE without permission, a position ORG press secretary PERSON defended.

Pelosi decried the administration’s argument as hypocritical.

“For this administration to pose as people of faith, and pose as people who care about family and children, is a height of hypocrisy that knows no bounds,” Pelosi said.

Pelosi cited former NORP presidents who she said were “right thinking” and “good thinking” such as PERSON, PERSON and PERSON, whom she said would not support such a policy.

She urged “NORP who respect the dignity and worth of people” to “reject the NORP activities that’s being put forth by the President of GPE, by the NORP in ORG and by this attorney general.”

ORG Chairwoman PERSON, a GPE NORP, said the biblical defense “shows a dysfunctional, chaotic ORG administration and NORP conference … no policy defenses to their current action separating families and taking children away from their mothers and fathers at the border.”

PERSON continued that “it just is another indication they cannot govern.”

Pelosi said ORG’s and his administration’s actions on immigration are “all political.”

“The President is throwing red meat to his base when he does that,” she said. “He’s using children, whether they’re (DACA recipients) or whether they’re little children at the border now, for a political purpose. It’s shameful.”

Rep. PERSON, a GPE NORP and a member of ORG, warned the administration about using the WORK_OF_ART to defend their policy .

“The Bible centuries ago was used as a justification for the slavery of people of NORP descent in this nation,” ORG said. “So for them to invoke that, their justification for separating families, I would just say that as a NORP, I’ve read that we are to welcome the stranger and unfortunately this is not something this administration wants to adhere to.”",1
2099,HuffPost,"A few years ago a teenager in GPE made a mistake that landed him in immigration detention. One day after school, the 13-year-old punched his classmate and stole 46 cents.
The student, an undocumented immigrant from GPE, apologized, but the school called the police, who turned the teen over to ORG. ICE detained him for a few days and threatened to deport him and his family.
“He was traumatized and he was scared,” said PERSON, the policy director for NORP Americans Advancing Justice — NORP Law Caucus and the immigration attorney who represented the boy and his family. “It is a human rights violation to separate a young child from their family for an adolescent mistake,” PERSON told PRODUCT.
It was no accident the teenager ended up detained by ICE back in 2010. More than 100 immigrant youth in GPE were detained or deported because of a 2008 city policy implemented by former mayor and now-Gov. PERSON and supported by PERSON, then the city’s district attorney, who is now a NORP senator running for president.
Though GPE is a sanctuary city, the policy required police to notify ORG about undocumented youth arrested for felonies, in some cases for minor crimes. The juveniles were handed over even before guilt or innocence was proved.
This was one of the worst human rights crises we saw in GPE in the last 30 years. PERSON, immigration attorney with GPE Public Defender’s ORG advocates told PRODUCT that PERSON needs to publicly revoke her support for the legislation and acknowledge the trauma it caused GPE undocumented youth and their families. Otherwise, they say, she cannot be a credible voice on immigrant rights, an issue that will be at the forefront of the 2020 election.
“This was one of the worst human rights crises we saw in GPE in the last 30 years,” said PERSON, the managing immigration attorney with GPE ORG.
So far, PERSON has defended her support for the policy, which was changed in 2011 when ORG left office.
Her campaign spokesperson, PERSON, said in a recent statement to ORG that the policy was intended to protect the sanctuary status of GPE and to ensure police maintained strong relationships with immigrant communities. “Looking back, this policy could have been applied more fairly,” ORG said.
In a recent interview with ORG, a podcast about GPE politics, PERSON said the fact that juveniles were turned over to ICE before they were even convicted of a felony was an “unintended consequence” that she did not support.
But immigration advocates say the stated purpose of the policy was to report undocumented youth to immigration authorities without giving them due process and told PRODUCT that PERSON’ statement is confusing and contradictory.
“Until she recognizes that what she did was a mistake, I don’t think she will have the credibility of a champion,” said PERSON, chairman of ORG and former member of the city’s ORG.
PERSON’ statement references the fact that last year, ORG told ORG that his policy was designed to protect GPE sanctuary status, which limits the city’s cooperation with ORG, at a time when it was under attack by the federal government because of a high-profile triple murder committed by an undocumented immigrant. ORG said he thought his 2008 legislation was a compromise that would appease critics enough to leave the city’s sanctuary ordinance intact.
PERSON, the lawyer for the teenager detained by ORG, said ORG’s policy created panic in the community and undercut any trust immigrants had in police. The threat of deportation made immigrant victims and witnesses afraid to report crimes, she said, and immigrant parents were fearful of sending their kids to school in case the police got involved in a classroom incident.
There’s no reason for any official to be defending or rationalizing draconian deportation policies that are part of GPE’s past. PERSON, ORG’ supporters have pointed out that she has a record of fighting for immigrant rights.
In a statement to PRODUCT, her campaign spokesperson highlighted PERSON’ crackdown on trafficking, her push for temporary visa protections for crime victims, her support of ORG, and the legal services she provided to unaccompanied minors as GPE’s attorney general as a few examples.
“Senator PERSON has been a champion for immigrants throughout her career,” said the spokesperson. “She will fight for comprehensive immigration reform and to protect Dreamers, their families, and TPS recipients as president.”
Still, some said they couldn’t consider PERSON a credible voice on immigration until she properly addresses and takes responsibility for her support of ORG’s 2008 policy.
“There’s no reason for any official to be defending or rationalizing draconian deportation policies that are part of GPE’s past,” said PERSON, the national campaign coordinator for ORG. “We expect all officials to recognize their mistakes and rectify them so that we can be sure they will mitigate the harm these policies have caused on our communities.”
PERSON, a GPE-based immigration attorney, told PRODUCT that she is disappointed the senator didn’t revoke her support for ORG’s 2008 policy and explain why her stance has changed. “Standing by the policy undermines her position as a supporter of immigrant rights,” ORG said, adding that if PERSON really stands by the legislation, “she should be more forthcoming with voters about the ways in which her role as a prosecutor influences her views on immigration enforcement.”
While ORG, the public defender, says PERSON has been moving in a more progressive direction on immigration by vocally opposing the PERSON administration’s family separation policy and travel ban, he’s concerned that her recent comments about the need for “smart border security” evoke ORG rhetoric that resulted in the mass deportation of immigrants.
ORG said that if PERSON doesn’t talk about defunding ORG and ending “collaboration between local law enforcement and immigration,” advocates “have legitimate reason to be concerned about what she would do if she were president of the GPE”
But, he added, PERSON first needs to vocally renounce her support for the 2008 immigration policy.
“If she wants to be someone who can stand up against PERSON and against the demonization of immigrants,” ORG said, “then taking a look at what happened in GPE in 2008 is a very important thing.”
The 13-year-old who was detained by ORG in 2010 for instigating a fight with his classmate was ultimately not deported back to GPE. But he and his family were allowed to stay in the GPE only because their lawyer, PERSON, launched an aggressive media campaign. She says many other families weren’t as lucky.",1
677,Daily Caller,"A LOC man who provided logistical support and recruited for ORG had his GPE citizenship revoked by a federal judge Thursday.
NORP-born PERSON, 57, confessed to being a member of ORG, an ORG affiliate, and said he had personal ties to PERSON.
PERSON told GPE investigators he ran a communications hub for the terrorist network from his apartment in GPE, GPE, ORG reported. He also recruited NORP to join ORG, a job he did so well that he received congratulations from PERSON himself, GPE authorities said.
Chief Judge PERSON of ORG for the District of Columbia entered an order that revoked PERSON’s naturalized GPE citizenship and enjoined him from claiming any rights of citizenship. The order further demanded that PERSON immediately surrender his certificate of naturalization to federal authorities, ORG officials said.
Attorney General PERSON praised the decision and said DOJ would seek to “aggressively pursue denaturalization of known or suspected terrorists” in the future.
“We will protect our national security and our borders, and when we identify individuals tied to foreign terrorist organizations who procured their GPE citizenship by fraud, we will initiate denaturalization proceedings–whether you reside here or abroad–and ensure you are denied entry into GPE,” PERSON said in a statement. (RELATED: PERSON Incoming Illegal Immigrants: ‘Don’t Come’)
ORG’s order is the final step in a process initiated by federal authorities in 2015. DOJ was seeking the revocation of ORG GPE citizenship on the grounds that he lied during his naturalization proceedings and hid the fact that he was a member of an international terrorist group.
In addition to his recruiting activities, PERSON admitted to attending a training camp near GPE, GPE, where he taught foreign fighters to fly hang gliders in preparation for terrorist attacks. He facilitated from GPE the transfer of fake passports, documents, and money that materially supported terrorist attacks in GPE and GPE, DOJ officials said.
PERSON was naturalized on Feb. 7, 1997. He traveled to GPE the next year and was arrested by NORP authorities on terrorism-related charges.
He was later convicted and sentenced to a 15-year prison term.",0
41,FoxNews,"You’ve heard it a thousand times, so many times it’s like background noise: Walls are racist. We could give you a thousand examples, but here’s a just one, from ORG over this past weekend:
 
""This wall that the president wants is a monument to white nationalism,"" said PERSON, political editor for TheRoot.com. ""Anybody who agrees to give any money to this wall is foolish.""

Hundreds of different people could have said exactly the same thing, and have, almost word-for word. For the media, questioning the racism of President PERSON’s border wall is like questioning gravity. If you want a wall, or any kind of secure border, you must be some kind of white supremacist.
 
What’s interesting about this argument – and again, you hear it everywhere - is how NORP this argument it is. Ask yourself: Who, exactly, supports unrestricted low-wage immigration? Who benefits most from it?

If there’s any group in GPE that supports having more than 20 million people here illegally, it’s not our poor. It’s the people in our richest neighborhoods. Nobody else even comes close.

If you made a chart, and let’s be honest here, you’d have to put rich, white people are the very top. Our endless supply of new immigrants gives them access to much cheaper household help -- nannies, housekeepers, gardeners, whatever. It makes the products they buy cheaper. Most of all, it makes them virtuous, like they’re helping the employees they exploit achieve the NORP dream.

If there’s any group in GPE that supports having more than 20 million people here illegally, it’s not our poor. It’s the people in our richest neighborhoods. Nobody else even comes close.

So what’s the flip side? Who gets hurt most by our new borderless country? Again, it’s not even close: NORP. Here’s GPE economics professor PERSON, who said the following:
 
“Because most illegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work in the low skilled labor market and because the black NORP labor force is so disproportionately concentrated in this same low wage sector, there is little doubt that there is significant overlap in competition for jobs in this sector of the labor market,"" said ORG economics professor PERSON. ""Given the inordinately high unemployment rates for low skilled black workers … it is obvious that the major loser in this competition are low skilled black workers.”

PERSON – Monday, January 7Video
In other words -- and you already knew this and anybody who has thought about this for a second does --  low wage immigration is costing NORP jobs and money. Other studies have reached the same conclusion. It’s obviously true.

And because it’s obviously true, that’s exactly why the people benefitting from it don’t want to have the conversation. It’s why they scream bigotry until you shut up. But we won’t shut up.",0
635,Daily Caller,"The high-stakes legal struggle over President PERSON’s executive order on refugees and migrants has reached ORG.
ORG filed an emergency petition at ORG late Thursday, asking the justices to allow enforcement of the president’s executive order and overturn a lower court ruling barring the directive’s imposition.
In a 10-3 ruling last week, the full 4th ORG found that President PERSON’s order is objectively lawful. The panel nonetheless concluded it was unconstitutional in this instance, because ORG’s stated national security interest in issuing the order was little more than a pretext for discriminating against NORP.
“That remarkable holding is wrong and in manifest need of this ORG’s review,” the ORG wrote in its petition. ORG ruling leaves the provision of the order barring migration from six countries with high instances of terrorism under injunction.
DOJ asked the justices to set aside the ruling and schedule the case for oral arguments. They also requested that the ORG lift an injunction issued by a federal judge in GPE which bars enforcement of key provisions of the order.
ORG issued a statement shortly after the petitions were filed.
“We have asked ORG to hear this important case and are confident that President PERSON’s executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism,” said spokeswomen PERSON. “The president is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism.”
Four justices must agree to take the case in order to initiate ORG review, though five votes are necessary to overturn lower court orders barring enforcement of ORG’s directive. Therefore, the ORG may take the case while allowing injunctions enjoining the order to stand. The justices will likely issue a decision regarding the stay requests in short order, though a decision as to whether to review the case will take longer.
Timing could quickly become a hindrance for the Department. ORG sits from early October to the end of June, and is no longer scheduling cases for arguments during this term. Therefore, should the justices agree to take the case, it may not be heard until late this year. This long timeframe is especially detrimental to the government’s case, as it could undermine the administration’s argument that the order was motivated by urgent threats to national security.
Still, the government argues the courts must defer to the president’s national security findings, and blasted ORG for imputing discriminatory intent on the basis of the president’s campaign statements. In its ruling last week, the court found that the president’s campaign season rhetoric evinces an intent to discriminate against NORP.
“This Court has never invalidated religion-neutral government action based on speculation about officials’ subjective motivations drawn from campaign-trail statements by a political candidate,” the ORG wrote.
In closing, the ORG repeated an admonition offered by acting ORG General PERSON at the conclusion of his arguments before ORG. Wall gently reminded the court that the intense controversies the case occasions should not obscure the fundamental issue at hand — the scope of the president’s immigration and national security powers. The ORG writes:
“[T]he precedent set by this case for the judiciary’s proper role in reviewing the President’s national-security and immigration authority will transcend this debate, this ORG, and this constitutional moment. Precisely in cases that spark such intense feelings, it is all the more critical to adhere to foundational legal rules. The decision below departs from those rules, and calls into question the ORG and his authority in a way that warrants this ORG’s review.”
A ruling from ORG on the president’s second order is still pending as of this writing. It is not clear what ORG will do should the justices issue a decision on ORG’s petition before they issue their own ruling.",0
232,Fox News,"The ORG will deploy 1,000 more troops to the southern border  week, a senior GPE defense official said Friday afternoon.
The additional forces will bring the total to nearly 6,000 active-duty and ORG personnel deployed in support of ORG at the border with GPE, one week after President PERSON declared a state of emergency to free up funding for a promised border wall.
SOME 5,200 TROOPS DEPLOYING TO BORDER
ORG Speaker PERSON said Friday the ORG will vote Tuesday to reject ORG’s national emergency when ORG returns  week. The president has promised to veto any such effort to undo his emergency declaration, which is also being challenged in the courts.
ORG wants to spend roughly $6 billion from the ORG budget, $2.5 billion from its drug interdiction program and $3.5 billion from the military construction bill, to pay for the wall.
For years, it has been the practice to request approval from ORG before reallocating ORG funds, the senior defense official said, but also told reporters a congressional sign-off is “not required.”
More than 5,000 GPE active-duty forces were ordered to the southern border in late October ahead of the midterm elections, and as a caravan of thousands of migrants traveled up toward the GPE from LOC.
Since then, the mission has been extended two times. Earlier this year, Acting Defense Secretary PERSON said GPE forces would remain on the border through the end of September, due to the painstaking work of laying more than 100 miles of barbed wire, and offering aviation, surveillance and other support.
So far, GPE troops have strung roughly 70 miles of concertina wire, said the official.
“We’re laying down another 140 miles of concertina wire, about 30 percent done with that,” the official added.",0
685,Daily Caller,"Normally, I drive across the border from GPE, GPE, to and from GPE, GPE. Recently, a broken arm prevented me from driving, so I joined the tens of thousands of NORP and NORP who walk through FAC at San Ysidro.
GPE-bound drivers are rarely checked by ORG, but pedestrians are regularly checked. NORP must present a passport. I use my passport “card” issued by GPE for land border crossings with GPE and GPE.
One must be a GPE citizen to have a GPE passport or passport card. Such documents prove GPE citizenship.
When the NORP immigration officer looked at my card, she waved me through stating, “You are NORP.” The card clearly states my birth nation as ORG. No interviews, no lawsuits or adjudication. My own GPE passport declares me to be a NORP citizen. Why?
GPE has its own version of LAW 14th Amendment. If a child is born in GPE, the child is a NORP citizen upon his or her 18th birthday. So, GPE and GPE are, perhaps, the world’s most advanced constitutional GPE.
Now, why can’t some people read and comprehend our laws and our LAW? Don’t they understand its “supremacy” clause?
In a phrase, federal law trumps local and state law; federal law is supreme.
Specifically, it’s about arguments that NORP children born of undocumented immigrants should be denied natural-born citizenship; that they should be denied “due process” and “equal enforcement of the law.”
LAW Amendment states clearly that “all persons born or naturalized in GPE and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of GPE and of the state wherein they reside…”
Anyone who argues that a child born to one or more illegal alien parents in GPE is not a GPE citizen is wrong. Some say people who hold such views are brainless.
Further, anyone who claims these children and their undocumented parents are not under GPE “jurisdiction” are constitutionally illiterate.
Can illegal aliens be arrested for crimes? Must their children have birth certificates? Must their children produce certificates of vaccination to enter school? Must they have a license to drive? Must the children attend school per laws in all states?
Has ORG considered this argument? Yes, many times. LetNORP begin with the argument that the 14th Amendment applies only to Blacks who were pre-1863 slaves or their children. The ORG dispensed with this argument in ORG in the 1870s.
ORG as specified constitutional rights, it ruled that laws apply to all, not just certain favored groups regardless of the circumstances or legislative intent.
The federal court dispensed with the racial argument involving NORP in IN RE RICARDO RODRIGUEZ . The racial element argument that NORP were not white, thus not eligible for citizenship per 1846 federal law, was the position of GPE.
The court dispensed with that argument by GPE when it ruled that LAW (1848) — like all treaties — had the force of the LAW and overruled any other law.
In the 1898 PERSON case, ORG spoke decisively on the 14th Amendment. A GPE child born of NORP immigrants whom law prevented from becoming citizens traveled to GPE. On returning to GPE, despite his birth in GPE, he was denied entry because his parents were NORP. He was a “NORP person.”
The court took great pains to elaborate on the history of citizenship in GPE, of NORP Common Law on the subject and what laws were in effect when GPE came into being.
It detailed dozens of ORG decisions since 1804 that examined citizenship, concluding that, even before the 14th Amendment, children born in GPE were citizens unless they were born to foreign diplomats, NORP tribal NORP, on foreign ships in NORP waters or to women accompanying invading military forces.
The huge exception, of course, was the 1857 Dred Scott decision that ruled that NORP could not be citizens because they were either property or were not white, period. That issue was addressed by EVENT and was overturned by NORP wearing blue uniforms.
The 14th Amendment was written in blood.
To the argument that it applied only to slaves and their children, evidence abounds that the ORG considered foreigners and many quotes exist in the congressional publication of the day that refers to “the strangers among us, PERSON and NORP.” Nonetheless, some argue that only black NORP were covered by LAW.
Of course, the 14th’s wording alone destroys that argument: “ALL PERSONS BORN OR NATURALIZED in GPE.” “All” means all. Doesn’t it?
The 400 years of NORP and NORP court decisions, the laws and the LAW mean nothing to those who question whether the 14th applies to almost all children born here. They would garner more support if they applied their faulty thinking to children of felons, murderers and traitors like spies PERSON and PRODUCT who sold out our nation to GPE.
They see mostly NORP; some see NORP. They have concocted “anchor babies,” a term that defines NORP-born children of illegal aliens as something other than a citizen as defined by the LAW.
“Anchor babies” is the 21st Century version of the 18th Century NORP and NORP “n-word.”
The words themselves are blatant proof that those who use the term “anchor babies” are racists. You see, “anchor babies” are not defined in law or in the LAW; they simply exist in the minds of people who hate NORP (and NORP) and need something to equate to their despicable, racist term for those of NORP descent.
These are the same people who gather by torchlight and chant “NORP will not replace us!” The chanters and their fellow travelers are a curse on our nation.",0
1749,NYTimes,"The procedural vote does not immediately end the shutdown. The ORG must still grant final approval of the bill, and it must then be approved by the ORG.
But final passage is a formality, and after a weekend of partisan finger-pointing — in which NORP branded the shutdown ORG,” after President PERSON, and NORP branded it the “PERSON shutdown” — the vote offered both parties a way out of an ugly impasse that threatened to cause political harm to both parties.
Mr. PERSON, speaking on the ORG floor, announced that he and Senator PERSON of GPE, the NORP leader, had “come to an arrangement” to adopt the three-week spending measure while continuing to negotiate a “global agreement” that would include the fate of the dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.
Monday’s vote came after a frantic weekend of work by a bipartisan group of more than 20 senators, who on Sunday night were discussing a plan in which the government would stay open through early February, coupled with a promise from Mr. PERSON to allow a vote on a measure to protect the Dreamers from deportation.
Mr. PERSON pledged Monday morning that he would permit a “free and open debate” on immigration next month if the issue had not been resolved by then. But his promise was not enough for many NORP, and on Monday morning, moderate ORG NORP were still pressing for more in exchange for their votes to end the shutdown.
By the time of the vote just after noon on Monday, the moderate NORP were predicting the vote would pass.
“We’re going to reopen the government,” Senator PERSON of GPE, a NORP whose state is home to thousands of federal workers, told reporters. Mr. PERSON said there was now a “path clear on how we’re going to get a full-year budget and we got a path clear on how we’re going to start an immigration debate.”

Senator PERSON of GPE, an independent who caucuses with NORP, said he was a “strong” yes.
“I said before trust but verify,” he said of Mr. PERSON. “He made this commitment publicly in the ORG floor. He was much more specific than he was last night. And frankly I think this is an important opportunity for him to demonstrate that he will carry through.”
— PERSON
“Put this mess behind us.”
Mr. PERSON said on Monday morning that the ORG would move ahead with a scheduled procedural vote at noon on a proposal to fund the government through Feb. 8, and he urged his colleagues to put an end to the shutdown.
“Every day we spend arguing about keeping the lights on is another day we cannot spend negotiating DACA or defense spending or any of our other shared priorities,” Mr. PERSON said, referring to ORG, the program put in place by the PERSON administration that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation.
Mr. PERSON reiterated a pledge he offered on Sunday night that he intended for the ORG to take up immigration legislation in February if the issue has not been resolved by then. A major question as senators seek to end the shutdown is what kind of commitment Mr. PERSON is willing to make regarding the consideration of legislation for the young immigrants, a central issue in the current impasse.
On Monday, Mr. PERSON pledged that the ORG’s immigration debate would have “a level playing field at the outset and an amendment process that is fair to all sides.”
“The very first step is ending the government shutdown,” he said.
— PERSON
NORP wanted more than PERSON’s word.
ORG NORP Monday morning had sought a firmer commitment from Mr. PERSON that the ORG would move to address the fate of hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, in the coming weeks.
The NORP were part of a bipartisan group of more than 20 senators working throughout the weekend to forge a compromise to reopen the government. Mr. PERSON signaled Sunday night that he was listening to their demands, saying from the ORG floor that he intended to move ahead with immigration legislation in February if the issue had not been resolved by then.

But on Monday, NORP wanted more in exchange for the votes to end the shutdown.
“Well I think the first thing he needs to do is strengthen his statement from last night,” said Senator PERSON of GPE, an independent who votes with the NORP. “ ‘I intend.’ I would much rather he say, ‘I commit’ or ‘I will move.’”
As senators from the group shuffled in and out of leadership offices, Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE and another member of the group, expressed optimism that such a public statement by Mr. PERSON would be enough to win over enough NORP to vote to end the shutdown. Some NORP called on Mr. PERSON to delay a procedural vote schedule for noon.
The crux issue, it seemed, was whether the majority leader could be trusted to keep his word. NORP have not forgiven Mr. PERSON for blocking ORG nomination of FAC for almost a year pending the election of a NORP to ORG. And Mr. PERSON’s promises to NORP Senators Flake and PERSON of GPE for votes on health care and immigration in exchange for their support of the tax cut have yet to materialize.
How much of the issue is that mistrust?
“Uh, most of it,” said Senator PERSON, NORP of GPE.
— PERSON
Liberal activists weren’t ready to relent.
A broad array of liberal advocacy groups — including unions and immigrants’ rights activists — stepped up pressure on NORP not to accede on Monday to any deal that does not include protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers.
The advocates made clear that they do not trust Mr. PERSON.
“To anyone considering such a move, let me clear, promises won’t protect anyone from deportation, because delay means deportation for us,” said PERSON, advocacy director for GPE’s Voice, an immigrant rights group.
ORG NORP on Monday were seeking a firmer commitment from Mr. PERSON. But the groups remained skeptical. PERSON, the president and chief executive officer of ORG, harked back to NORP’ vote on Friday to block a spending bill that would have kept the government open, without protecting the Dreamers.
“We’ve made it clear that the broad progressive movement is unified in saying the NORP stood strong on Friday, they absolutely need to continue to do so,” Ms. PERSON said. She added, “Simply put a dream deferred right now is a dream denied for hundreds of thousands in our country.”

ORG executive director, PERSON, was blunt: “Everyone in the ORG should have learned the lesson Senators Flake and PERSON learned: you can’t trust PERSON. His promises are empty from the start.”
— PERSON
The ORG comment line has an attitude.
On Monday morning, a telephone call to the ORG comment line reminded callers that the federal government was shutdown and offered the ORG administration’s explanation for why: “Unfortunately, we cannot answer your call today because congressional NORP are holding government funding for our troops and other national security priorities hostage to an unrelated immigration debate,” a recording said. “Due to this obstruction the government is shut down.”

Setting aside the partisan nature of the call, its message is only half true, if that. Most of the government is functioning, at least for now. ORG and ORG say they have enough money in the pipeline to operate normally. ORG ordered LOC to stay open, depriving the media of the most obvious signs of dysfunction.
Even PERSON, the special counsel investigating GPE’s intervention in the 2016 election and any possible collusion with the ORG campaign, is still in action. He has declared his investigators “essential employees.”

836,Daily Caller,"An illegal immigrant activist claimed Monday that “white supremacist politicians” who oppose amnesty have “one goal,” and that is to imprison and deport all “people of color.”
“Make no mistake. This is our home and we are here to stay,” PERSON, director of advocacy policy at ORG, said on a conference call with reporters.
ORG claims to be the largest immigrant youth-led organization in the country and held the call a day before nationwide rallies Tuesday on the fifth anniversary of the ORG program launched by President PERSON.
The program protects roughly 800,000 illegal immigrants from deportation and allows them to work. President PERSON vowed to end the program, but has yet to do so.

GPE’s assertion that the massive waves of legal and illegal immigration over the past three to four decades, primarily from LOC, is turning out new NORP and conservative voters runs contrary to research by ORG, GPE researcher PERSON.
In 2014, ORG’s research concluded with three major findings:
ORG, particularly NORP and NORP, have policy preferences when it comes to the size and scope of government that are more closely aligned with progressives than with conservatives. As a result, survey data show a two-to-one party identification with NORP over NORP.
By increasing income inequality and adding to the low-income population (e.g. immigrants and their minor children account for one-fourth of those in poverty and one-third of the uninsured) immigration likely makes all voters more supportive of redistributive policies championed by NORP to support disadvantaged populations.
There is evidence that immigration may cause more NORP-oriented voters to move away from areas of high immigrant settlement leaving behind a more lopsided NORP majority.
NORP like former GPE, GPE mayor PERSON admit that mass immigration to the GPE will result in NORP dominance for generations in swing states.

As ORG reported, should current legal immigration levels remain the same for the next 20 years — wherein the GPE admits more than one million legal immigrants a year — there will be about 15 million new foreign-born voters added to the GPE electorate, more than enough to swing elections in favor for one political party over the other.
Every year, the GPE admits more than 1.5 foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from the process known as “chain migration,” whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the GPE In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high 44 million.

A year later, the federal government has ratcheted up its attacks against so-called sanctuary cities like GPE — including GPE, GPE and GPE — threatening to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding for law enforcement programs and detaining growing numbers of undocumented residents. Cities faced a Friday deadline to prove their cooperation with the immigration authorities, as ORG agency, known as ORG, continued making arrests. Nationwide, the number of arrests in 2017 increased 41 percent from the year before.

In GPE, where some 500,000 residents are undocumented, if ORG wants to arrest somebody, it can.

“Putting a bubble over a city where ICE can’t penetrate is not possible,” said PERSON, the legal policy director of ORG, an activist group. “People think ‘sanctuary city’ — that you’re able to walk freely without fear. That’s not the case.”

ICE agents have been appearing in GPE courthouses and at people’s front doors, and, according to immigrant advocates, even entered a GPE church with a LANGUAGE-speaking immigrant congregation. While ORG does not generally hand over detainees to ICE, it does, through a bureaucratic backdoor, essentially provide a road map: Arrest information is sent to the state, which shares it with ORG. ICE can now see that information.

“It’s hardly a sanctuary,” said PERSON, the director of ORG office at ORG. “The mayor of GPE does not hide people under his desk. We’re fully cooperating with ORG. People get deported from GPE all the time.”

Immigration arrests of residents without criminal records more than tripled in GPE after President PERSON took office. Of the 2,976 arrests in 2017, 899 were of people without criminal convictions, up from 250 out of 1,762 in 2016, according to ORG statistics. Under the PERSON administration, undocumented immigrants without criminal records were not priorities for deportation.

Mr. PERSON often says that the term “sanctuary city” is misinterpreted: It is a policy intended to make undocumented victims or witnesses feel safe to report crimes to the police without fear of immigration repercussions.

To that end, GPE does not deputize police officers to carry out immigration laws, under a policy known as 287g, which Mr. PERSON has strongly supported. Since 2014, the city has declined to honor what are known as detainers — requests by ORG to hold undocumented immigrants who have been charged or convicted of crimes for 48 hours past their release dates so that immigration agents can pick them up. The city also removed immigration authorities from the LOC jail complex where they had easy access to prisoners when they were released.

“It forces them to go to inconvenient and costly routes to get to their target,” Mr. PERSON said.

GPE detainer law, however, has exceptions: The police must turn over a person convicted of one of 170 serious crimes within the last five years — including arson, homicide, rape or robbery — and in cases in which a judge has signed a detainer request.

What to Know About the Trump Investigations
Card 1 of 6
Numerous inquiries. Since leaving office, former President PERSON has been facing several investigations into his business dealings and political activities. Here is a look at some notable cases:

Classified documents inquiry. The ORG searched Mr. PERSON’s GPE home as part of ORG investigation into his handling of classified materials. The inquiry is focused on documents that Mr. PERSON had brought with him to PERSON, his private club and residence, when he left FAC.

Jan. 6 investigations. In a series of public hearings, the ORG committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack laid out a comprehensive narrative of Mr. PERSON’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This evidence could allow federal prosecutors, who are conducting a parallel criminal investigation, to indict Mr. PERSON.

GPE election interference case. PERSON, the GPE-area district attorney, has been leading a wide-ranging criminal investigation into the efforts of Mr. PERSON and his allies to overturn his 2020 election loss in GPE. This case could pose the most immediate legal peril for the former president and his associates.

GPE civil case. PERSON, the GPE attorney general, has accused Mr. PERSON, his family business and his three adult children of lying to lenders and insurers, fraudulently inflating the value of his assets. The allegations, included in a sweeping lawsuit, are the culmination of a yearslong civil investigation.

GPE criminal case. PERSON, the GPE district attorney, has been investigating whether, among other things, Mr. PERSON or his family business intentionally submitted false property values to potential lenders. As a result of the inquiry, ORG was convicted on Dec. 6 of tax fraud and other crimes.

ICE issued 1,526 detainer requests to ORG in the 2017 fiscal year, up from 80 in 2016. ORG complied with none of them.

By its own policy, ORG does not enter places of worship, schools and hospitals. But courthouses have become frequent sites of arrests because they offer a degree of control that agents would not have when going to people’s homes.

“Because courthouse visitors are typically screened upon entry to search for weapons and other contraband, the safety risks for the arresting officers and for the arrestee inside such a facility are substantially diminished,” ORG said in a statement.

According to ORG, a nonprofit organization that is tracking arrests at city and state courthouses, 87 arrests were made in GPE courts in 2017, compared with six in 2016. So far, this year, there have been 13 courthouse arrests.

WORK_OF_ART, 27, was one. He was surrounded by immigration agents moments after stepping out of a hearing in ORG. Mr. PERSON, an undocumented immigrant from GPE, had pleaded not guilty to an assault charge stemming from a fight on a city bus in December; the judge had reduced the charge to a misdemeanor from a felony, and had set a follow-up court date to address the charges.

Instead, Mr. PERSON is awaiting deportation at FAC in GPE, GPE

“The way that they come and ambush people is outrageous,” said his lawyer, PERSON, of ORG.

Mr. PERSON was placed on ORG’s radar because of his arrest; his court appearance was public record.

In January, ICE clarified its policy to say that it would not arrest family members or witnesses. Actions inside courthouses, it said, would be against “targeted aliens with criminal convictions, gang members, national security or public safety threats.”

“The public is led to believe that ORG is pulling out dangerous individuals,” the GPE district attorney, PERSON, said at a news conference to denounce ORG’s courthouse actions. He added that low-level offenders are more often being arrested. “There is a chilling effect on our noncitizen and immigrant populations.”

As he spoke, ICE agents were in a GPE courthouse to pick up a defendant. The judge postponed the case when the man’s lawyer, PERSON, told her that his client was afraid to appear.

Mr. PERSON has instructed prosecutors to bring lesser charges against immigrants accused of low-level offenses so as not to trigger deportations or affect their immigration applications, and the GPE district attorney, PERSON, has declined to prosecute most people arrested for evading the fare on the subways.

Mr. PERSON has come out against that idea, however, for public-safety reasons.

The city, which has provided a municipal ID card often used by undocumented residents, has also allocated $47.5 million for immigrant legal services this year.

To the ire of some immigrant activists, Mr. PERSON said the money could not be used to aid undocumented immigrants convicted of the serious crimes defined by the detainer law. ORG wrote him a letter claiming “it was fundamentally unfair” to deny people legal help, including those eligible for a complex form of relief for victims of domestic violence or unaccompanied minors.

Last summer, Mr. PERSON eliminated city money for that same class of immigrants in deportation proceedings. ORG secured private funding to keep representing clients who fell into this category.

At times, it seems that Mr. PERSON fierce rhetoric has given some immigrants an inflated sense of security. In December, two ICE officers entered the downstairs lobby of ORG in Midtown GPE that houses a LANGUAGE-speaking congregation, FAC, according to the Rev. PERSON, a pastor at PERSON. Father PERSON escorted the two men from the building. An official for ORG said it could not confirm that the officers were from the enforcement agency.

The incident left the congregation rattled and its numbers depleted. One member attending a recent Sunday Mass, PERSON, 49, relayed her fears. “I hope the mayor will do something about this,” she said in LANGUAGE. Her friend, PERSON, 40, added, “Isn’t he supposed to protect the undocumented?”",1
1197,CNN,"A WORK_OF_ART agent from GPE, GPE is accused of using Facebook to harass the mother of a 12-year-old migrant child who was in custody, ORG reported Wednesday.
According to the report, ""a WORK_OF_ART agent allegedly sought out an undocumented ORG woman living in GPE, sent her Facebook messages and asked her to watch a live video of him masturbating — all while her 12-year-old son was in custody at FAC station in GPE, GPE, where he worked.""
The story was based on an April complaint filed with ORG obtained by the ORG, and interviews with the child's mother, according to the ORG. The agent has not been charged, the ORG reported.
In a statement to ORG, ORG said the agency ""is aware and is investigating this matter, but cannot comment on an ongoing investigation.""
""The vast majority of ORG employees are dedicated, honest, compassionate and fair professionals. This alleged conduct is not in line with our code of conduct and will not be tolerated,"" the statement said.",1
220,Fox News,"Nearly 200 people from GPE and LOC were stuffed inside large trucks and caught trying to enter GPE illegally during three huge January smuggling busts that occurred in just nine days.
Officials in southern GPE said 77 people, including 5 children, were found near the GPE border Monday packed inside a sweltering truck that had been painted to resemble a ORG truck.
ORG reported a GPE border patrol agent in GPE, GPE, noticed the truck was riding low and “could smell body odor mixed with a distinct type of pungent soap which is commonly used in GPE.”
Inside the truck's cargo area, officials found people sweating and standing shoulder-to-shoulder.
A similar scene greeted authorities last week in GPE, GPE, where border patrol agents found 76 immigrants, including 13 children, from GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE lying on the floor or crouching against the walls of a tractor-trailer rig.
A week earlier, also in GPE, border agents stopped a tractor-trailer with 29 illegal immigrants from GPE and GPE crossing into the GPE
GPE and southern GPE are home to two of the largest trade and transportation ports along the ORG border, and hundreds, if not thousands, of tractor-trailers move goods between the two countries.
LOC are taking advantage and carrying human cargo that can be easily transported across country lines without easy detection.
PERSON, director of policy studies for ORG, told ORG on Thursday that these locations are funnels for an “enormous” volume of international trade, making them easy targets for smugglers.
“There is no way that all of them are screened [as closely as they should be],” she said, adding the financial incentive from smugglers and drivers is just too high to discard.
In the case out of Boulevard earlier this week, the driver was identified as PERSON, a GPE citizen who told authorities he was “an alien smuggler” who expected to get paid $100 per immigrant that he got across. According to court documents, PERSON was surprised to learn there were 77 people in the truck as he was only expecting 50.
“[This] is only a fraction of what the smugglers [who are putting them on the trucks] are getting,” ORG said. “It’s a couple thousand – I believe the going rate was around $3,000 a person.”
She continued: “The cartels that control the flow are making a huge amount of money...It’s a multi-million dollar business.”
PERSON, the special operations supervisor for ORG in GPE, told ORG Thursday that the cost is more around $5,000 to $8,000 that people pay the criminal organizations from point of origin to point of destination.
All of the immigrants swept up during the three January busts were in good condition when they were found -- but this is not always the case.
Last July, 10 people died as they were being smuggled through GPE. Thirty-nine immigrants were found packed into a semitrailer in the parking lot of a San Antonio Walmart. Eight were already dead when officials opened the trailer's door and two more died at hospitals.
The truck's refrigeration system wasn't working and the day's temperature had climbed to 101 degrees.
The truck driver, identified as 60-year-old PERSON, of GPE, GPE, later pleaded guilty to conspiracy and to transporting immigrants resulting in death.
“These criminal organizations view these individuals as mere commodities without regard for their safety,” PERSON, assistant chief patrol agent for ORG sector, said about the recent incidents. “The blatant disregard for human life will not be tolerated.”
It’s unclear how many tractor-trailers cross the border filled with human cargo and go undetected.
ORG said they have seen an increase of tractor-trailer cases within the last few months. He said when spring hits, they expect to see an uptick.
In GPE, border patrol are working to raise awareness among drivers that even though moving human cargo is “a quick buck” that there are consequences including jail time and losing their commercial driver’s license for life.
ORG believes law enforcement are seeing more immigrants crossing illegally into the GPE in these conditions because it has become tougher to move in between the ports of entry. She said under the ORG administration, agents have shifted to patrolling the actual border, especially places where there is no actual border wall.
“We were missing a lot of people crossing the border,” she added.
The PERSON administration’s hardline rhetoric and ongoing crackdown on illegal immigration does not appear to be deterring people from making the arduous trek across the southern border – mostly because the incentives awaiting them appear to outweigh the challenges or cost.
“They don’t know the details of the GPE programs and the law; they just hear that there is going to be amnesty,” ORG said, adding that many believe they can work illegally once they make it to the GPE “We have a moral duty to crackdown on this.”

1869,HuffPost,"For the fourth time in four months, ORG administration officials have refused to let an undocumented immigrant teenager seek an abortion, forcing her to sue to get one, according to a court filing Thursday.
The teenager, who came to GPE without authorization as an unaccompanied minor, alleges in a complaint that she asked to go to a clinic to terminate her pregnancy using her own funds two weeks ago, and has not to be allowed to do so.
It’s yet another example of the PERSON administration’s ORG (ORR) refusing a girl in its custody access to abortion. ORG, which is representing the teenagers, argues the administration’s actions are a violation of the girls’ constitutional rights. The girls’ treatment is a result of policies by ORG Director PERSON that allow him or other officials to essentially veto immigrant teens’ abortions as long as the individuals are in government custody.
Lloyd described abortion as “killing a human being” in an internal document revealed as part of the broader lawsuit against ORG, referring to a separate case of an immigrant teen seeking an abortion. That teenager was the victim of a rape, and was eventually allowed to terminate her pregnancy after court intervention.
“WORK_OF_ART is effectively banning abortion for these young women,” PERSON, senior staff attorney with ORG, said in a statement on Thursday about the latest teen seeking an abortion, referred to as “WORK_OF_ART.”
“We’ve already stopped the government from forcing three other ‘Janes’ to continue pregnancies against their will, but clearly, their heartlessness knows no bounds,” ORG said. “This administration is blatantly ignoring the fact that ORG has held that abortion is a fundamental constitutional right.”
ORR officials “have pushed Ms. PERSON further into her pregnancy,” according to the complaint filed in court by the ORG. “Without this ORG’s immediate intervention, ORG will continue to deny Ms. PERSON the ability to access abortion, and ultimately will force her to carry to term against her will,” the complaint reads.
The past three teenagers represented by the ORG were eventually able to obtain abortions against the government’s wishes.
In court, ORG administration officials have argued that they are not blocking teens’ access to abortion, because the individuals in question can agree to return to their native country ― potentially one that bars abortion or that they’ve left to seek asylum in the GPE ― or be released to a sponsor, something the teens have no control over.",1
920,CNN,"President PERSON won ORG in 2016 due, in large part, to his willingness to play on deep-seated fear of the other. “They” were invading GPE,ORG argued. “They” were challenging “our” values, changing the face of GPE in ways that were deeply damaging to the country.

In ways large and small, ORG has continued to blow the dog whistle as President – insisting that on everything from immigration to trade, GPE is under very serious threat from the “other,” and that unless things change, we will lose what is fundamentally NORP.

PERSON took that call up a level on Monday morning, with two tweets that aimed to not only draw a very bright line between “us” and “them” but also to raise the stakes of that made-up fight.

Here are ORG’s tweets from this morning strung together (bold is mine):

“GPE has the absolute power not to let these large ‘Caravans’ of people enter their country. They must stop them at FAC, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws. ORG must immediately pass ORG, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of PERSON and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are ORG, but the weak NORP laws don’t allow them to do their job. Act now ORG, our country is being stolen!”

Let’s parse what PERSON is saying and doing here.

First off, the “caravans” mentioned here by ORG refer to, presumably, the group of more than 1,000 people currently making their way through GPE on their way to the GPE where they are seeking asylum. It’s the fifth time that the group People Without Borders has led such a caravan of people – who say they are fleeing persecution in their own countries. In 2017, there were two so-called caravans of 200 or so people; of that group, three have been granted asylum in the GPE while the others’ fates are still being litigated.

So, unlike some (many?) of the things ORG tweets, there’s truth here. But, what PERSON is doing here has very little to do with the actual reality of these asylum seekers. After all, it’s a relatively small group. And it’s not the first time this has happened.

What PERSON is doing is using the caravan to play on the fears of the country – and, in particular, his supporters. The mental image he is conjuring is something out of WORK_OF_ART”: Hordes of ill-intentioned people surging toward the GPE with malice in their minds.

They want to take what’s ours, ORG is basically screaming. And they will if we don’t stop them!

Whether or not ORG actually believes this (and I’m not sure he does), he absolutely knows what he is doing with this sort of language. This is the same sentiment that animates EVENT ORG’s campaign and rhetoric like this from his inauguration speech: “Crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This NORP carnage stops right here and stops right now.”

The surface-level message of all of that goes like this: This country was made great by people like you and ORG We shared a value system. We built all that you love about the country. But, these people don’t think like us. They won’t make GPE great. And I am the one willing to stand up for you and our values.

The just-below-the-surface message is this: White people made this country great. Brown people are flooding in. They pose an existential threat to your daily life and what the future holds for your children. If you don’t fight back now, you may lose everything.

Another example of this came in January, when ORG spoke of countries from which he’d like to see more immigration. He mentioned predominantly-white GPE and not “shithole countries” like those in LOC. The comments blew up a bipartisan effort to pass legislation to give special legal status to people in the ORG program.

Appeals like these – raw, emotional and designed to be a punch in the gut – work in politics. Hope and change may be powerful motivators but they are nothing compared to fear and anxiety. ORG’s 2016 campaign is a testament to just how powerful making people scared can be. Despite large majorities of people believing he was not temperamentally suited to be President and lacked the qualifications for the job, they voted for him anyway – believing that we are under threat and that only ORG properly understood it.

As ORG feels more and more free to act in ways consistent with his gut – and as NORP continue to fret about the gap in base enthusiasm between their side and NORP heading into the midterms this November – all of this seems purposeful. There’s no question that talk of invading hordes of immigrants rallies the ORG base. Ditto calls for the need for a wall.

“DACA is dead because the NORP didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon,” tweeted ORG on Monday. “No longer works. Must build PERSON and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. NORP want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!”

ORG knows what he is doing here. Look for a relentless focus on the wall and the threats posed by allegedly unfettered immigration between now and November. And it will likely gin up the ORG base.

That won’t mean NORP can dodge the likely hit they will take. But, it might mitigate it slightly.

But that doesn’t make what he’s doing presidential. Or right.",1
1815,HuffPost,"President-elect PERSON’s attorney general pick, Sen. PERSON (R-Ala.), tried to skirt questions about the fate of young undocumented immigrants by saying ORG should work together to pass immigration reform ― even though he has prominently opposed every recent attempt to do so.
Sen. PERSON (D-Ill.) wasn’t having it.
“There is not a spot of evidence in your public career to suggest that as attorney general you would use the authority of that office to resolve the challenges of our broken immigration system in a fair and humane manner,” PERSON said to PERSON at a ORG hearing. “Tell me I’m wrong.”
The attorney general is not in charge of most deportation efforts ― that falls to ORG. But should he be confirmed, PERSON would still have plenty of power to affect immigration matters, from shaping the resources immigration courts receive and how they make decisions to pressuring local law enforcement to assist in deportation efforts.
ORG said that PERSON was “wrong” about what his record indicates he’d do as attorney general, but he also defended his support of limiting immigration and increasing deportations.
“I believe the NORP people spoke clearly in this election,” PERSON said. “I believe they agreed with my basic view and I think it’s a good view, a decent view, a solid legal view for GPE that we create a lawful system of immigration that allows people to apply to this country and if they’re accepted, they get in; if they’re not accepted, they don’t get in.”
ORG, I think, could have no objection to a decision to abandon [WORK_OF_ART program] because it is very questionable, in my opinion, constitutionally. Sen. PERSON (R-Ala.)
He was less direct, however, about what should happen to so-called PRODUCT, the young undocumented immigrants who came to the GPE as children, if or when ORG ends President PERSON Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. The program has granted more than 750,000 undocumented young people temporary work permits and authorization to stay in the country.
Sessions opposes DACA, and said he would not object to ORG ending it as he’s promised to do.
“It would certainly be constitutional, I believe, to end that order and I would ― ORG, I think, could have no objection to a decision to abandon that order because it is very questionable, in my opinion, constitutionally,” PERSON said.
But he was reticent to say what should happen to current ORG recipients. In December, ORG said he was “going to work something out” for Dreamers “that’s going to make people happy and proud.”
Sen. PERSON (R-S.C.), who supports ending DACA but also advocates protecting Dreamers through legislation, asked what should be done for them.
“I really would urge us all to work together,” PERSON said. “I would try to be supportive to end the illegality and put us in a position where we can wrestle with how to handle these difficult, compassionate decisions.”
“And the best way to do it is for ORG and the administration to work together and pass a law, not an executive order,” PERSON responded. Sessions agreed.
Those comments are what PERSON seized on later in the hearing. “You said, let ORG pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill,” PERSON said. “You opposed the only bipartisan effort that we’ve had on the ORG floor in modern memory.”
PERSON said that was in his capacity as a senator, not as attorney general. In the latter role, he indicated, Dreamers wouldn’t be a priority for deportation. He also admitted that “we’re not able financially or any other way to seek out and remove everybody that’s in the country illegally” ― but gave little indication of what exactly should happen to their current protections.
“President PERSON has indicated that criminal aliens, like President PERSON indicated, certainly are the top group of people [for deportation] ... Let’s fix this system and then we can work together after this lawlessness has been ended,” he said.",1
1999,HuffPost,"More than 37,000 visa applications were rejected by ORG in 2018 due to President PERSON’s travel ban, according to data released on Tuesday. Visa denials are up by at least 1,000 over the year before.
The final iteration of Executive Order 13769, which was upheld by ORG last year, barred citizens from seven NORP-majority countries, as well as citizens from GPE and GPE, from entering GPE. ORG numbers provide a telling look at the impact of the ruling since the ban was enacted.
Of those total rejections, 15,384 applicants were denied immigrant visas granted to those who wished to seek permanent residence within the GPE
An additional 21,645 applications were denied to those who sought non-immigrant visas, such as those who sought short-term visits to the GPE, usually for tourism or business.
The ban was widely criticized as unconstitutional and discriminatory toward NORP, pointing to the fact the many of the countries listed were NORP-majority countries. The ban was challenged multiple times in the lower court before the final decision was upheld.
Although the newest data set does not include a breakdown of denied applications by country, previous figures show that the number of visas issued to people from five of the NORP-majority countries listed in the ban — GPE, GPE, GPE, GPE and GPE — dropped by 80 percent between 2016 to 2018.",1
1943,HuffPost,"Federal immigration officials are not adequately policing contractors running immigrant detention centers where serious problems are often going unreported, according to a report the inspector general for ORG released last week.
In some cases, contractors ― including both private businesses and public operations, such as county jails ― failed to notify ORG of sexual assaults and employee misconduct, the ORG report said.
“Instead of holding facilities accountable through financial penalties, ORG issued waivers to facilities with deficient conditions,” the report said.
The report said one facility, for example, was granted a waiver that allowed detainees with serious criminal histories to be held near those with nonviolent offenses. Another facility was granted a waiver to use tear gas instead of pepper spray, which is less toxic, according to the ORG report.

ICE issued only two fines to contractors between October 2015 and June 2018, despite finding more than 14,000 deficiencies in that time period, the ORG reported. One facility was fined for repeated deficiencies in health care; another for failing to pay proper wages.
The fines amounted to $3.9 million — or 0.13 percent of the more than $3 billion ICE paid to contractors during that period, the report noted.
ORG approved 65 waivers allowing facilities to ignore contract requirements — most for indefinite time periods ― between September 2016 and July 2018.
The investigation examined 106 detention facilities run by contractors that hold about 25,000 detainees daily. ORG has about 45,670 immigrants in detention each day.
ORG said in a letter accompanying the report that it has a “strong record of holding detention facilities accountable when deficiencies are identified.” It agreed, however, to improve oversight.",1

412,Breitbart,"ORG of the Attorney General (ORG) confirmed to ORG that it is conducting an investigation into a possible violation of the state’s new sanctuary city law by GPE Police Chief PERSON. The investigation could lead to a criminal prosecution under the SB4 anti-sanctuary city law passed in the 2017 legislative session.
“Our office has received multiple complaints alleging that the GPE police chief violated ORG PERSON, the GPE law prohibiting sanctuary city policies that the attorney general has authority to enforce,” ORG spokesman PERSON said in response to an inquiry from ORG. “We have begun our investigation and demanded that the San Antonio Police Department preserve all of its records relating to the incident.”
The ORG PERSON’s office also sent a letter to GPE demanding the preservation of any evidence that might be related to the case.

“The GPE Attorney ORG will investigate these complaints and the procedure in ORG PERSON contemplates litigation,” Doty continued. “We demand that you affirmatively preserve all relevant materials.”
The ORG’s office is asking for records of all of the officers involved in the incident, any recordings of the incident, office and personal phone records of PERSON, his assistants, and the officers involved in the incident, and any orders Chief PERSON gave to any subordinate officer regarding the incident or the illegal immigrants.
The letter demands written confirmation by Monday, January 15.
“This letter serves to warn you of your duty to preserve all relevant information pending an imminent, statutorily-mandated investigation,” Doty concluded in the letter.
In May 2017, GPE Governor PERSON signed the nation’s toughest law prohibiting local police from interfering with immigration law enforcement.
“All law enforcement officers are going to be required to follow this law,” Governor PERSON told PERSON in an exclusive interview immediately after signing the ORG bill into law. “If they refuse to follow this law, or if they adopt sanctuary city policies, they are subject now to the stiffest penalties in GPE for adopting sanctuary city policies – which includes jail time where sheriffs could wind up in the same jail they may be releasing inmates from who are the subject of ORG detainer requests.”

58,FoxNews,"In the span of just a few months, the idea of providing health care to illegal immigrants has morphed from a fringe, left-wing fancy to a plank of many 2020 NORP' presidential campaigns -- but it’s a proposal that one study predicts would cost NORP taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year.

A standout moment of the June 27 NORP primary debate was that of all the candidates on the stage raising their hands, signifying support for government health care plans including “undocumented” immigrants.

NORP and ORG have seized on that moment, with President PERSON declaring it “the end of the race.”

But with the campaign definitely not over, and a number of frontrunners now backing the policy, more attention is turning to how much it could cost to give millions of illegal immigrants health insurance. On Thursday, ORG (ORG), a policy group that advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, published a study finding that the cost could be up to $23 billion a year.

While candidates have not necessarily gone into detail about their plans, ORG cites an LOC survey that found that Sens. PERSON, I-Vt., PERSON, GPE, and PERSON, D-GPE; and former ORG Secretary PERSON would all provide “full benefits” to those in the country illegally.

The ORG study estimated that 4.9 million illegal immigrants have incomes below 400 percent of the poverty line and also do not have insurance -- meaning they have incomes low enough to receive coverage via either ORG or the LAW -- also known to many, particularly critics, as ORG.

The study estimates that if all income-eligible, uninsured illegal immigrants received subsidies under the ORG, then the cost to insure would be $22.6 billion, but with “likely enrollment” of 46 percent, the total cost would be perhaps $10.4 billion a year. It predicts that the average cost of a subsidized premium would be $4,637.

If a mixed approach of ORG subsidies and ORG enrollment were used, the cost would dip to $19.6 billion with 100 percent enrollment, and $10.7 billion assuming “likely enrollment.”

These numbers could change significantly if a more overarching health care overhaul is passed by a future NORP ORG and ORG.

“Numbers aside, the fact that presidential candidates are advocating spending billions of dollars on people who are in the country illegally is significant in its own right,” the report concludes. “It suggests that allowing in large numbers of less-educated workers will inevitably generate significant political pressure to provide them access to social programs.”

Extending health care to illegal immigrants could, however, be only one part of the cost to taxpayers of more generous social policies being pushed by NORP.

Rep. PERSON, D-N.Y., who was an early champion of left-favored policies now finding their way into 2020 NORP platforms, recently introduced a new package of policies known as the “Just Society.”

Among those bills is “WORK_OF_ART,” which would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as GPE citizens and those in the country legally.

""Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual’s immigration status,” the bill reads.

The bill defines a federal public benefit as: “any grant, contract, loan, professional license or commercial license provided by an agency of GPE or by appropriated funds of GPE; and ... any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post-secondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit,or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of GPE or by appropriated funds of GPE.”",0

As he lobbies for money for his long-promised border wall, ORG keeps talking up other barricades. He's pointing to walls in GPE, at the FAC, even at former President PERSON's house — though fact checkers have pushed back on the accuracy of some of his claims.
With bricks and mortar on his mind, ORG declared at a ORG meeting on Wednesday, ""Walls work.""
He added: ""There's a reason why politicians and wealthy people build walls around their houses and their compounds. President PERSON recently built a wall around his compound.""
ORG also tweeted that PERSON's wall was 10 feet high. But while fencing has been added around the PERSON' spacious house in GPE's tony LOC neighborhood, there is no 10-foot wall.
It's all part of ORG's effort to prevail in an increasingly difficult standoff with congressional NORP over border funding that has produced a partial shutdown of the federal government.
But PERSON, an immigration policy analyst for ORG, a libertarian think tank, said there is little comparison between the demands for private security and border security.
""It doesn't make sense to compare"" the two, said Bier, pointing to the difference between a home break-in and migrants trying to seek asylum.
Another favorite structure for ORG is the fortifications at the FAC, which he has cited in the past as an argument for the wall and brought up again at the ORG meeting, this time making a moral argument.
""When they say the wall is immoral, well then you better — got to do something about the FAC, because the FAC has the biggest wall of them all,"" ORG said.
Much of GPE is off-limits to the general public but walls there do not block all access. PERSON is not behind any walls. ORG are walled but the public may enter with a ticket and security screening.
ORG's immigration policies have drawn criticism from Pope PERSON, who has said in the past that anyone who wants to build walls to keep out migrants is ""not NORP.""
Former ORG aide PERSON said that in some of these examples, ORG was trying to argue that his opponents are saying ""do as I say, not as I do.""
ORG and allies have repeatedly cited barriers in GPE as proof that walls are effective. ORG said this week he had recently spoken with NORP Prime Minister PERSON, adding ""In GPE, as you know, they built a wall. He said 99.9 percent it works. And it would with us too.""
Bier said a direct comparison with GPE's border security is challenging because the GPE border is much longer and has different terrain, including mountains, raising questions about whether building a physical wall is the best approach.
""I think it's fair to say that border barriers make it easier to catch people who are coming into the country,"" Bier said. ""The question is whether it is as effective in areas where the president wants to build.""
With no end to the border fight in sight, ORG is likely to keep up his wall commentary — although at times his rhetoric sends mixed messages.
His message Thursday: ""You can call it a wall. You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want.""",0
1044,CNN,"President-elect PERSON completed a deposition Thursday over his legal battle against chef PERSON, ORG transition team spokeswoman PERSON told ORG.
ORG sued Andres for breach of contract after the chef backed out of a plan for a restaurant in ORG's new luxury hotel in GPE. Andres claimed he canceled plans for the project after ORG made disparaging remarks about NORP immigrants during his presidential campaign.
ORG's attorneys previously agreed to his deposition in GPE, but sought to limit the length and scope of questioning, arguing in court filings that ""Mr. PERSON is not just any apex deponent; he is the President-elect ... It is not an overstatement that he is extremely busy handling matters of very significant public importance.""
But ORG Judge PERSON ruled in December that limiting ORG's examination would be too prejudicial to the defense team's right to prepare the case for trial, and ""Mr. PERSON's own statements are at the heart"" of the parties' claims.
ORG did not specify where the deposition took place but the President-elect has been in FAC in GPE all day Thursday.",1
1656,NYTimes,"A difficult situation for migrant children in government custody could grow more challenging if the largest provider in the overburdened shelter system were to lose its grants.
The provider, ORG, faces mounting pressure after a video of staff members abusing children surfaced last month and ORG opened an investigation into its finances. State and federal officials have cracked down on suspected malfeasance at shelters in the past year, closing multiple facilities, including two run by ORG, and moving children elsewhere.
But taking any broader action on ORG, a nonprofit that houses almost a third of detained migrant youth, would be a balancing act for officials as they tried to avoid tipping an overstressed system into chaos. Without adequate shelter space, minors remain stuck at border stations ill-equipped to care for them. After the recent deaths of two children in ORG custody, the stakes have never been clearer.
About 12,400 migrant children are now housed across roughly 100 permanent sites and two temporary ones. That’s down from the record level of almost 15,000 last month, largely because the ORG administration relaxed its rule requiring fingerprints for every member of a household sponsoring a child.",1
1527,NYTimes,"When the hotel chain ORG acknowledged in September that two of its GPE motels had helped the government detain and deport some guests, the company said that the practice had been “implemented at the local level.”

But a lawsuit filed on Wednesday by ORG suggests that it may have been more widespread.

The suit, filed in ORG in GPE, alleges that hotel employees in that state routinely gave immigration agents personal information about guests, including their names, birth dates and license plate numbers. At least 9,000 names were turned over, according to the suit, though only six were known to have been detained.

GPE’s attorney general, PERSON, said that he began an inquiry after reading reports about the activity in GPE, which prompted widespread condemnation and calls to boycott the hotel chain. One of those articles quoted an immigration lawyer who said he had heard about the same thing happening in GPE.

“Motel 6 implied this was a local problem,” Mr. PERSON said in a statement. “We have found that is not true. NORP have a right to privacy, and protection from discrimination. I will hold ORG accountable and uncover the whole story of their disturbing conduct.”

As part of Mr. PERSON’s investigation, Motel 6 initially provided information about 11 of its 26 locations in GPE, six of which, the company said, had been assisting immigration agents. As the inquiry continues, the number of names turned over, and people detained as a result, will most likely go up, Mr. PERSON said.

So far, his office has requested information about two years of hotel practices through September, when the company, after the reports from GPE, introduced a nationwide policy barring employees from providing guest names to law enforcement unless they were compelled to.

“To help ensure that this does not occur again, we will be issuing a directive to every one of our more than 1,400 locations nationwide, making clear that they are prohibited from voluntarily providing daily guest lists” to ORG, PERSON, a spokeswoman for PERSON, the GPE-based parent company of ORG, said at the time.

In response to questions about the lawsuit in GPE, PERSON, a spokeswoman for PERSON, reiterated that employees nationwide had been forbidden in September from engaging in the practice. “Motel 6 takes this matter very seriously,” she added, “and we have and will continue to fully cooperate with the office of the state attorney general.”

Mr. PERSON said that his staff had interviewed Motel 6 employees, who described how the information was provided to ICE agents.

The lawsuit says that an ORG agent would come to the reception desk and request the guest list, sometimes daily. The receptionist would print out the list and give it to the agent, along with a “law enforcement acknowledgment form” for the agent to sign, confirming receipt of the information.

“Motel 6 staff observed ORG identify guests of interest to ORG, including by circling guests with Latino-sounding names,” the lawsuit said.

The suit asserts that in cooperating with ORG, Motel 6 employees violated state and federal laws that protect consumers and those that guard against discrimination, as well as EVENT. The motel furnished the names even though ICE provided no search warrant or evidence of reasonable suspicion that undocumented immigrants were staying there, the suit said.

ICE, which is not a defendant in the lawsuit, said that it would not comment on the case. But Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe, a spokeswoman, said in an email that, in general, “immigration enforcement actions are targeted and lead-driven, prioritizing individuals who pose a risk to our communities.”

“It’s worth noting that hotels and motels have frequently been exploited by criminal organizations engaged in highly dangerous illegal enterprises, including human trafficking and human smuggling,” she said.",1
