1270,"The Trump administration is preparing for nearly 180,000 migrants traveling as families to cross the southern border of the U.S. by May, continuing an already record-breaking year. According to an internal document reviewed by OutletName, officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection anticipate between 51,000 and 58,000 migrants traveling as families will either cross the border illegally or ask for asylum at a legal border crossing this month. The agency projects that figure will reach as many as 70,000 in May, based on historical trends. Arrests of families crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally in the past five months hit a record of 136,150. The tally eclipsed a record of 107,212 families arrested during the entire 2018 fiscal year. Separately, 21,968 immigrant families asked for asylum at legal border crossings between October and February. The volume of families at those crossings was about the same a year ago. The flood of families crossing the U.S. border with Mexico represents a “border security and humanitarian crisis” and has left Customs and Border Protection at “the breaking point,” Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said last week. Customs and Border Protection declined to comment on the document, which is labeled “planning profile.” Despite recent increases, the total number of arrests at the border has been hovering near lows not seen since the 1970s, primarily due to a long-term decline in single adults, who have been deterred by stepped-up enforcement and an improved Mexican economy. Most of the families so far this year are from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, where they say they face violence, political instability and widespread poverty and hunger. The majority of families surrender to border agents and ask for asylum after crossing into the U.S. illegally. Fewer than 20% of all asylum applications are ultimately granted, but people with children are generally allowed to stay in the U.S. while their requests are adjourned, which typically takes years due to a backlog of more than 829,000 cases in immigration court. The Trump administration has repeatedly tried to make changes to immigration laws and procedures to slow the flood of families, including a policy that led to separating families. A federal judge in San Diego ordered the administration to reunite more than 2,500 separated children last year, a process that is ongoing. That same judge on Friday ruled that a class-action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union should include families separated before last year’s short-lived zero-tolerance policy, but didn’t yet order the government to locate those families. The ACLU sued the government last year on behalf of an African woman separated from her child at a border crossing and the case was later expanded to a class-action suit. President Trump has cited the increasing volume of families as evidence of a national emergency at the border. He has repeatedly said current immigration laws and what he describes as flawed court rulings encourage illegal immigration because families, most of whom ask for asylum, cannot be detained for more than about 20 days. If the more conservative of two projections on the Customs and Border Protection document is accurate, about 178,000 people traveling as families will come into the U.S. illegally, or legally to request asylum, between March and May, compared with fewer than 46,000 during the same period last year.",0
2349,"A 45-year-old undocumented immigrant from Mexico died in Border Patrol custody Monday after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border into Texas, marking the third person to die in the agency's custody since December.
The immigrant illegally crossed the border and was arrested by the Roma (Texas) Police Department on Feb. 2, requested medical attention and was taken to a local hospital, according to a statement released Monday night by Customs and Border Protection. The immigrant ""was cleared"" by officials at the Mission Regional Medical Center and was handed over to Border Patrol officials at the Rio Grande City Border Patrol Station, according to the CBP statement.
The following day, after receiving a welfare check by CBP officials, the immigrant again requested medical attention and was taken to the McAllen Medical Center, where the immigrant was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and congestive heart failure, CBP said. The immigrant remained at the hospital before dying on Monday morning.
The incident follows two cases in December when minor children from Guatemala, ages 8 and 7, died after crossing the U.S. border into New Mexico, drawing widespread condemnation of Border Patrol.
That prompted Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan to issue new guidelines requiring his agents to more quickly inform CBP leadership, Congress, and the public of the death of people in its custody. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen later followed up by ordering more robust medical screenings of children it holds in its custody.
Those deaths followed intense criticism of the agency's handling of children during the administration's now-rescinded ""zero-tolerance"" that led to more than 2,800 family separations along the border.
Customs and Border Protection spokesman Andrew Meehan said the official cause of death in Monday's case remains unknown, and that the immigrant's identity is not being released. Meehan said the department is following newly-created notification guidelines following deaths in its custody, and has alerted Congress and the Mexican government of the immigrant's death.
""This loss of life is tragic,"" Meehan said in a statement. ""Our condolences go out to the family and loved ones. CBP remains committed to ensuring the safe and humane treatment of those within the care of our custody.""
Border Patrol officials have said they cannot handle the influx of family units and unaccompanied minors who have flooded the southwest border in recent years, many of them requesting asylum in the U.S.
In the past four months, a monthly average of 24,975 members of family units and 5,031 unaccompanied minors have crossed the southern border, according to CBP data. The family unit average is far higher than the monthly average of 6,406 over the same period in 2018.
That surge has led the Trump administration to try and limit the number of people who can request asylum, actions that have been blocked by the federal courts. The surge also contributed to President Donald Trump's decision on Friday to declare a national emergency to expand the southern border wall, which will also lead to a flood of lawsuits.
The new Democratic-led House of Representatives has vowed to investigate housing conditions for migrants along the border. Part of the budget deal that averted a government shutdown last week included $415 million for humanitarian relief ""specifically for medical care"" and to improve Border Patrol processing facilities in the region.
CBP's summary of Monday's death did not indicate whether the immigrant was requesting asylum. It noted that the immigrant was caught by police in a second attempt to illegally enter the U.S.",0

Four thousand-plus migrant children say they were abused
Thousands of migrant children who crossed the southern border into the U.S. reported they were sexually assaulted while in government custody, according to Department of Health and Human Services documents released Tuesday. In the past four years, 4,556 children said they were sexually assaulted while in the care of Health & Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement, which takes custody of unaccompanied minors who cross the southern border alone and those separated from their families. The data show the majority of the alleged assaults were carried out by other minors in custody, but at least 178 were carried out by staff. The allegations go back to 2015.
House blocks Trump's emergency declaration. Now what?
The House voted to block President Donald Trump's declaration of a national emergency along the southern border on Tuesday, but Democrats didn’t win enough support from Republicans to overcome Trump’s threatened veto. The measure now goes to Senate. Trump declared an emergency this month after Congress sent the president a bipartisan funding bill that failed to meet his $5.7 billion demand for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats have said the declaration is unconstitutional and are using a provision from the National Emergencies Act to try to halt the president. If the resolution passes both houses, Trump could still veto it.
Kim Jong Un gave U.S. journalists the boot
One hotel's not big enough for American journalists and Kim Jong Un. Kim and his team pulled a fast one on the White House, forcing them to relocate the media's press filing center from the hotel where the North Korean leader is staying. Television crews that spent weeks setting up equipment and establishing camera positions scrambled in the hours ahead of Trump’s arrival to meet Kim at the nuclear summit meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam. The two world leaders, who've threatened each other with nuclear annihilation in the past, are set to convene Wednesday. Few details about their agenda have been released, but it’s a safe bet that much of the discussion will center on their denuclearization agreement.Real quick
Cohen's about to tell on Trump
Michael Cohen once said he'd “take a bullet” for Trump. Today, he met behind closed doors with a Senate committee planning to accuse the president of ‘criminal conduct,' according to a source familiar with the testimony. Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer and confidant, pleaded guilty to several charges including for paying hush money to women who said they slept with Trump and for lying to Congress about negotiations for a Trump Tower in Russia. The question looming over his testimony: Did the president participate in those crimes? Trump, of course, has said he was not involved. Cohen's also scheduled to testify for the first time publicly on Wednesday (and yes, it will be televised).
Michael Cohen departs after sentencing at the Moynahan Federal Courthouse in New York on Dec. 12, 2018. She says Trump kissed without consent. Now she's suing.
A former staffer on Trump's 2016 campaign says he kissed her ""on the lips"" without consent two months before the general election, and now she's suing. A lawsuit filed Monday says Trump kissed Alva Johnson on his way out of one of the campaign's RVs at a Florida work event. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called the allegation ""absurd on its face"" and said Johnson's description of events contradicts ""multiple highly credible eye witness accounts."" Three Trump supporters who were present, including then-Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, told The Washington Post they did not witness the alleged incident.",0
1346,"Along a dusty stretch of border, flanked by an outlet mall and farmland, a giant crane hoisted a 30-foot-high section of steel barrier and dropped it into a shallow trench last Wednesday. The structure was one of the first new pieces of a border wall put in place since the start of a lengthy construction project in February just west of the border crossing in downtown Calexico, a small, mostly Hispanic farming town. The construction isn’t part of President Donald Trump’s long-promised wall with Mexico. Instead, the barrier is a replacement project first proposed by the U.S. Border Patrol in 2009 under the Obama administration, roughly a decade after the original fencing went up, according to David Kim, the Border Patrol’s assistant chief patrol agent in the area. By mid-October, roughly 2 miles in the Border Patrol’s El Centro sector, which stretches for about half of the Mexican border in California, will have the new, see-through barrier. Mr. Kim said the roughly $18 million project was funded by Congress last year. He said the project happens to be getting under way in the midst of Mr. Trump’s continuing effort to build a wall along the Mexican border. “We want to make sure everyone knows what it is and what it isn’t,” Mr. Kim said. While Mr. Trump’s border-wall plan has drawn scorn from immigration advocates, environmentalists and some lawmakers, Enrique Morones, founder and director of the San Diego-based Border Angels, a nonprofit immigrant aid group, said the replacement fencing was little to worry about, since it was only replacing a barrier that was already there. Lawmakers have yet to fund Mr. Trump’s multibillion-dollar wall proposal, instead approving money primarily for repairs and replacement projects of existing barriers such as the one in Calexico, about 120 miles east of San Diego. In New Mexico, existing vehicle barriers along the border will soon be replaced by new fencing in and around Santa Teresa, near the Texas state line. California has become a flashpoint in the debate over the president’s immigration policies, including his proposal to build a wall. The state has sued the administration multiple times challenging its immigration policies. The wall proposal overcame a legal hurdle last Tuesday when a federal judge in San Diego gave the government the go-ahead to build along the border, despite complaints from environmental advocates and California. The groups sued last year, arguing the Trump administration didn’t have the legal authority to bypass environmental and other regulations to build the barrier. U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, whom Mr. Trump had criticized after the judge ruled against him in litigation involving Trump University, sided with the administration. As part of Mr. Trump’s border plan, eight border-wall prototypes were built last year in San Diego, and the president is expected to tour the mock-ups later this month. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, said the state would evaluate its options for continuing to fight Mr. Trump’s proposal. In a tweet, Mr. Trump called the ruling “a big victory,” but said California wouldn’t be getting any new wall until the entire project was funded. In Calexico, construction crews manned heavy equipment last Wednesday, using the crane to maneuver the cement-filled, steel posts, which are fashioned together at both ends, into the ground. Mr. Kim said the new barriers in Calexico are replacing solid metal panels that sat as high as 18 feet in some areas. But smugglers and border crossers have cut holes in them thousands of times in recent years, requiring near-constant repairs. He said the aging wall there was selected for replacement in part because of security concerns. Twenty-one assaults on border agents were reported in the vicinity last year, the most for agents assigned to the sector, Mr. Kim said. The new bollard-style barriers are likely to be harder to breach and will offer agents more security, because they will be able to see what and who is on the other side. The Border Patrol has established a “First Amendment zone” for potential protesters, Mr. Kim said, but so far the area at the western edge of the project hasn’t been used.",0
688,"A federal judge in Hawaii on Monday narrowed the scope of an injunction he issued in March, after an appeals court concluded his initial order was too broad.
U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson’s March order prohibited the Departments of State and Homeland Security from reviewing federal vetting procedures and preparing reports recommending additional security measures for migrant and refugee entry. Per his new order, State and DHS may begin those reviews, provided they “do not burden individuals outside of the executive branch of the federal government.”
Watson’s order put the administration in something of a bind — the government’s stated rationale for interrupting migrant entry for 90 days was to assess the strength of its vetting processes. The administration claims this assessment is essential for the nation’s continued security. Critics charged that the government was not being forthright about the order’s true objectives, as it had not yet conducted these “vital” policy reviews — but it was Watson’s order that prohibited them from doing so in the first place.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the injunction was overly-broad last week.
The revised injunction makes it slightly less likely the Supreme Court will intervene to amend the injunction, as this dimension of Watson’s ruling was the most obvious error of law. The justices could announce as soon as Thursday whether they will review lower court rulings barring the order’s enforcement.
Should the high court agree to review the case, the government may now be asked about its progress on the vetting assessment in judicial proceedings, creating an additional complication for their defense of the order.",1
228,"Because of multiple lawsuits challenging his declaration of a national emergency, we don’t know if President Trump will be able to carry out his plans to use $8 billion in federal funds to build a barrier along parts of the U.S.-Mexico border to reduce illegal immigration.
But even if the courts side with the president – and even if he then uses billions of dollars more to build additional sections of a border barrier – no wall or fence alone will stop immigrants from crossing our southern border in large numbers.
That’s because in recent years illegal immigrants have learned to exploit loopholes in our asylum laws. Many voluntarily turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents as soon as they cross into the U.S. and fraudulently claim asylum.
Illegal immigrants have been told back in their home countries that requesting asylum unlocks the door to America. Simply making a request will ent the U.S. government from immediately deporting the person seeking asylum.
SUPREME COURT REJECTS TRUMP BID TO ENFORCE ASYLUM CRACKDOWN
Instead, each asylum claim is referred to federal immigration court, where it takes an average of 578 days for a decision to be reached on a request.
Because of this huge court backlog, more than 809,000 immigrants are waiting for their asylum claims to be heard in immigration court. That’s enough people to create the 18th largest city in the U.S.
A wall wouldn't keep out these asylum seekers, who could simply turn themselves in at legal points of entry. To reduce this flow of illegal immigrants, the White House and Congress must close asylum loopholes.
While waiting for a decision on their asylum claims, illegal immigrants get to stay in the U.S. Many don’t show up when their immigration court hearings are finally scheduled and simply continue staying in America illegally. Approximately 600,000 people disappeared before their asylum hearings between 2003 and 2015.
A wall wouldn't keep out these asylum seekers, who could simply turn themselves in at legal points of entry. To reduce this flow of illegal immigrants, the White House and Congress must close asylum loopholes.
Our asylum system wasn't always so prone to abuse. Before 2009, courts only offered asylum to individuals who feared – or had already suffered – persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or membership in a particular social group.
For instance, Chinese Christians fleeing from threats of imprisonment had a strong chance to obtain asylum.
But in 2009, the Obama administration determined that domestic and gang violence should also be grounds for asylum. Foreigners quickly learned that claiming a ""credible fear"" of such violence – regardless of the truth of those claims – would gain them entry into the United States.
The number of asylum seekers predictably ballooned. In 2008, immigration courts received approximately 42,000 asylum requests. The figure of new requests made in 2018 rose to 160,000.
Central Americans file a majority of the asylum requests. The number of Hondurans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans seeking asylum has jumped almost 900 percent since 2012.
This surge wasn't driven by gang or domestic violence. The homicide rate in Honduras has actually fallen by more than 50 percent since 2012. The murder rate in El Salvador has similarly plummeted by more than half. The tiny nation's per capita homicide rate is now lower than Baltimore's. Guatemala has become much safer in recent years as well.
Nearly 80 percent of asylum requests from Hondurans, Guatemalans, and Salvadorans are ultimately denied by U.S. courts – a sure sign that most of these immigrants aren't at unique risk of gang or domestic violence.
Illegal immigrants typically flock to low-skilled jobs, where they compete against less-educated Americans. An excess of low-skilled workers gives employers more leverage to hold down wages for U.S. citizens and legal residents.
According to Harvard economist George Borjas, Americans without high school diplomas earn $800 to $1,500 less each year due to illegal immigration.
Asylum abuse also hurts taxpayers, who foot the bill for the schools, health care programs and social services that illegal immigrants use.
In fact, illegal immigration costs Americans up to an estimated to $116 billion per year.
President Trump’s planned border barrier wouldn't stop this abuse, even if it were built from sea to shining sea, since it doesn't address two major asylum-law loopholes.
Consider the ""Flores settlement,"" a 1997 court ruling that prohibits the U.S. government from detaining migrant children for more than 20 days.
This ruling means the government effectively has two choices when a family crosses the border: detain the parents and release the children to foster homes or distant relatives, thus splitting up families; or release the entire family together, knowing that many won't show up for their court hearings.
Neither option is desirable. Instead, the White House should ask Congress to override the Flores settlement and allow families to be kept together in federal custody until their cases are settled.
The Trump administration should also continue to urge Congress to tweak the Wilberforce Act, which ents immigration authorities from treating all unaccompanied foreign minors equally.
Currently, all minors from countries other than Mexico or Canada are allowed to remain in the United States for a substantial period of time until a full asylum hearing. This gives many minors the hope they can remain long-term.
The law generated a surge of underage migrants from Central America. If Congress amended the law to stop offering guaranteed hearings, it would deter many children from attempting the dangerous journey to the United States.
President Trump was elected to end illegal immigration. He should reverse the actions of President Obama that made getting asylum easier and close other asylum loopholes to end the chaos at the border.

701,"Republican Virginia gubernatorial candidate Corey Stewart is upping the pressure against primary opponent Ed Gillespie and warning that a Gillespie victory “pushes back progress we made in 2016.”
Republican primary voters head to polls on June 13 and Gillespie holds a double-digit lead in public polling. The most recent public poll has Gillespie ahead with 38 percent and Stewart at 18 percent, with 24 percent of voters undecided. Stewart, who chaired President Donald Trump’s Virginia campaign before being sacked over a dispute with the Republican National Committee, told reporters Wednesday to disregard the polls.
“There is a major weakness in the polls, we haven’t had a Republican primary since 2005 so nobody knows who is going to vote,” Stewart, the at-large chairman of Prince William County, said.
The Washington Post reported Monday that Gillespie’s lobbying firm was paid more than $1 million in 2001 by Tyson Foods to help with federal charges regarding smuggling illegal Mexican immigrants to work at its facilities. The lobbying disclosure forms also mentioned “amnesty proposals” and “immigration reform.”
In his response to the Post report, the former RNC chairman Gillespie said he didn’t recall working for Tyson and a spokesman for the food giant put out a statement that said they retained Gillespie’s firm for “public affairs consulting, not lobbying.”
Tyson was acquitted of the criminal charges, but admitted that there was some smuggling of illegal immigrants. Stewart has pounced on this and said at a campaign event,”Ed Gillespie is complicit in smuggling illegal aliens into this country. He’s complicit in human trafficking.”
A spokesman for Gillespie’s campaign responded to this by accusing Stewart’s campaign of having a “a constant stream of fabrication and falsehoods.”
Stewart has focused on this charge and filmed a video for Facebook Live Wednesday outside the Washington office of Quinn, Gillespie & Associates “to discuss The Washington Post’s bombshell article about Ed’s complicity in human trafficking.”
He told reporters this accusation wasn’t going too far as Gillespie had came out in support of the 2013 “Gang of 8” immigration bill that would have given illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.
Stewart has worked to implement anti-illegal immigrant measures at the local level and it has been a main issue on the campaign trail for him. He has also campaigned on “Virginia history,” which is how he refers to his defense of Confederate monuments around the state.
Stewart told reporters a victory by former Bush staffer Gillespie would push back on “progress we made in 2016 of shoving out the establishment.”",1
2222,"A Kurdish family of five on their way to Nashville were stopped in Cairo before they could board their connecting flight Saturday after President Trump ordered a travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries.
Fuad Sharef Suleman, his wife, Arazoo Ibrahim, and their three children were escorted from Cairo International Airport back to Iraq, even though they had valid visas to enter the United States.
Suleman called the executive order an act of racism and discrimination.
""I did not know the president can sign such orders,"" he said. ""Because it looks like those autocratic leaders in corrupt countries, not in a democratic modern country like America.""
Suleman and his family are now stranded with no home and no transportation after having already sold their house, most of their belongings and their vehicles. Suleman quit his job at a pharmaceutical company, Ibrahim resigned from her position as a kindergarten teacher and their children, ages 10-19, left their schools.
They're staying in a family member's house until they figure out what to do next.
Trump signed an executive order Friday banning legal travel by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen for at least three months. The order also suspends the U.S. Refugee Resettlement Program for at least four months. After the initial bans, the nation will only accept travelers from countries with “sufficient safeguards” to ensure the “security and welfare of the United States.”
Syrian refugees are barred indefinitely.
Suleman used to work as a regional translator for RTI International, a research organization with a contract through a U.S. government agency that works to end extreme global poverty and promote democracy abroad. Because those who work with the American government in Iraq are in mortal danger from groups like the Islamic State, Suleman and his family were given special immigrant visas to come to the United States.
Fuad Suleman's wife and three children wait at Cairo International Airport after being told they cannot continue on a connecting flight to New York's JFK Airport on their way to Nashville Jan. 28, 2017. Erbil, where the family is from, is in Kurdistan, a semi-autonomous region in Northern Iraq. Kurdistan is home to the Kurdish Peshmerga — one of the U.S. military's most reliable allies in the fight against ISIS.
Nashville has the largest population of ethnic Kurds in the United States, with estimates ranging from 12,000 to 17,000. The number is difficult to pinpoint because it's not measured by the U.S. Census. Many of the American Kurds came as refugees during the early '90s after Saddam Hussein attacked them using chemical weapons.
In a statement, Nashville Mayor Megan Barry said hearing of this family reminded her of the Suleymans, a Kurdish refugee family Nashville welcomed more than three decades ago. Jiyayi Suleyman was the first American Kurd hired by the Nashville Metropolitan Police Department.
""I know that our city would have embraced and welcomed this family just as we did the Suleymans in 1991 and so many other immigrant and refugee families before and since,"" Barry said of the. ""This arbitrary ban on individuals from certain countries entering the United States is wrong in every way.""
Sen. Steve Dickerson, R-Nashville, said Sunday that while he'd like to see a review of the federal refugee policy and immigration policy, Trump's order goes too far.
""Nashville and Davidson County have long been home to refugees. They make our community stronger and embody the American Dream to the fullest,"" he said in a statement. ""A full ban, based on country of origin, is contrary to bedrock American values, and, in the end, will only serve to empower our enemies abroad.""
Suleman, 51, said he chose Nashville because of its Kurdish community and because he has friends who live here.
""And I read on the internet that Nashville is a growing city, quality of life is good there, jobs are available, crime rates are very, very low, so these are points that encouraged me to choose Nashville,"" he said.
Cairo officials told Suleman that the U.S. embassy in Baghdad sent a message to officials there that the family were not allowed in the U.S., he said.
""When I was looking at the faces of my wife, my children, they were about to faint,"" he said. ""They turned pale, and I told them to sit down and drink some water. It was a terrible moment."" ""Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world — a horrible mess!""
And Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., lauded Trump's order as ""responsible,"" saying that U.S. intelligence agencies need time to ""ascertain the scope of the Islamic terror threat in order to develop proper refugee vetting protocols — if possible.""
Suleman described himself as a secular family man who loves the diversity of America and said he hates extremists who use religion to justify killing people.
But he isn't very happy with Trump either.
""How do you see all people — I mean the whole nation in a certain country — all at the same level?"" he said. ""No, this is not correct. This is not the right way to deal with people.""",0
2674,"The United States will return the first group of migrants seeking U.S. asylum to the Mexican border city of Tijuana on Friday, a Mexican government spokesman said on Thursday.In a major policy change, U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration said on Dec. 20 it would send non-Mexican migrants who cross the U.S. southern border back to wait in Mexico while their asylum requests are processed.
The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not specify the nationalities of those to be returned to Mexico, although the policy was aimed at helping cope with rising numbers of Central Americans seeking asylum in the United States.
The two countries have held two meetings to work out details of the plan to return migrants seeking U.S. asylum across the shared border. Mexico has said it will not accept anybody facing a credible threat in Mexican territory.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond for comment on when the program would begin, although a department official said the policy would not apply to certain vulnerable populations and unaccompanied minors.
Serious doubts exist over whether Mexico can keep Central American asylum seekers who are fleeing poverty and crime safe, especially in border towns that are often more violent than the cities they left.
It is unclear how Mexico plans to house what could be thousands of asylum seekers for the months - or years - it takes U.S. immigration cases to be heard. A backlog of more than 800,000 cases is pending in immigration courts.
The program, dubbed Migrant Protection Protocols by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, is one of a series of measures taken by the Trump administration aimed at making it harder for Central Americans to enter the United States under asylum laws.
Trump argues that the asylum system is abused, calling a process by which many migrants are freed in the United States to await immigration trial “catch and release.”
Trump is demanding $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the Mexican border, triggering a U.S. partial government shutdown that stretched to its 34th day on Thursday and has left 800,000 federal workers without pay.
Illegal crossings at the southern border have dropped dramatically since highs in previous decades, but in recent years more Central American families and unaccompanied children have been migrating to the United States and applications for asylum have ballooned.
Last year, about 93,000 people sought asylum at the southern border, up 67 percent from 2017, according to U.S. government data.",0
127,"President Trump has called for congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday, top Republicans said shortly after a hotly anticipated, contentious closed-door meeting on border security in the Situation Room concluded Wednesday afternoon.
The sit-down apparently ended without any progress made in resolving the ongoing partial federal government shutdown that has persisted for 12 days, and one senior GOP official said Democrats didn't seem interested in listening to what Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had to say.
A source inside the Situation Room told OutletName that it was the consensus of all participants that House Democrats would be able to negotiate once House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is elected speaker of the House on Thursday, as expected.
A White House official separately told OutletName that Trump began the meeting and then turned it over to Nielsen to provide information on the border. Just seconds into the briefing, the official said, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer leaned over to Pelosi and suggested she interrupt Nielsen.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and top House Republicans Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Steve Scalise, R-La., also attended the meeting in the high-security enclave of the White House, which typically is used to handle sensitive information. The location meant that the conversation was not televised, unlike the volatile sitdown during which Democratic leaders talked back to Trump last month.
""We do have a crisis on the border right now. We had a violent mob rush yesterday -- we had a challenge there,"" McCarthy said outside the White House after the meeting, referring to the 150 migrants who were repelled by tear gas on New Year's Day at the southern border. ""The president has asked us to come back Friday, after the [House] leadership races, to try to get this all done.""
""I""m a little disappointed with, I would say, some on the other side,"" McCarthy continued. ""Once the secretary [of Homeland Security] started, Senator Schumer interrupted her, and they really didn't want to hear it.""
Instead, McCarthy said, Democrats wanted to push their proposed spending bill without funding for the president's proposed border wall.
Schumer, in his own remarks to reporters, said Republicans are ""now feeling the heat"" as a result of the shutdown. He charged that Republican leaders essentially were holding the federal government ""hostage.""
""So, the bottom line is very simple,"" Schumer said. ""We asked the president to support the bills that we support that will open up government.""
In an interview Wednesday, Pelosi told OutletName' Savannah Guthrie that Democrats would give the president ""nothing for the wall.""
""We can go through the back and forth. No. How many more times can we say no? Nothing for the wall,"" Pelosi said.
A senior House Republican member told OutletName as the meeting was underway that the president was likely to stand firm, and that the partial shutdown may soon become the longest in history -- exceeding even the 21-day shutdown that ended in January 1996.
In an interview published over the weekend, outgoing White House chief of staff John Kelly stated that the White House itself has abandoned plans for a concrete wall, opting instead for a system of steel slats at the border -- a proposal Trump has advocated, while also insisting a wall will be built.
""It doesn't have to last much longer at all -- I think we can come to an agreement rather quickly,"" McCarthy responded when asked how long the shutdown would continue. ""I know that's why the president thought maybe after the leadership races, people would be more willing to come to an agreement.""
In a Cabinet meeting earlier Wednesday that served as a preview of the briefing with Hill leaders, the president maintained his stance that funding for a wall along the southern border would be a necessary component of any spending bill to reopen the remainder of the federal government.
""Once the secretary [of Homeland Security] started, Senator [Chuck] Schumer interrupted her."" — GOP House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy
“If they knew they couldn’t come through, they wouldn’t even start,” Trump said at the meeting with Cabinet secretaries and top advisers. “We have to have a wall.”
He pointed to the New Year's Day episode in which an estimated 150 migrants apparently tried to rush the southern border near Tijuana, Mexico. Some of the migrants threw rocks at U.S. officials and reportedly hoisted babies over their heads, as Border Patrol responded with tear gas.
“We need a wall and in the end, I believe we will be successful,"" Trump said, arguing that drones and technology alone would not have deterred the 150 migrants.
HOW SANCTUARY STATE LAW PROTECTED ALLEGED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT COP-KILLER FROM DEPORTATION
Trump said the U.S.-Mexico border has been “like a sieve,” and vowed to “make a plea” for his border wall.
The Democratic package to end the shutdown would include one bill to temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels — with $1.3 billion for border security, far less than Trump has said he wants for the wall — through Feb. 8 as talks continued.
It also would include another measure to fund the departments of Agriculture, Interior, Housing and Urban Development and others closed by the partial shutdown. That measure would provide money through the remainder of the fiscal year, to Sept. 30.
Pelosi said Tuesday that Democrats would take action to ""end the Trump Shutdown"" by passing legislation to reopen the government Thursday, when the new Congress is seated. Whether the Republican-led Senate would consider the Democratic funding bills — or if Trump would sign either into law — was unclear. McConnell spokesman Donald Stewart said Senate Republicans would not take action without Trump's backing.
The shutdown began on Dec. 22, as Democrats vowed to block any funding for Trump’s border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and Trump insisted on billions for the long-promised barrier.
While much of the federal government has been running as normal, the partial shutdown has forced hundreds of thousands of federal workers to stay home or work without pay, and has closed some federal services and tourist sites. Approximately a quarter of federal workers are affected.
For his part, Trump has remarked that he had been ""lonely"" at the White House during the holiday break, having skipped his getaway to Mar-a-Lago in Florida. He claimed his only companions were the ""machine gunners,"" referring to security personnel, and ""they don't wave, they don't smile.""
He also criticized Pelosi for vacationing in Hawaii during the shutdown, even as she blamed the White House for failing to resolve it.
NANCY PELOSI'S DAUGHTER ISSUES WARNING: 'SHE'LL CUT YOUR HEAD OFF'
On Tuesday morning, after tweeting a New Year's message to ""EVERYONE INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA,"" Trump tweeted: ""The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security.""
But he seemed to shift tactics later in the day, appealing to Pelosi. ""Let's make a deal?"" he tweeted.

225,"After years of surging immigration from Central America, law enforcement in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley are finally seeing some relief, thanks in part to President Trump’s strong rhetoric.
“Words matter,” said Christopher Sabatini, an expert in Latin American affairs at Columbia University in New York City. “The rhetoric has mattered. There is a sense of fear that immigrant families, without legal status, without papers are going to be sent back down.”
That fear prompted a dramatic change in behavior among illegal immigrants that few predicted. For three years, a flood of unaccompanied children, women and families made the hazardous trek north from Hondurans, El Salvador and Guatemala, through Mexico to the U.S. Border. Now they are not coming.
“We’re at a trickle,” said Chris Cabrera, with the National Border Council. “It hasn’t stopped but it’s slowed considerably that we’re at a point where we have empty cells now.”
SESSIONS: BORDER CROSSINGS DOWN 60 PERCENT DUE TO 'TRUMP'S STRONG LEADERSHIP'
That added bed space is allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold immigrants longer. Previously, Central American immigrants turned themselves in, claimed asylum and were released.
In most cases, the Obama Administration accommodated the claim by placing the applicant on a court docket with a two- to three-year waiting list. In the meantime, most illegal immigrants were free to work while living with relatives. Some set down roots by getting married or having American-born children.
President Trump promised to end that ’catch and release’ policy, saying “anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country.”
Apparently that message got through thousands of miles away.
“Since January, we have seen a significant decrease in traffic to the point we’re averaging about 150 alien apprehensions a day,” down from as many as 1,000 a day, according to Deputy Chief Raul Ortiz of the Rio Grande Border Patrol Sector. “A big part of the decrease, I think, has to do with a lot of the discussion about the buildup of infrastructure on the southwest border, more agents along the border and some of the message making its way down to those host countries.”
DHS' KELLY DEFENDS MORE ICE, BORDER HIRES; SAYS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS MUST BE 'DEALT WITH'
And with traffic down, more enforcement means higher smuggling costs, detained immigrants tell the Border Patrol.
“If you think that you are not going to be able to stay with relatives, you are not going to spend $8 to $9,000 to cross just to get caught and sent back,” said Border Patrol agent Marlene Castro while overlooking the once busy Rio Grande.
Border Patrol numbers tell the story. Since the election, apprehensions have fallen every month, from 15,000 families and unaccompanied minors in November to just over 1,000 today.
Cabrera believes media reports surrounding ICE arrests, the proposed wall and the president’s vows to enforce the law scared many illegal immigrants into staying home.
“The media has a big say in what happens,” he said. “They put that out there and people come or don’t come, depending on what they say.”
The same holds true, he said, of President Obama. Though his administration also vowed to deport most illegal immigrants and even produced an expensive ad campaign in Central America urging residents to stay home, the headlines told a different story – of immigrants getting temporary amnesty and freedom from custody for those claiming asylum. By contrast, President Trump hasn’t actually done much.
“Without any real concrete changes in policies, without any real tightening of the border wall, without any of the $1.5 billion worth of increased funding yet for Homeland Security and the border guard, we are seeing the numbers that it is having an effect on people’s calculation of the risk of crossing the border illegally,” said Sabatini.
The administration has elaborate plans to strengthen both the border and the court system to diminish the ‘pull’ factors in illegal immigration.
So far, the Department of Justice has reassigned 25 judges from the interior to the border to help streamline the process and keep immigrants in custody until their asylum claims are completed.",1
2653,"There was no sign of relief on Wednesday for 800,000 federal workers going without pay because of the partial government shutdown as the U.S. Senate scheduled votes on competing proposals facing steep odds to end the month-long impasse triggered by President Trump’s demand for border wall funding.Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he planned to hold a vote on Thursday on a Democratic proposal that would fund the government for three weeks but does not include the $5.7 billion in U.S.-Mexico border wall funding that Trump wants.
Its prospects appeared grim. The House of Representatives has passed several similar bills but Trump has rejected legislation that does not include border wall funding. McConnell previously said he would not consider a bill that Trump did not support.
McConnell also planned to hold a vote on legislation that would include border wall funding and temporary relief for “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the United States as children, a compromise Trump proposed on Saturday.
Democrats have dismissed the deal, saying they would not negotiate on border security before reopening the government, and that they would not trade a temporary restoration of the immigrants’ protections from deportation in return for a permanent border wall they view as ineffective.
Trump’s plan is “wrapping paper on the same partisan package,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday.
Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown on Wednesday said it was up to Congress to resolve the impasse. “President Trump is not going to end this,” he told MSOutletName.
Republican Senator Mike Rounds said he hopes lawmakers will find some common ground on the legislation.
“The president’s taken the first steps, he’s proposed his deal,” Rounds said on OutletName on Wednesday. “It may not be acceptable in its current form to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but it was a step forward from where he was.”
Trump, in a series of morning tweets, pushed fellow Republicans to stand by his promised border wall. He is scheduled to discuss his immigration plan with local leaders in a call on Wednesday morning and with conservative leaders at the White House later in the day.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Wednesday that Trump also has made calls to Democrats.
The hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are furloughed or working without pay are struggling to make ends meet as the shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, entered its 33rd day. Many have turned to unemployment assistance, food banks and other support, or have sought new jobs.
A OutletName/Ipsos poll last week found more than half of Americans blame Trump for the shutdown even as he has sought to shift blame to Democrats after initially saying he would be “proud” to shutter the government.",0
39,"President Trump on Tuesday slammed Democrats who shared pictures of child migrants sleeping in cages to knock his immigration policies, only to backtrack after realizing the photos were taken during the Obama administration. “Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages,” Trump tweeted. “They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires.” One photo of children in a cell was shared numerous times over the weekend amid outrage over Trump administration policies of separating illegal immigrant parents from their children at the southern border. Trump opponents who shared the photo included activists, journalists and former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau, who said: “This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.” However, that photo and other related images were published by The Arizona Republic in 2014, deep into Obama’s second term. Favreau later deleted the tweet, as did others who had used the pictures to blast the Trump administration. On Tuesday, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told ""OutletName & Friends"" that the backtrack suggests those critics were only interested in the photos as a partisan weapon. ""They didn't really care about the story about the migrant children,"" she said. The photos were circulated amid a debate over the Justice Department’s zero-tolerance policy when it comes to arresting illegal immigrants. That policy refers all illegal border crossings for prosecution. Since children cannot be held in adult detention centers, they are often separated. The Justice Department says the goal is to deter potential illegal immigrants from trying to cross the border, though critics say it is inhumane. “If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said this month. “If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you, as required by law.” On Tuesday, Trump also called for a “bipartisan bill” that would include funding for the wall at the southern border and “new Border Protection for good of country.” It echoes a tweet Trump sent on Saturday where he called for Democrats to “end the horrible law that separated children from [their] parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.” and included demands for stricter immigration laws.",1
824,"As the initial wave of Central American migrants traveling in a caravan streamed into Tijuana on Tuesday, many of them broke from the group and scaled the border fence just south of San Diego’s International Friendship Park.
Video taken by the San Diego Union-Tribune shows dozens of migrants climbing to the top of the barrier, where they waved and whistled at Border Patrol agents standing guard a few hundred feet away.
In a statement released Tuesday, the Border Patrol said it believes some of the people who climbed onto the fences are from the caravan of about 4,000 migrants that has been making its way north through Mexico for the past several weeks, FOX5 San Diego reported.
Tuesday’s scene near Friendship Park was reminiscent of what happened when a similar caravan of migrants arrived in Tijuana in April. In that instance, caravan migrants scrambled to the top of the border fence and waved the national flag of Honduras, the country many had fled just weeks before. The latest caravan has been the impetus for the Trump administration’s multi-pronged crackdown on illegal immigration in recent weeks. Characterizing the group as a potential “invasion” of U.S. territory, President Donald Trump ordered thousands of active duty troops to the southwest border and issued a proclamation making ineligible for asylum anyone caught crossing the border illegally.
Critics of the response have accused Trump of ginning up fear of the migrant caravan for political purposes. Others have questioned the necessity of using the U.S. military to guard against the migrants, most of whom are expected to crowd ports of entry in order to apply for asylum.
A few hundred of the caravan migrants who were able to board buses have already arrived in Tijuana, and the bulk of the group is expected to show up over the next few weeks. Officials in Baja California state, where Tijuana is the largest city, say local shelters can accommodate roughly 900 people as they wait for a chance to apply for asylum at a port of entry.
Meanwhile, thousands of migrants — mostly Central Americans like those traveling in the caravan — reach the U.S-Mexico border and attempt to slip across on a weekly basis.
In October, the number of migrants arrested trying to cross the southwest border illegally was about 51,000, or 1,700 per day. More than half of that number were people traveling in family units, according to Customs and Border Protection.",1
2666,"""OK, Mr Trump, you don't want them released, show me where you are going to hold them - show me the building,"" said Ruben Garcia, the director of Annunciation House, a Roman Catholic charity in El Paso, Texas, that gives shelter to migrant families.
Garcia's group received more than 400 migrants released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement just between Monday and Wednesday, the day Trump announced tougher measures to curb illegal immigration.
""They are releasing them not because they want to do catch and release, but because detention centers don't have enough space,"" said Garcia.
That underscores one potential problem of ending the practice of ""catch and release"" - almost half the immigrants apprehended by U.S. officials are now Central American families or children, and only a tiny number of detention spaces are available for those categories of immigrants.
Trump did announce plans to increase the number of family detention centers, but establishing them will take time and could face legal challenges, legal experts on immigration said.
A OutletName review of U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data shows an accelerating trend of Central American families who hand themselves in at the border and are released while awaiting deportation or a decision on an asylum request.
In the last three months of 2016, the number of people - almost all of them families and children - who handed themselves in to agents along the U.S.-Mexican border rose by a quarter versus the same period the year before, CBP data shows.
Agents apprehended a total of 136,670 people crossing the Mexican border, the highest number since 2008, and 48 percent of those were unaccompanied children or families with children.
Nearly 45,000 parents with children were apprehended in the October-December quarter, but the border currently has beds for only around 3,300 people in this category of immigrants, mostly at the Karnes and Dilley detention centers in Texas, according to ICE data from 2016.
Because most of the families are from Central America, they cannot immediately be turned around and sent back to Mexico.
Lack of space in detention centers for parents with children means that almost all such migrants, who are mostly fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, are fitted with an electronic ankle bracelet, given a court date and released.
Many end up requesting asylum, a process that can take five or more years to be resolved, immigration lawyers say. Even without requesting asylum, it can take years to deport families through the United States' bunged-up immigration courts.
Trump could expand a policy practiced under former President Barack Obama of using military bases to temporarily house more immigrants. The Fort Bliss base in El Paso has housed thousands of children since September, for example.
He could also explore ways to refit other existing facilities to help handle the flood of families.
Building more detention centers like Karnes and Dilley will take longer. They also typically face legal challenges by civil rights lawyers concerned about the living conditions in them.
Trump could also seek to expand an Obama program aimed at increasing the number of Central American asylum seekers who make their initial claim from their home country.
In the long term, he could ask Mexico to let immigrants make the asylum claims from there, although ties between the two countries are now seriously frayed because of Trump's vow to force Mexico to pay for a wall on the southern U.S. border.
Garcia, the shelter director, acknowledged that if Trump was finally successful in opening thousands more detention spaces for families, that would slow the numbers coming.
""The word would spread that the probability they will be locked up and put on a plane had become much higher,"" Garcia said. Central Americans are usually deported from the United States on flights back to their home countries.
""WANT TO BE APPREHENDED""
While the number of ""turn-ins"" - those who hand themselves in to U.S. authorities - are highest around McAllen, Texas, the jump has been particularly noticeable in the El Paso sector of the border with Mexico. Here, 60 percent of the immigrants apprehended between October and December were children or families.
For years a quiet spot on the immigration map, El Paso saw 5,200 families apprehended in the period, nearly three times as many compared to the same period a year ago, and 1,972, or double, the number of unaccompanied children.
U.S Border Patrol agent Jose Romero has observed the trend first-hand along the tall, rust-colored fence punctuated with rural border crossings stretching some 40 miles (65 km) from El Paso to beyond Tornillo, Texas.
""A lot of the traffic we are seeing right now is family groups ... coming across and they are looking for an agent right away to turn themselves in,"" Romero said, calling it a change from the past, when more people were trying to sneak in undetected. ""They want to be apprehended.""
The fence, finished in 2010, ends abruptly near pecan orchards and irrigation ditches on the Texan side, across the Rio Grande from Mexico's drug war-torn Valle de Juarez, a cotton-farming region now littered with burned-out homes.
Last February, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Obama's secretary of commerce, Penny Pritzker, opened a major new border crossing from Tornillo on the Texan side, to Guadalupe on the Mexican side, hoping to boost trade between the countries.
By November, truck traffic was still light across the bridge.
Instead, ICE opened a temporary holding center, with 500 places in white tents on the asphalt on the U.S. side of the bridge, to help process some of the surging numbers of migrant families apprehended by U.S. officials in the surrounding area.",0
2663,"U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told President Donald Trump on Wednesday that he may not deliver a State of the Union speech in the chamber of the House of Representatives until the 33-day-old partial government shutdown has ended.Responding forcefully to a letter from the president earlier in the day in which he essentially dared her to disinvite him, Pelosi said in a letter to Trump that the House would not consider a measure authorizing the speech for now.
“Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened,” Pelosi said to Trump in her letter.
In response to the letter, Trump told reporters at a healthcare-related event at the White House that he would respond to Pelosi in a timely manner.
The State of the Union speech, an annual rite in American politics that is typically used by presidents to announce their policy goals for the coming year, has become a hostage to the standoff between Trump and congressional Democrats over his demands for funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall.
That demand triggered a partial government shutdown on Dec. 22 when some U.S. agencies’ funding expired for reasons unrelated to border security or immigration. In discussions about legislation to restore funding, Trump initially signaled support.
Then he changed his stance and demanded that any shutdown-ending measure must contain $5.7 billion to help pay for a border wall, a demand that Democrats oppose. They have since insisted that the government be fully reopened before they will discuss border security.
Pelosi on Jan. 16 asked Trump to consider postponing the speech because of the shutdown, which has left 800,000 federal workers on furlough or working without pay.
Trump said on Wednesday he planned to deliver the address before the U.S. Congress as scheduled on Jan. 29 in the House of Representatives’ chamber, rejecting Pelosi’s request.
In an escalation of rhetoric that essentially dared Pelosi to disinvite him, Trump told her in a letter, which the White House released, that he was “looking forward” to giving the speech, an annual event in American politics.
“It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location!” Trump wrote.
In her initial request, Pelosi cited concerns about security for the event, traditionally attended by both houses of Congress, most of the president’s Cabinet, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the justices of the Supreme Court.
House staffers said there has been no preparatory “walk-through,” as is customary a few days ahead of the speech, involving security officials and House personnel.
Trump brushed aside security concerns. In his letter, he said the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Secret Service had told him there would be “absolutely no problem” with security for the evening address on Capitol Hill.
“Therefore, I will be honoring your invitation, and fulfilling my Constitutional duty, to deliver important information to the people and Congress of the United States of America regarding the State of our Union,” Trump wrote to Pelosi. “I look forward to seeing you on the evening of January 29th in the Chamber of the House of Representatives.”Trump sees the border wall as necessary to help stop illegal immigration and drugs from entering the country. Democrats reject the wall as a costly and ineffective step.
Pelosi, speaker since Jan. 3 when Democrats took over majority control of the House, like many other senior lawmakers from both parties has clashed with Trump.
On Jan. 17, the president canceled a flight Pelosi had been scheduled to take on a U.S. military plane just hours before she and several other lawmakers were set to travel to Afghanistan to visit U.S. troops.",0
1230,"Efforts to reach a deal that would keep the government running and address sticky immigration and spending issues derailed on Tuesday, after Democratic leaders pulled out of a planned White House meeting in response to jabs by President Donald Trump on Twitter. Current funding for the government expires at 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 9, giving lawmakers little more than a week to pass short-term legislation keeping it fully operational. Although Congress could still pass a short-term measure, which usually isn’t controversial, Tuesday’s public dispute indicated that that subsequent negotiations for an expected longer-term package at year’s end face partisan headwinds. The skirmish began Tuesday morning when Mr. Trump tweeted that he planned to take a tough line on any discussions over immigration that come up in negotiations on keeping the government funded beyond next week. “Meeting with ‘Chuck and Nancy’ today about keeping government open and working,” Mr. Trump tweeted, referring to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.). Mr. Trump continued by saying they want “illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked.” He added, “I don’t see a deal!” Mr. Trump’s tweet angered the Democratic leaders, who said they saw no point in visiting the White House for what they deemed fruitless talks. “It would be a waste of everyone’s time to continue working with someone who clearly has no interest in coming to an agreement,” Mr. Schumer told reporters. The Democratic leaders sought to meet instead with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), but they kept their appointment with Mr Trump. Should the impasse continue over spending and force a government shutdown next month, Mr. Trump said he “would absolutely blame the Democrats.” On Tuesday evening the president said on Twitter: “I ran on stopping illegal immigration and won big. They can’t now threaten a shutdown to get their demands.” Democrats said voters would hold Republicans responsible, given that they control the White House and both chambers of Congress. “The American people know they’re running the show,” Mr. Schumer said. If the government does shut down, many federal employees would be furloughed, but those deemed essential to protecting life or property would still be required to show up to work. The public blowup between Mr. Trump and the Democrats marks a sharp contrast with an earlier meeting back in September. In that gathering, Mr. Trump shocked GOP leaders by overriding their objections and striking a deal with Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer to keep the government funded until early December, raising the federal government’s borrowing limit and passing relief aid for victims of severe storms. There are other, more volatile issues in play this time. Democrats and some Republicans have indicated they hope to include protections in the year-end spending bill for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. at a young age by their parents. Mr. Trump in September ended a program protecting many of these immigrants, known as Dreamers, but he gave Congress until March to come up with legislation handling the Dreamers’ fate. Some Democrats have said they wouldn’t vote for a spending bill that doesn’t include protections for Dreamers, though leaders have generally been vague about whether they would move to shutter the government if the spending bill doesn’t address their concerns. Many Republicans also want to pass legislation protecting the Dreamers from deportation, but they are likely to want border security and immigration-enforcement measures to go along with it. Democrats have said they are open to some enforcement measures, but would oppose construction of a physical wall along the length of the border with Mexico. GOP leaders have said they want to address immigration in a separate bill, but Democrats have leverage in the year-end talks. The spending bill would require 60 votes in the Senate to advance, meaning Republicans, who control 52 seats, need Democrats to come on board. In the House, many Republicans often balk at supporting spending bills, so GOP leaders typically need Democratic votes to reach a majority. Congressional leaders also need to reach an agreement on overall spending levels for the remainder of fiscal year 2018. Once Congress has agreed to an overall funding level, lawmakers can then turn to writing the detailed spending legislation that divvies that money up for the rest of fiscal year 2018, which ends next Sept. 30. Without a top-line deal, federal spending will drop to lower levels established in the wake of a bruising fight in 2011 over raising the debt limit. Congressional leaders and White House officials have been discussing a two-year budget deal that would raise spending by about $200 billion over two years. Republicans want to raise military spending but have balked at boosting nondefense spending by an equivalent amount. Democrats are pushing for comparable increases on both sides.",0
2573,"Mexican authorities will meet with Central American officials to prepare for the arrival of a planned new caravan of migrants headed to the United States next week.The head of Mexico’s immigration office, Tonatiuh Guillen, left on Wednesday on a trip to El Salvador and Honduras to meet with his counterparts and other authorities, said Interior Ministry spokesman Hector Gandini.
Mexico hopes to discourage a mass exodus from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, and wants Central Americans who decide to migrate north to do so in an orderly way and through legal ports of entry.
“The doors to Mexico are open to anyone who wants to enter in an orderly fashion,” Gandini told OutletName in a telephone interview. “But whoever wants to come in illegally will be deported.”
Previous Central American caravans became a flashpoint in the debate over U.S. immigration policy.
That was intensified by the recent deaths of two migrant children in American custody and a partial U.S. government shutdown over U.S. President Donald Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the border with Mexico.
There are 12 legal ports of entry for Central Americans on Mexico’s southern border, but Mexican authorities have identified an additional 370 illegal points of entry on that frontier, Interior Minister Olga Sanchez said this week.
Mexico borders in the south with Guatemala and Belize.
The illegal entry points will be “monitored and controlled to avoid undocumented access of people to our territory,” Sanchez said.
Guatemala’s deputy foreign minister, Pablo Cesar Garcia, met with Mexican authorities on Tuesday to discuss the caravan and to “provide all the necessary support to the migrants,” said Guatemalan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marta Larra.
“In Honduras, they kill us,” read an appeal circulating on social media for people to assemble in the violent Honduran city of San Pedro Sula next Tuesday to start the long trek north to the United States.
While other social media posts invite people to leave from nearby Santa Barbara on Jan. 20, U.S. authorities hoped to dissuade Central Americans from making the journey.
“The risks of illegal immigration are serious. Don’t waste your time and money on a trip destined to fail. The road is long and very dangerous. Thousands of Hondurans who participated in the caravan came back sorry,” Heide Fulton, the U.S chargé d’affaires to Honduras, said on Twitter on Wednesday.",0
70,"President Trump made his case to the American people in an Oval Office address Tuesday night for funding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border as a means of protecting our nation and ending the ongoing partial government shutdown. And the top Democrats in Congress – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York – followed minutes later by making the opposite case in their own televised remarks, saying a wall is not needed. The president and congressional Democrats remain locked in a standoff over the president’s demand for more than $5 billion to build the border wall, in the third week of the second-longest government shutdown in U.S. history. President Trump called the situation on the southern border both a “humanitarian” and “national security” crisis. He added: “The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only, because Democrats will not fund border security … the only solution is for the Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our border and reopens the government.” Trump is obviously sidestepping the fact that on their first day in control of the House last week, the new Democratic majority did in fact pass a spending bill that increased border security and would have reopened the government. The president continued in his address to the nation: “Hopefully, we can all rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.” Ultimately, now is the time for compromise, not political posturing. For the sake of the nation and of his presidency, the president needs to relent on his hardline demand for over $5 billion in border wall funding, and should be willing to make a deal with the Democrats. And a bipartisan solution may be possible. Throughout 2017, Schumer was working on a deal to provide the Trump administration with funding for a border wall in exchange for protection from deportation for DACA recipients – some 700,000 young people brought to the U.S. as children in violation of our immigration laws. This deal made sense then, and it makes sense now. The need for compromise is clear, and it is up to both President Trump and congressional Democrats to put partisanship aside and make a deal for the good of the nation. In his own response to the president Tuesday night, Schumer said: “There is bipartisan legislation – supported by Democrats and Republicans – to reopen government while allowing debate over border security to continue.” Pelosi and Schumer were able to use their remarks as an opportunity to show America that the Democrats are willing and able to be the party of leadership that promotes effective alternatives to the Trump administration. It does not help the president’s cause in negotiating with Democrats that the data and purported facts his administration uses to defend the border wall are often questionable, if not inaccurate. On Sunday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the administration’s immigration agenda when facing questions from Chris Wallace of OutletName. “Nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border,” Sanders said, giving the frequently quoted statistic from the Trump administration. “I know this statistic,” Wallace jumped in, “I didn’t know if you were going to use it, so I studied up on this. Do you know where those 4,000 people … where they’re captured? Airports.” Indeed, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data that was provided to Congress in 2018 states that CBP only encountered six immigrants at ports of entry on the U.S-Mexico border in the first half of fiscal year 2018 who were known or suspected terrorists. However, we cannot forget that immigration reform is a legitimate and concerning issue that needs to be addressed by lawmakers. And this can only be done through bipartisan legislation. The need for compromise is clear, and it is up to both President Trump and congressional Democrats to put partisanship aside and make a deal for the good of the nation. Democrats and Republicans are only weakening the country by closing down the government over the wall. It makes no sense for Democrats to walk away from a valid proposal to protect our country. Compromise is possible, and I implore both Republicans and Democrats to come to a consensus and provide funding for the wall as a tradeoff for protections for DACA recipients.",1

77,"Voters in Sweden handed the ruling Social Democrats their worst result in decades Sunday, while the far-right Sweden Democrats were projected to become the third-largest party in Stockholm's parliament. With almost all the ballots counted, the Social Democrats had emerged as the largest party but had just 28.3 percent of the vote, making it likely to lose a significant number of seats. The Moderates party was next at 19.8 percent, followed by the Sweden Democrats at 17.6 percent. That's a 4.6 percent increase in their vote share from the last election, held in 2014. Sunday's results make it unlikely that any party will have a majority of the 175 seats in the Riksdagen, Sweden's parliament. It could take weeks or months of coalition talks before the next government is formed. Both the left-leaning bloc led by the Social Democrats and the center-right bloc have said they would refuse to consider the Sweden Democrats as a potential coalition partner. Sunday's election was the first since the Swedish government in 2015 allowed 163,000 migrants into the Scandinavian country with a population of 10 million. The number was far lower than the asylum-seekers Germany accepted that year, but the highest per capita of any European nation. The Sweden Democrats — led by Jimmie Akesson — worked to soften its neo-Nazi image while helping to break down longstanding taboos on what Swedes could say openly about immigration and integration without being shunned as racists. The potential of a surge by the party had many Swedes worried about an erosion of the humanitarian values that have long been a foundation of their country's identity. ""This election is a referendum about our welfare,"" Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said. ""It's also about decency, about a decent democracy ... and not letting the Sweden Democrats, an extremist party, a racist party, get any influence in the government."" At the party's rally on Saturday, Akesson strongly criticized Lofven's government for ""prioritizing"" the cause of immigrants over the needs of citizens. ""This government we have had now ... they have prioritised, during these four years, asylum-seekers,"" Akesson said, giving an exhaustive list of things he says the government has failed to do for Swedish society because of migrants.",1
646,"The Trump administration recently narrowed the definition of sanctuary cities at risk of losing grants to noncompliance of a law that likely only a few jurisdictions don’t follow.
However, the budget proposal introduced by the White House Monday changes the definition of this law to make potentially over 100 jurisdictions at risk of losing grants.
Trump’s executive order stripping certain federal grants from sanctuary cities that was temporarily blocked by a federal judge pertained to a statute, 8 USC 1373, which doesn’t allow allow local officials to restrict information about an individual’s immigration status from the federal government.
However, conservative pundits and politicians frequently refer to sanctuary cities as jurisdictions that refuse to comply with immigration detainers. A document released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in March identified 118 jurisdictions that limit compliance with these detainers. The detainer requests ask agencies to hold individuals for up to 48 hours in order for ICE officers to pick them up or to let ICE know when the detainee is being released.
However, the number of jurisdictions in non-compliance with 8 USC 1373 is likely very small. The Department of Justice sent a letter to just nine jurisdictions in April asking them to confirm that they are in compliance. The DOJ held a meeting with lawyers that month to let them know that refusing to comply with detainers doesn’t put them at risk of losing funding. Liberal mayors rejoiced at this interpretation.
The Trump budget, however, redefines the law to include jurisdictions that don’t comply with an immigration detainer. This budget was introduced the same day that Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a memo saying that sanctuary cities aren’t those that refuse to comply with detainers in respect to Trump’s executive order. The liberal group America’s Progress pegged the move as a “sneak attack.”
The budget also requires agencies to share more than just the immigration status of an individual. It would now include the nationality, citizenship, immigration status, removability, scheduled date and time, home address, work address, or contact information of someone in custody or suspected of violating the law.
If Congress adopts the budget — which multiple Republican have called “dead on arrival” — sanctuary jurisdictions could lose DHS and DOJ grants. This provision about sanctuary cities would be a win for Trump’s hardline immigration agenda in a budget proposal that only funds 60 miles of new border walling and allocates money for the resettlement of 50,000 new refugees.
This reinterpretation could also be redundant if Congress passes the Davis-Oliver Act — a bill that introduces a similar definition of sanctuary city and also applies the same grant restrictions. This act gained the House Judiciary Committee’s approval Wednesday and the White House supports its passage.",1
1456,"The same remote desert border crossing used by a 7-year-old girl who recently died in government custody is seeing a surge in families and children that the Border Patrol is unequipped to handle, its chief said Tuesday. Jakelin Caal’s death, which has drawn criticism and heated up rhetoric around U.S. immigration policy, comes amid a problem current and former Border Patrol agents say has been growing for years: An agency designed to deter and deport adults traveling alone to find work now spends most of its time dealing with vulnerable families who want asylum. Last month, nearly 59% of people arrested at the border were families or unaccompanied children, most of whom were fleeing violence and poverty in Central America, according to government statistics. Just six years ago, nearly 90% were single adults, primarily from Mexico. The changes can be seen at every Border Patrol station, where storage spaces have been turned into pantries packed with baby formula, Pampers, fruit snacks and juice boxes. In the Yuma sector, which stretches across 126 miles of border in southeastern Arizona and Southern California, agents spent more than 25% of their time, or about 9,000 man-hours, last year on tasks like feeding children and chauffeuring families 200 miles to the nearest bus station, in Phoenix. “When they are in our care, it’s a humanitarian issue,” Carla Provost, chief of the U.S. Border Patrol, said of the influx of families. “But we have a border-security mission that suffers at the hands of the humanitarian mission.” In Antelope Wells, N.M., one of the most remote patches of desert near the Mexican border, nearly 500 migrants crossed the border illegally in a 72-hour period this week and turned themselves in to request asylum, said Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan. CBP is starting to send agents, including medical personnel, to Antelope Wells. U.S. authorities suspect the area may be popular because it is remote and, on the Mexican side of the border, not controlled by criminal organizations that charge smugglers to bring migrants through. Illegal crossings in the area, roughly 90 miles from the nearest fully staffed Border Patrol station, have increased 10-fold since 2014. Many of the migrants have reported to border agents that they rode on commercial buses from Guatemala, Mr. McAleenan said. Jakelin’s father said he and his daughter were among those to arrive via bus, said a government official familiar with their case. The pair spent hours in a garage, along with more than 100 other migrants, waiting for government transportation to take them to be processed. Jakelin became ill while on the bus and died about a day later at a hospital in El Paso, Texas. The circumstances of her detention and death have become a political controversy and are being investigated. Lawyers for her father said Wednesday they wanted an independent review of the case. Border Patrol veterans say it is common that holding cells and other facilities that never intended to house migrants for more than a few hours are now being used to keep families, including children, for as long as a few days. Portable showers have been installed in at least one station in Arizona because the cells have just a toilet and a small sink. The strategy behind the Border Patrol’s current resources and deployment, most recently updated in 2012, was created to deal with single adults who were captured and quickly deported to Mexico. Most families and unaccompanied children crossing now eagerly seek out agents in order to request asylum. Regulations and court rulings typically mandate that asylum-seekers be held for days by the Border Patrol before being handed off to other immigration agencies or released and allowed to wait in the U.S. while an immigration judge decides their fate, a process that could take years. “We never considered people trying to surrender,” Victor Manjarrez, a retired Border Patrol sector chief who oversaw the El Paso and Tucson sectors, said of the agency’s strategy and infrastructure. Mr. McAleenan has previously asked Congress to overhaul immigration laws to make it easier to quickly decide if migrants can stay in the country and deport those who don’t win protections here. Most immediately, Mr. McAleenan said he would like to see funding for new facilities specifically for families and unaccompanied children along with staff, including trauma specialists, who are better trained to care for such migrants. “We have to move toward a system where they aren’t in Border Patrol stations,” Mr. McAleenan said of families and children arrested at the border.",0
2434,"Some 200,000 Salvadoran immigrants allowed to live and work in the United States since 2001 will lose their right to remain in the country in 2019, officials said on Monday, marking the Trump administration’s latest move to tighten immigration enforcement. The United States will end the Salvadorans’ temporary protected status (TPS) on Sept. 9, 2019, giving them 18 months to leave or seek lawful residency, and for El Salvador to prepare for their return, administration officials said. The status was granted in the wake of two devastating 2001 earthquakes in El Salvador that left hundreds of thousands in the country homeless. The decision to end TPS for Salvadorans is part of the administration’s broader push to tighten immigration laws and expel those living in the United States illegally. The move was heavily criticized by immigrant advocates who said it ignored violence in El Salvador and gave the Salvadorans few options but to leave the United States or remain illegally. The Trump administration has faced a series of deadlines over the past year to decide whether to end the protected status of immigrants in the United States whose home countries have been affected by disasters. Salvadorans are by far the largest group under TPS, a program administration officials said is supposed to provide a temporary haven for victims, not a permanent right to remain in the United States. Critics have complained TPS has allowed participants to repeatedly extend their stays in 6-month to 18-month increments. Patricia Hernandez, 53, arrived in the United States in 2000 and applied for TPS after the 2001 earthquakes. She has lived in North Carolina for 18 years and runs a subcontracting construction business with her Honduran husband. The couple have two U.S.-born teenage sons. “This is a real blow for everyone,” said Hernandez by telephone. “Most of us pay taxes, we’re not living off the government, we’re not criminals.” The family will move to Honduras with their children and the couple do not intend to return north, she said, though they worry about violence and political instability in central America. Trump administration changes to the TPS program mean that over the next two years approximately 250,000 people who previously had permission to live and work in the United States will be subject to deportation if they remain. Haitians and Nicaraguans will lose their protected status in 2019 and Hondurans, the second largest group in the program, could lose their rights later this year. “The past practice of allowing foreign nationals to remain in the United States long after an initial emergency in their home countries has ended has undermined the integrity of the program and essentially made the ‘temporary’ protected status a front operation for backdoor permanent immigration,” said Roy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, which favors less immigration overall. VIOLENCE IN EL SALVADOR
Advocates of the program say long-term resident Salvadorans and their children should not be sent back to El Salvador, a country struggling with a weak economy and gang violence that has given it one of the world’s highest murder rates. “Our (U.S) government is complicit in breaking up families — nearly 275,000 U.S.-born children have a parent who is a TPS holder — and further destabilizing our neighboring countries,” said Oscar Chacon, executive director of Alianza Americas, an immigrant advocacy group. There are approximately 1.35 million Salvadorans of any status living in the United States, according to U.S. Census Bureau data analyzed by the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think tank. A senior administration official briefing reporters on the decision said it was based on the status of El Salvador’s recovery from the 2001 earthquakes. The country has received millions of dollars in aid and rebuilt schools, homes and hospitals, the official said. In the past two years, the United States has repatriated 39,000 Salvadorans, showing the ability of El Salvador to absorb an influx, the official said. The government of El Salvador said on Monday that it was glad the administration decided to at least leave the program in place until September 2019. “El Salvador’s Foreign Ministry lobbied heavily for the interests of our fellow citizens,” the government said in a statement, adding that it would continue to search for alternatives and seek action by the U.S. Congress to protect the migrants. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce had urged the government to extend TPS protections for Salvadorans, Haitians and Hondurans, saying “the loss of employment authorization for these populations would adversely impact several key industries,” including “construction, food processing, hospitality, and home healthcare services.” Congressional Democrats on Monday expressed support for finding a permanent solution to help Salvadorans in the United States. But that will be politically difficult at a time when there are rival immigration priorities, including providing permanent protection for “Dreamers” - undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. That effort has been weighed down by demands from conservatives in Congress to couple any such move with new efforts to clamp down on illegal immigration, especially from Mexico and Central America.",0
768,"President Trump pushed the wall while Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer hit the ceiling.
That’s the short version of the dueling prime time television addresses.
The Democratic arguments for obstructing President Trump rather than the growing flood of migrants don’t stand up to scrutiny.
Let’s go through them one by one.
When Democrats say walls don’t work, they must be having a flashback on the Blue Wall that was supposed to protect Hillary in 2016, the one that Donald J. Trump breached in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio.
That as we know didn’t work at all.
But Nancy Pelosi says she wants another virtual wall. She says she’ll fund new technology and innovation. But a virtual wall won’t work any better on the southern border than the blue wall did around the Great Lakes.
Our source on this is that notorious alt-right publication, the Washington Post. The kooks at the Post report that the government’s attempt in 2006 to build 28 miles of a high-tech virtual border wall known as SBInet, Secure Border Initiative Net, using sensors, radar and cameras failed miserably.
In all fairness, SBInet did succeed in transferring a billion tax dollars to a defense contractor whose employees gave generously to Democratic candidates this last cycle.
The Government Accountability Office declared, “Had the money spent on SBInet been spent instead on building a wall on the border, it could have covered 73 miles.”
It’s not like the Democrats don’t know about this. Former Democratic Rep. Dave Obey of Wisconsin helped expose the high-tech border wall boondoggle when he chaired the appropriations committee the last time Nancy Pelosi was speaker.
But instead of relying on the record, the facts and her failing memory, Nancy Pelosi stubbornly clings to the fantasy of a Star Wars force field at the border.
Nancy and Chuck kept saying the wall is ineffective wasteful and unnecessary. Which may be the first time in history Democrats worried about wasting taxpayers’ money. Then-Speaker Pelosi didn’t ask Boeing to give taxpayers back the $1 billion wasted on the virtual border wall that never worked.
Rep. Jerold Nadler, the new chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said nothing after we gave somewhere between $50 billion to $150 billion, including $1.7 billion in cash, to Iran following his vote to approve the Iran nuclear deal.
When it comes to effectiveness, real, as opposed to virtual, walls have a pretty good record despite what the anti-wall dead-enders want us to believe. I direct your attention to any number of embassies, consulates (including one in Benghazi), federal buildings and private homes, including President Obama’s, that have walls.
One reason we’re supposed to believe walls don’t work is — get ready for this — they are old, really old! This is, like, so age-ist! I mean, Chuck Schumer is old, but he works. Sometimes I wish he didn’t, but it’s not because he’s old.
I understand some Americans have a cult-like belief that anything new is automatically better. That’s why we buy the latest smartphone and will tell Alexa to turn the microwave on even though she may be reporting everything we say to Jeff Bezos. Call me old fashioned, but I know my stockade fence does a great job keeping people off my lawn, and the law requires me to have a fence around my pool to keep kids from drowning.
Then there’s the appeal to morality. Nancy says a wall doesn’t honor our values and declares it is “an immorality.” This is coming from the same person who doesn’t want government lecturing us about the morality of what her constituents are doing on the streets and between the sheets in San Francisco.
If I want a lecture on morality, I’ll call my preacher, not a member of Congress. We can debate whether the pope is infallible on matters of faith and morals, but there’s no question politicians aren’t. These are the same folks best remembered for hiding cash in the freezer, taking bribes in FBI sting operations and selling their votes and influence to the highest bidder.
Politicians are best known for being all talk and no action, and Chuck Schumer is all in on that count.
He said we can re-open the government and continue the debate over border security — for another 30 years!
The Democrats hit the wall with their arguments. And they were stopped.",1
831,"U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials closed the San Ysidro port of entry in the wake of several hundred migrants who tried to storm the border between Tijuana, Mexico and the San Diego area on Sunday afternoon.

President Trump earlier Sunday called for Mexico to stop oncoming caravans long before they get to the United States border, blaming the problem on Democrats in a Sunday tweet.
“Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border, or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U.S. No longer),” Trump tweeted. “Dems created this problem. No crossings!”",1
519,"The second-ranking Democratic leader in the House is resisting pressure from amnesty advocates to threaten another 2018 budget shutdown.
The leadership resistance will likely keep the illegals’ push for a DACA amnesty demand disconnected from the budget. That disconnect will likely boost President Donald Trump’s chance of getting $1.6 million for border-wall construction in the 2018 omnibus bill, due by March 23.
TheHill.com reported:
“I think the omnibus needs to be considered on its own merits, and then we ought to move ahead on DACA,” [leader Rep. Steny] Hoyer told reporters during his weekly press briefing in the Capitol, referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. That strategy would mark a shift from last month, when Hoyer, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic leaders had rejected a bipartisan budget agreement because it was not accompanied by a specific commitment from Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to consider legislation salvaging DACA, which President Trump is trying to wind down. The strategy also runs the risk of angering the immigrant rights activists pressing Democrats to use every tool they’ve got to solidify DACA protections … Congress has until March 23 to pass the omnibus spending bill or large parts of the federal government will shut down. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told the GOP conference Tuesday that he’s eyeing a House vote on the package next week — a timeline Hoyer endorsed.
Senate Democrats lost political support during their mid-January filibuster of the federal budget.
The House’s 2018 appropriations bill includes $1.6 billion for the budget wall. A Senate committee has approved a similar amount, but Senate Democrats have not yet approved the funding.
Senate Democrats may try to block the wall funding but would risk another damaging budget shutdown eight months before the 2018 midterms.
The $1.6 billion for 2018 is a different post of money from the $25 billion border-wall fund that Trump has asked Congress to approve. The $1.6 billion should be enough to construct and improve 74 miles of wall, while the $25 billion would fund roughly 700 miles.",1
2647,"The first year of Donald Trump’s unorthodox presidency may have been a dizzying ride, but Belinda Miller has never regretted voting for him in 2016.
“My 401(k) and my 403 have soared, and if anybody doesn’t realize that, they’ve been asleep for a year,” said Miller, a 50-year-old emergency room nurse from Audubon, Pennsylvania, referring to her retirement accounts’ growth in a booming stock market.
“I look overall not at what he says but what he does. All that other stuff is just rhetoric, smoke and mirrors,” she added.
The Philadelphia suburb where Miller lives in Montgomery County was key to Trump’s surprising 2016 triumph. In a sign of its importance, his campaign dispatched his daughter Ivanka to the region late in the race to woo women there.
In interviews with more than half a dozen Trump supporters in the region, mostly women, his backers remained largely committed to him, citing his immigration policies and a belief that tax reform will create jobs amid a growing economy. Many of them were unfazed by Trump’s combative style and provocative language.
Trump’s strength among his base is reflected in OutletName/Ipsos polls of Trump’s approval ratings, which show his support among Republicans has slipped only slightly over the year, dropping from 84 percent in his first month to 78 percent in the last month.
Carol Markowicz, a 52-year-old Philadelphia resident, said she voted for former Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012 but cast her ballot for Trump, convinced his business background and anti-illegal immigration stance would secure more jobs for Pennsylvanians.
“I really think they need to build a wall,” she said of Trump’s proposed Mexican border barrier. “I think they need to send back all these people that aren’t supposed to be here, because they’re taking jobs from Americans.”
Other Trump voters have grappled with how to evaluate the president’s policy accomplishments, like the sweeping tax law Republicans passed in December, amid his inflammatory words.
Some, like Miller and Loida Hopkins, a stay-at-home mother in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, said they focus on his actions, not his language.
“Let’s set aside his personality. What about what he’s actually doing that is benefiting us?” Hopkins said.On paper, Hopkins seems a likely Democratic target: Daughter of two illegal immigrants, she collects food stamps, suffers from enormous debt and voted for Obama in 2012.
But the devout Christian said she voted in part for Trump because of his opposition to abortion and believes that God put him in the White House for a reason.
She also said she was working hard to better herself, unlike other welfare recipients, and did not object that wealthy people and corporations stood to benefit from the tax law. Her husband, she said, is receiving a bonus from his company as a result.
TRUMP TWEETS HAVE ‘REPERCUSSIONS’Not all Trump voters are sticking with him. Kathleen Kuffel, 74, another Philadelphia suburban resident and a diehard Republican, said she reluctantly voted for Trump due to her distrust of Democrat Hillary Clinton.
But his behavior has dashed her hopes that he would act more “presidential” in office.
“He has some good ideas. Our tax code needs to be revamped, and I agree with some of his policies on immigration,” she said. “But he needs to learn diplomacy. He needs to learn he is not the only person in the world, and he needs to stop being selfish. He needs to consider that every time he tweets, it’s having huge repercussions.”
Polling data suggest the recent national debate about sexual abuse by powerful men has done little damage to Trump’s standing among Republican women, despite allegations of misconduct from more than a dozen women, all of which Trump has vehemently denied. Most of the women who spoke with OutletName said they did not believe the allegations.
Democrats running in 2018 face the same dilemma voters do: whether to focus on Trump’s behavior or his policies. Mark Nevins, a Philadelphia-based Democratic consultant, said he would advise candidates to campaign on pocketbook issues, like arguing that the tax bill increases the deficit while raising taxes on the middle class.
“There are people who just want to know: Who is going to make my life better?” he said.
But that argument may not sway Trump voters like Belinda Miller and her husband, John, a contractor, especially given the low unemployment rate and the still-growing economy.
“Have you ever gotten a job from a poor person?” John Miller said. “Poor people don’t hire workers. The corporations just needed a break in taxes so they can operate properly.”",0
602,"The Center For American Progress (CAP) Action Fund circulated a memo on Monday calling illegal immigrants brought here at a young age — so-called “Dreamers” — a “critical component of the Democratic Party’s future electoral success.” The memo, co-authored by former Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri, was sent around to allies calling on Democrats to “refuse to offer any votes for Republican spending bills that do not offer a fix for Dreamers and instead appropriate funds to deport them.” President Donald Trump’s administration moved to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy in September, which former President Barack Obama instituted through executive order to keep immigrants who came here as children from being deported. Trump called on Congress to find a legislative fix for young immigrants, or “Dreamers,” facing deportation. House lawmakers recently put forward a bipartisan DACA compromise bill that also claims to address worries over chain migration. However, it’s unclear if the bill will pass. CAP Action’s memo says protecting DACA is not only a “moral imperative” for Democrats, it also key to getting votes. “The fight to protect Dreamers is not only a moral imperative, it is also a critical component of the Democratic Party’s future electoral success,” reads Palmieri’s memo, obtained by OutletName News Foundation. “If Democrats don’t try to do everything in their power to defend Dreamers, that will jeopardize Democrats’ electoral chances in 2018 and beyond,” reads the memo. “In short, the next few weeks will tell us a lot about the Democratic Party and its long-term electoral prospects.” OutletName Host Tucker Carlson confronted Center for American Progress senior fellow Henry Fernandez on the memo. CAP Action is the 501(c)(4) political group, a sister group of the think tank where Fernandez is technically employed.",1

I found some steel slats down on the border. But I don’t see anything resembling a national emergency situation.. at least not in the McAllen TX area of the border where Trump will be today.

Er, you found a place where there is a barrier and all is quiet? Jim, do you know what point you’re actually making here? 
Jim Acosta just posted one of the biggest self owns ever.

Acosta also tagged the video location as filmed at a Burger King, which he explained in a subsequent tweet. “The Burger King is literally down hill from where we shot this (for folks who are wondering – why it shows up)” The Trump border visit comes amid a partial government shutdown over funding for border security, as Democratic congressional leaders refuse to give the White House its requested funding for a border wall.",1
1316,"A partisan clash over President Donald Trump’s border wall is heightening chances of a government shutdown next weekend as members of the Trump administration and congressional Democrats drew sharp lines in the sand on Sunday. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, speaking on OutletName’s “Face the Nation,” said it is likely that Mr. Trump will insist on including money to fund a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico in a bill this week to fund the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year. “He will do the right thing, for sure, but I suspect he will be insistent on the funding,” Mr. Kelly said. White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney underscored the importance of including money for the Mexican wall in the bill, a sentiment that Mr. Mulvaney also expressed in an interview with OutletName on Friday. “It’s not like we’re inserting something that the president didn’t talk about on the campaign,” Mr. Mulvaney told the Journal Friday. “It should come as a surprise to no one that President Trump wants money for a Southern border wall.” Democrats on Sunday said that insisting on the border wall funding could be a mistake. Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, a senior Democrat, called the funding “a political stunt” that could threaten the ability of Congress to approve a must-pass bill this week to keep the government open. Mr. Durbin said his message to the president is: “Don’t try any political stunts... don’t put any poison pills into the process.” In his interview with the Journal, Mr. Mulvaney said “elections have to have consequences” and, like former President Barack Obama, Mr. Trump is “entitled to have some of his priorities funded.” He added: “I don’t  think it’s an exaggeration to say that the wall is one of his top if not his top priority. He wants to get it built.”",0
1481,"President Trump’s expected selection of a successor to acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan this week is likely to provide a new direction for the agency chiefly responsible for carrying out immigration policy, but a pick could also run into legal hurdles. Ken Cuccinelli, acting head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, are the top two internal candidates for the job of acting DHS secretary, though a final decision hasn’t yet been made, people familiar with the matter said. The selection of either could immediately result in court challenges. A senior administration official said the list of candidates could expand. A White House spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Unlike Mr. McAleenan, who delivered his letter of resignation Friday after months of divergence with Mr. Trump on policy, Messrs. Cuccinelli and Morgan both defend Mr. Trump in forceful terms that echo the president’s. Conservative outside groups back the two contenders, in contrast to Mr. McAleenan, who was criticized publicly for a perceived lack of loyalty to the president. “The rhetoric coming from the top of DHS will likely now more closely match the president,” said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a nonprofit that supports liberalized immigration legislation. Mr. Cuccinelli and Mr. Morgan declined to comment. Though the agency has a broad mandate to protect the nation against terrorism, cyberattacks, natural disasters and other threats, immigration has defined the secretary’s role for the four Trump appointees who have served in the position, and played a part in their respective departures. Messrs. Cuccinelli and Morgan were installed in the spring after the White House pushed out several officials, including former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who they felt were standing in the way of tougher immigration enforcement. Mr. Morgan has pushed to increase deportations of families and children, a priority for conservatives who believe the immigration surge is a national-security concern and that deportations are the most effective deterrent. Mr. Cuccinelli has argued that his experience as Virginia’s attorney general from 2010 to 2014 qualifies him to craft policies that can withstand court challenges. Mr. Cuccinelli has also shown a desire to advocate for policies that go beyond his own agency’s purview, which includes asylum, refugees and immigration benefits like visas and green cards. In recent months, he has traveled to the border and he frequently tweets about sanctuary cities, U.S. jurisdictions that decline to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A group of conservative organizations, including the Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and the Alliance Defending Freedom, signed a letter of support for Mr. Cuccinelli on Monday. “He has become the point man for the administration’s immigration policies already,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that supports strict immigration controls. It isn’t yet known whether Mr. Trump plans to nominate someone to hold the post permanently, a step that would require confirmation by the Senate. Administration officials have also discussed tapping an outside candidate as acting secretary, though doing so would face even more legal hurdles. White House officials privately acknowledge that Mr. Cuccinelli likely wouldn’t win confirmation. Mr. Cuccinelli made powerful enemies in the chamber, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), when he ran the Senate Conservatives Fund, an outside group that challenged incumbent Republicans. When Mr. Cuccinelli’s name was first floated for the position this year, Mr. McConnell noted a “lack of enthusiasm” in the Senate. Mr. Trump has found that appointing acting leaders to oversee immigration has worked to his advantage—eliminating congressional support as a factor and tying their fates more directly to White House desires. “I sort of like ‘acting,’” Mr. Trump said earlier this year. “It gives me more flexibility.” Still, the senior administration official said the timing of Mr. McAleenan’s resignation surprised many White House officials, who expected him to step down, but didn’t know exactly when he would do so. The number of DHS officials qualified to be nominated is small, as most of the department’s leaders, including the deputy secretary, serve only in acting capacities because they haven’t been confirmed by the Senate. The highest-ranking official confirmed by the Senate is David Pekoske, administrator of the Transportation Security Administration and currently acting deputy DHS secretary. He has less of a background in immigration issues than Messrs. Cuccinelli and Morgan, but his elevation would be the safest legal choice under laws governing acting leadership. Mr. Pekoske didn’t respond to a request for comment. The leaders of the three primary immigration agencies at DHS—Customs and Border Protection, Citizenship and Immigration Services and ICE—are all headed by acting officials, the first such lineup in the agency’s 16-year history. A selection of Mr. Cuccinelli or Mr. Morgan would likely invite immediate legal challenges. Acting officials in cabinet-level positions must either be next in line for a position or hold a Senate-confirmed position, according to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, which also states that acting officials can serve for no longer than 210 days starting on the date the vacancy occurs. Neither man has those qualifications. White House officials are hoping that either candidate would qualify under a provision of the statute that says an agency official who has served for at least 90 days in the past year can also be elevated, according to one person familiar with their thinking. Appointing either Mr. Cuccinelli or Mr. Morgan would present an additional risk: Legal experts say any policy they adopt could be challenged on the grounds that, as acting leaders whose appointments were made with unconventional applications of the statute, they don’t have the legal authority to carry it out. “It certainly provides an avenue for people to challenge the policies they put in place,” said David Lapan, a former DHS spokesman. One other option White House officials are weighing is creating a “border czar” position to coordinate the three immigration agencies’ work. Mr. Trump floated a similar idea in the spring and suggested Mr. Cuccinelli or former acting ICE director Tom Homan as possibilities, though he didn’t create the post. The position wouldn’t require Senate confirmation, and the officeholder could stay indefinitely. The creation of a post that outranks Senate-approved leaders and is exempt from such qualification, however, would almost certainly prompt court challenges.",0
1300,"Legislation to speed up the process for employment-based green cards for some Indian immigrants caught in a yearslong backlog could receive a vote in the Senate as early as this week, after the bill’s sponsor and a key objector reached a bipartisan compromise. The bill would lift per-country caps on permanent residency for immigrants who have job offers in the U.S. That would allow people who have waited in the backlog the longest—primarily Indian and some Chinese immigrants on H-1B high-skill visas—to receive green cards first under a new system. A version of the bill passed with a wide bipartisan majority in the House in July, and Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah) has brought up his version in the Senate multiple times through a process known as unanimous consent, which allows bills to bypass roll-call votes. But Mr. Lee’s bill has drawn objections from one or more senators each time it was introduced. Mr. Lee reached a compromise with one of the bill’s longest holdouts, Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), Senate aides said Tuesday night, reviving its chances of receiving a vote. Under current U.S. law, no more than 7% of employment-based green cards can be issued to any one country, though in practice countries including India receive more because the leftover visas are reallocated to meet demand. Critics of that approach in both parties say allotting the same number of green cards to each country gives an advantage to those applying from smaller nations while penalizing Indian and Chinese applicants who qualify but must wait years for their turn because they are in larger pools of applicants. The problem stems in part from the fact that U.S. approvals of green-card applicants vastly exceed the number of available employment-based green cards that are actually distributed, which total about 140,000 annually. While there are no limits to how many applicants can be approved, there is a fixed overall number of green cards issued by the State Department. Mr. Lee’s bill wouldn’t change the overall number of green cards allocated each year, but would allow people who have waited longest in the queue for permanent residency to get green cards first. Mr. Durbin has previously called for allowing immigrants waiting in the backlog to have greater freedom to travel and switch jobs. He has also previously worried that the bill’s immediate switch to a system without any per-country caps would harm applicants who are not Indian. Under the agreement he struck with Mr. Lee, the per-country cap system would phase out over a decade, allowing a small percentage to be set aside for applicants who aren’t from India and China, Senate aides said. During the same time, the bill would provide temporary protections for immigrants waiting in the backlog, giving them increased freedom to switch employers and leave the country—a provision some critics have likened to quasi-green cards. The latest version of the bill also attaches several new restrictions to the H-1B high-skilled visa program. Companies whose workforce is at 50% on H-1B or L1 visas—which are for intracompany transfers—wouldn’t be permitted to hire any more foreign workers, effectively setting the domestic foreign workforce cap at 50%. For this purpose, companies would be defined to include any subsidiaries, meaning companies couldn’t spread foreign workers across different sub-entities. The provision is designed primarily to target Indian outsourcing firms, whose U.S. workforces routinely exceed 50% foreign workers. It isn’t clear whether the newly added provisions could raise objections from other senators, any one of whom could prevent the bill from passing.""A combination of fences and walls along the entire southern border with Mexico would cost more than $20.6 billion to construct with additional maintenance expenses, according to internal Department of Homeland Security estimates. The report makes clear that the wall President Donald Trump promised during his campaign would be considerably more expensive than the fencing favored by most border-control experts. A new fence would cost about $9.3 million per mile, while a wall would cost $17.8 million per mile, according to the report. The report reviewed by OutletName suggests the administration is planning a combination of walls and fences along the nearly 2,000-mile border. A Homeland Security spokeswoman declined to comment. “As a matter of policy, we do not comment on or confirm the potential existence of pre-decisional, deliberative documents,” she said. The price tag outlined is well above the $12 billion to $15 billion package GOP congressional leaders said they were expecting the Trump administration to request. It is unclear if Congress will be willing to appropriate that much, not to mention additional funding the Trump administration wants to hire 5,000 more border-patrol agents and another 10,000 enforcement officers and to build new detention centers to hold people who cross the border without authorization. Mr. Trump has promised Mexico will reimburse the U.S. for the wall costs, but Mexico has said it won’t pay, and even many Republicans in Congress say the project would have to be funded by U.S. taxpayers. It is unclear whether lawmakers will offset it with cuts to spending elsewhere or tax increases, or whether they will add the new spending to the deficit. The report calls for the project to unfold in stages. It details specific, modest goals for the early phases and large, unspecified mandates later. The first phase calls for 14 new miles of fencing in San Diego, Calif., and El Paso, Texas, and 12 miles in the Rio Grande Valley area of Texas. The next phase contemplates 151 miles of new fencing somewhere along the border without specifying where, followed by 272 miles of replacement fencing and then 118 miles of double fencing, where a second layer would be added to areas where a single fence already exists. After that, the report suggests another 1,080 miles of barriers would be built, for a total of 1,257 additional miles of total fencing and walls. That is on top of just over 650 miles of fence in place today. If that were accomplished, the new and old fences would run along almost the entire border with Mexico, as Mr. Trump has promised. A timetable included in the report assumes funding from Congress comes through by this spring and that construction begins in the fall. It projects the first phase would be complete in 2021. The internal estimates were first reported by OutletName. People familiar with the planning said the first phase of the project was easily achievable and could be enough to Mr. Trump to declare a political victory. The report lists several potential obstacles to construction of walls and fencing along the full border, including the need to acquire privately held land and requirements of the International Boundary and Water Commission, a U.S.-Mexican agency that must approve changes that could impact the Rio Grande River. In Texas, the river is the border between the two countries. The DHS report says that in 2008, it had projected it would cost $11 million per mile for fencing in Hidalgo, Texas, but that adaptations needs to deal with a flood plain and to meet the commission’s requirements drove the price to $15 million per mile. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump projected confidence about the project as he told a law-enforcement conference he would help Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly stop drugs from coming into the U.S. “We will give him a wall, and it will be a real wall,” Mr. Trump said. He said the wall is ”being designed right now” and dismissed speculation was joking about building it. “I don’t kid,” Mr. Trump said.""",0
806,"Immigration hawks think that Democrats might support lowering legal immigration in return for a permanent amnesty for illegal aliens who arrived in the U.S. as minors, OutletName has learned.
The Trump administration has put its full force behind the RAISE Act, with both President Trump and his cabinet secretaries praising the legislation. The bill, which is sponsored by Republican senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, aims to decrease legal immigration from around 1 million annually to roughly 500,000 a year.
Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, wrote in National Review that a way for the RAISE Act to get 60 votes in the Senate would be for it to include amnesty for the 800,000 or so beneficiaries of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).
DACA is the program started by President Obama in 2012 that protects illegal immigrants who arrived as minors from deportation and gives them work permits.
Ten Republican state attorneys general have threatened to sue the federal government if the program isn’t ended by September, and the Trump administration could refuse to defend the program much like the Obama administration did with the Defense of Marriage Act.
Krikorian went on WMAL Thursday morning and told OutletName’s Vince Coglianese, “Now there is a real possibility the plug will be pulled on that program [DACA] and so the Democrats are willing to trade a stable lawful amnesty to replace Obama’s illegal measure in exchange for the bill which was introduce yesterday.”
TheDC was also told by a source in a think tank that supports reducing immigration that he suspects that a form of legislative amnesty will be passed in return for passage of the RAISE Act.
President Trump promised to immediately terminate DACA while on the campaign trail, but has yet to do so. Roughly 100,000 illegal immigrants have benefited from the program in his first few months in office.
The White House has continued to say that the program’s future is under review.",1
2563,"President Donald Trump and senior Democrats failed to strike a deal in talks on Friday to end a partial shutdown of the U.S. government as they again fought over Trump’s request for $5 billion to fund his signature wall on the Mexican border.
After Democratic congressional leaders turned Trump down at a meeting in the White House Situation Room, the Republican president threatened to take the controversial step of using emergency powers to build the wall without approval from Congress.
Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall and as a result about 800,000 federal workers have been unpaid due to the closure of about a quarter of the federal government.
Administration officials, led by Vice President Mike Pence, and congressional staffers are to meet during the weekend to try to end the impasse over the 2-week-old shutdown.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown. “He resisted,” Schumer said. “In fact, he said he’d keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.”
Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday.
“We had a very, very productive meeting, and we’ve come a long way,” Trump said.
But raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.
Asked by a reporter whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: “Yes, I have ... I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.”
He said he could declare a national emergency “because of the security of our country, absolutely.”
The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government so Trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having Mexico pay for it - was one of Trump’s main promises when he ran for president in 2016.
Trump’s wall project is estimated to cost about $23 billion.
Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval.
Nancy Pelosi, the newly elected Democratic speaker of the House, said Friday’s meeting with Trump was “sometimes contentious” but that they agreed to continue talking.
“But we recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,” she said.
Credit rating agency Moody’s says the shutdown will cause minimal U.S. economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.
A OutletName/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blame Trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blame Republican lawmakers, against 32 percent who blame Democrats.
In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said he would be “proud” to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible.The partial shutdown is straining the country’s immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

2317,"My family has lived along the Rio Grande for five generations. As we could tell the president if he asked, there is no need for a wall across our land.
My backyard is on the border. To me, “build that wall” is not a slogan. To me, the fight over a border wall is not an abstract argument about politics. To me — and to my family and neighbors — construction of a border wall is personal.
My family has lived on land along the Rio Grande in Starr County, Texas, for at least five generations. I have lived on this land for more than 40 years; my father lives next to me, alongside the land where my grandfather lived. We still use a wooden corral built by my great-grandfather for keeping farm animals. My grandchild and nieces and nephews play in the same places where their parents and grandparents played.
In all my time here, I have never seen an “invasion” of criminals or drug traffickers or gang members rushing across the border, as the president described in a press conference. In fact, I can’t remember ever seeing a migrant cross the river from Mexico and come across my family’s property. To do so, someone would have to climb up the soft bluff that runs alongside the river at the end of my property. The natural barrier of the river and the bluff makes my family’s property unattractive as a crossing place.
Trump's border wall won't solve addiction crisis — but finally targeting big pharma can
An illegal immigrant killed my daughter. Trump's right — we must complete the border wall.
As an undocumented worker, I cleaned Trump's golf club. Now, I'm a voice for all immigrants.
As my family and neighbors can tell you, and could tell the president if he asked, there is no invasion in the Rio Grande Valley, no emergency here, no need for a wall across our land.
Trump's unfair, unlawful emergency declaration
Because Congress would not appropriate the amount of funds the president wants to build a border wall, he declared a national emergency on our southern border to try to free up billions of dollars to build a wall.
The president circumventing Congress is unlawful, as my lawyers at Public Citizen have explained in a legal challenge filed against the president on the same day he issued his emergency declaration. While my lawyers will argue the legalities of the president’s action, the bottom line for me is that the federal government is threatening to take my land to fulfill a campaign promise but without any need.

I have received letters from the U.S. government stating that the government is going to take me to court to gain access to my property and build a border wall across my land. The maps they sent me show a wall and a maintenance road to be constructed just a few feet from the back of my house. They describe a 150-foot wide enforcement zone and a 25-foot wide road between my house and the river — but the river is only 200 feet from my house, and the land closest to the river is unstable and subject to erosion.
In January, I called a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers realty specialist to ask how they could possibly fit the border wall and enforcement zone between my house and the river. They told me that they were going to build the wall even if they had to squeeze it in.
Even if my house itself is spared, it will never be the same. I will lose my entire backyard, and I will be staring at a wall right outside my back door and windows. My family’s property next door, where we enjoy family gatherings and the ranching lifestyle, will be divided by the wall, with about two-thirds of the land on the south side of the wall.
I live on a peaceful stretch of property along the river in South Texas, in the United States of America. To me, “build that wall” is not simply a slogan; instead, it is a threat to my way of life, my liberty, and my property.
There is no need for a wall across my and my family’s property.
No emergency exists here.

453,"Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents stopped two previously deported sex offenders from successfully making their way back into the U.S. — one a child molester, the second, a rapist.
In separate incidents, Del Rio Sector agents apprehended two previously deported criminal aliens as they attempted to make their way back into the U.S. interior. Officials reported that agents assigned to the Carrizo Springs Station arrested a 53-year-old Mexican national on January 24 for illegally crossing the border. Agents transported the migrant to the station for processing where they discovered his criminal and immigration history, according to information obtained from Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials.
All migrants arrested by Border Patrol agents undergo a biometric background check to search for prior criminal history, gang affiliation, or immigration violations. In this case, records revealed that a court in Decatur, Illinois, convicted the Mexican national in 2012 for child molestation. The court sentenced the migrant to 10 years in state prison. Immigration officers deported the man in April 2017 after he served five years of the sentence.
Three days later, Brackettville Station agents arrested a 48-year-old Mexican national for illegal entry into the U.S., officials stated. During a background investigation, the agents learned that a court in La Grange, Kentucky, convicted the man in 1996 for rape. Immigration officers deported the criminal alien after he served two years of a five-year prison sentence, officials reported.
“Apprehensions like these highlight our commitment to the safety and security of our communities,” Del Rio Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent Matthew J. Hudak said in a written statement. “Our agents work diligently every day to prevent dangerous individuals, like these two sex offenders, from entering our the county.”
Both migrants now face federal felony charges for illegal re-entry after removal as a sex offender. If convicted, the men could each face prison sentences of up to 20 years.

2410,"Attorneys for a Mexican immigrant in Seattle, who has permission to work in the United States, are hoping to convince a federal judge to hear a challenge to his immigration arrest and bypass U.S. immigration courts. If they are successful on Wednesday, the case of Daniel Ramirez Medina, a so-called dreamer afforded some protection from deportation under an Obama-era program, could point a new way forward for thousands of people across the country threatened by stepped-up immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump. Under U.S. law, deportation cases must be heard by immigration courts but Ramirez hopes to establish an alternate legal challenge over his arrest. Immigration courts, which operate separately from the broader federal judiciary, have a huge backlog and immigration lawyers say it is difficult to win deportation challenges in them. By contesting what they say was Ramirez’s unconstitutional arrest rather than his deportation action, his lawyers hope to have the case heard in the federal court system rather than in immigration court. However, questions from the Seattle federal judge ahead of the hearing suggest Ramirez’s lawyers could face an uphill battle. The case could be the first under the Trump administration in which a person granted a work permit under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) has been taken into immigration custody, Ramirez’s lawyers say. The Obama-era program offers protection from deportation for some 750,000 immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. These people are sometimes called “dreamers,” in reference to the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) legislation that failed to pass Congress. Ramirez was arrested in February by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers who went to his house to arrest his father. ICE alleged Ramirez had gang ties and should be deported. Ramirez’s lawyers have denied their client has any gang involvement or criminal record. Justice Department lawyers said in their filings that immigration court is the only appropriate venue for challenging deportation-related issues. They pointed to a ruling last year from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said federal courts did not have jurisdiction to hear a class action brought by children claiming the right to legal representation in immigration court. Because the case involved deportations, the 9th Circuit said it must be litigated in immigration court. Last week, U.S. Magistrate Judge James Donohue in Seattle signaled that he was taking the Justice Department’s argument seriously. Donohue posed several written questions to Ramirez’s lawyers about their legal arguments, and asked for a “more thorough discussion” of the 9th Circuit case. Lawyers for arrested individuals have long sought ways to avoid immigration court, but it is difficult, said Ira Kurzban, a Miami lawyer who has written books on immigration law. If Ramirez wins a clear ruling that ICE unconstitutionally arrested him, Kurzban said, it could open a path for other immigrants to try the same tactic. Ramirez’s lawyers said the 9th Circuit case does not involve arrests, so it should not weigh against their argument. They cited U.S. Supreme Court rulings that even prisoners at Guantanamo Bay have the right to challenge their detention in federal court. Donohue will hear arguments from both sides on Wednesday, and could rule from the bench on whether he has the power to hear Ramirez’s case.",0
1249,"Two private prison companies are facing legal pressure over work programs at detention centers that pay migrants $1 a day to perform tasks such as cleaning or working in the centers’ kitchens. Recent lawsuits have accused Geo Group Inc. and Co Inc. of violating federal laws prohibiting forced labor, state minimum-wage laws or unjust-enrichment laws. The companies run detention centers for migrants caught crossing the southern border, detained asking for asylum at an official entry place or accused of living in the U.S. illegally. Andrew Free, who represents several plaintiffs, said that while prisons can force people convicted of crimes to work, they can’t do the same to people who haven’t been. “The key distinction is because immigration detention is civil in nature,” said Mr. Free. “The people in these places cannot be made to work against their will.” The companies—the nation’s two largest private prison operators—say the longstanding work programs for migrants are voluntary and are sanctioned by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The $1-a-day rate for immigrant detainees was established by Congress decades ago. ICE’s detention standards say detainees may volunteer for such work to “earn money while confined” and that the resulting “decreased idleness” could ease the “negative impact of confinement.” CoreCivic spokesman Steve Owen said the company’s voluntary work programs “are consistent with similar programs at other ICE facilities—operated by both public and private entities—and that meet our contractual obligations.” Geo spokesman Pablo Paez pointed out that the voluntary work program and wage rates were set by the government. “As a service provider to the federal government, Geo is required to abide by these federally mandated standards and congressionally established guidelines,” he said. The legal challenges gained traction earlier this year when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit agreed with a lower-court ruling to allow nine immigrant detainees held at Geo Group’s 1,500-bed detention center in Aurora, Colo., to represent a class of about 60,000 others who have been held there in recent years. Geo Group is appealing the 10th Circuit decision to the Supreme Court. Geo’s attorneys have argued that the company is simply following ICE’s own policies on voluntary work. The Trump administration wants to detain more migrants who have crossed the southern border as it tries to crack down on immigration. The number of migrants in detention while awaiting immigration hearings or deportation has risen to a daily average of 40,000 this year from 34,000 two years ago. A group of 18 Republican congressman including California’s Rep. Dana Rohrabacher sent a letter to ICE earlier this year recommending that the agency step in to defend the private prison companies and offer new guidance on the work program to prevent such lawsuits. “The very goal of the advocates who file these lawsuits is to raise the overall costs of immigration detention in order to discourage its use and diminish the overall level of immigration enforcement in the United States,” the letter said. Meanwhile, Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, filed a lawsuit last fall against Geo Group over the $1-a-day work program at a detention center in Tacoma, alleging the company is violating the state’s minimum wage laws. Danielle Bennett, an ICE spokeswoman, said the agency had responded to the letter from the congressmen, but declined to provide the response. Under its detention standards, detainees may volunteer for work assignments but otherwise shouldn’t be required to work except for personal housekeeping, she said. She declined to comment on the litigation because ICE isn’t a party. Kevin Landy, former director of the Office of Detention Policy and Planning at ICE under the Obama administration, said private prison companies may pay more than a $1 a day under ICE’s detention standards. He said the low-wage labor keeps the contractors’ operating costs low. “They are profiting off of it,” said Mr. Landy. “To some extent detention facilities use detainee labor in place of paid employees doing their work.” According to court filings, Geo said that if it had to pay the detainees minimum wage, it would affect how much it would charge the government. In a suit filed in April, attorneys allege that Wilhen Barrientos, a Guatemalan man seeking asylum, was threatened with sanctions if he stopped working for $1 to $4 a day as a kitchen laborer at CoreCivic’s 2,000-bed detention center in Lumpkin, Ga. Mr. Owen, the CoreCivic spokesman, declined to comment on the case, but said that all work programs are voluntary and in compliance with rules for detainee labor. “We set and deliver the same high standard of care—including three daily meals, access to health care and other everyday living needs—regardless of whether a detainee participates in a voluntary work program,” Mr. Owen said. In the Aurora case, one detainee, Carlos Ortiz Muñoz, said in court filings that he was forced to clean for no pay while he was held there in 2014 and 2015. Those who refused to work were threatened with solitary confinement, the suit alleges. The suit also attacks the $1-a-day voluntary work program at Aurora for allegedly violating a Colorado law prohibiting unjust enrichment. At an annual shareholders meeting in April, Geo Chief Executive George Zoley said the lawsuits wouldn’t change the company’s procedures. “The $1-per-day payment for immigration detention detainees was established by Congress and is stipulated in our contracts,” said Mr. Zoley. Unless a change is made, “we will continue to pay the stipulated amount of $1 per day.”",0
625,"Some federal judges handling immigration-related cases are balking at delaying court proceedings during the government shutdown. Such judges are acting differently than courts did during 2013’s shutdown under President Obama.
In 2013, federal courts postponed cases involving Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys. During this shutdown, most federal courts are apparently doing likewise. Other judges with immigration-related or Trump-centered cases, however, are requiring DOJ attorneys to work pending litigation.
Such judges ignore the Constitution’s limits on their authority. Federal courts, as classically explained in Federalist #78, “have neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment.”
As devotees of the progressive movement, however, many judges reject the Constitution’s structure of separation of powers. Some really believe federal courts should be the most powerful branch of government. They are rightly called “judicial supremacists.”
Supremacist judges have been over-reaching their authority with impunity for many years. They push the limits like speculators who believe stock or real-estate markets will never crash. As Federalist #78 cautions, federal courts must “ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.”
Americans’ respect for courts and the rule of law results in court judgments being routinely implemented. But when a party refuses to comply with a judgment, who enforces it? Judges are powerless on their own. They must rely on U.S. Marshals.
Some federal judges consider U.S. Marshals to be court employees, but they’re not. Marshals are DOJ employees, with some assigned to federal courts. Thus, U.S. Marshals ultimately work for the president.
The Antideficiency Act (ADA), triggered in government shutdowns, illustrates separation-of-powers interplay among the branches. The ADA, Congress’s attempt to restrain executive spending, also applies to the courts. It bars officers and employees from obligating funds Congress has not appropriated. Thus, shutdowns force furloughing of non-essential employees.
In this shutdown, some judges are presuming to have power over executive branch decisions about who is and is not essential. Like the executive, courts decide who of their own employees are essential. Interfering in DOJ’s decisions about essential employees is political, not judicial, action.
To comply with these illegitimate orders, DOJ must either change or ignore its own shutdown plan. If DOJ’s “non-essential” lawyers appear in court, they would be acting as “volunteers.”
The ADA bars volunteering “except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.” The ADA provides that “the term ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property’ does not include ongoing, regular functions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property.”
“Knowing and willful” ADA violations constitute crimes.
Nevertheless, a judge hearing challenges to restrictions on asylum-seekers is insisting DOJ lawyers continue working. He claims his case involves” the safety of human life or the protection of property.” But his case doesn’t necessarily meet the ADA’s definition of “emergency.” The judge’s comments reflect his annoyance that 91 percent of Customs and Border Protection workers continue working.
This judge doesn’t disguise disagreement with President Trump’s judgments about safety. He sees asylum seekers; Trump sees invading aliens. The judge likely believes himself duty-bound to block Trump’s border policies. The Constitution, however, makes presidents primarily responsible for defending the country’s safety. Unlike initiating war, which requires a declaration by Congress, the president is obligated to defend the country against attacks and invasions — including by organized caravans.
Judicial Supremacists should reread Marbury v. Madison. Like Federalist 78, Marbury couples the independence of the federal judiciary with the separation-of-powers limits to its authority.
In Marbury, Chief Justice Marshall ruled the Court lacked jurisdiction to order a particular action against Jefferson’s Secretary of State. Marshall also realized that President Jefferson would never enforce any such order. Both sides understood that federal courts lack power and depend ultimately on the president enforcing court orders.
Like Presidents Jefferson, Jackson, and FDR, President Trump does not hesitate to criticize federal judges. Consider what President Trump could — but hopefully will not — do. U.S. Marshals are classified as essential. Some marshals have already been dispatched to the border. What would happen if the president directed more marshals to the border, including those assigned to federal courts? Unavoidably, without marshals for safety protection, courts would close. And federal judges could do nothing but complain.
The Constitution’s Separation of Powers ensures each branch has the ability to defend itself against the other two, ideally producing a peaceful equilibrium. Judicial supremacists distort that structure to favor the judiciary.
Every judge addicted to power should consider the hypothetical of an unpredictable president doing the unthinkable. Re-deploying court-assigned marshals during a shutdown would reveal the powerlessness of judges. It would also provide political leverage, otherwise lacking, against congressional Democrats. Such a hypothetical should remind everyone that the federal judiciary remains “the weakest branch.”",1
405,"Deportation of illegal immigrants hit a 10-year low during President Obama’s last full fiscal year in office. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also appeared to be cutting back on information provided about all three of its law enforcement agencies.
The administration waited until the last Friday of the year to release its final FY 2016 report on Immigration and Customs Enforcement removal operations.
“It’s no wonder that they waited for a day when hardly a soul was paying attention; the numbers for ICE are abysmal, even worse than 2015,” Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Studies Jessica Vaughn reported this week. If there were an award for government reports that aim to obfuscate and spin, I would nominate this one.”
Vaughn wrote that the annual reports have historically provided basic statistics from all three of the department’s law enforcement agencies. This year, the report sneaked out by DHS officials on the last working day of the month normally, in two versions, was scaled back to provide only a fraction of the information normally disclosed. The reported is compiled by the Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) which has a new director, Marc Rosenblum.
Vaughn listed the following as key findings from the annual report:
Deportations credited to ICE in 2016 increased by 2 percent. All of the increase came from cases of aliens arrested by the Border Patrol, not interior enforcement.
Interior deportations fell from 69,478 in 2015 to 65,322 in 2016, out of a population of illegal aliens now estimated at 12 million.
Deportations of criminal aliens fell from 63,127 in 2015 to 60,318 in 2016, out of an estimated population of two million.
The total number of deportations under the Obama administration is not easily comparable to prior administrations because of the number of border cases included, but it certainly is not record-breaking, as Obama has claimed.
DHS maintains that CBP arrests have always been a large share of ICE deportations, but in fact this is a new development under the Obama Administration. In prior administrations, only a third of deportations credited to ICE were border cases; now about two-thirds are.
One of the priorities of the Obama Administration was supposed to be deporting criminal aliens and others designated under the Priority Enforcement Program introduced in November 2014. OutletName Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby dubbed the program “Catch and Release 2.0” in an article published in January 2015.
“Before these changes,” a federal agent with U.S. Customs and Border Protection told OutletName Texas at the time, “all illegal aliens arrested by Border Patrol were required to enter the deportation system where they would be scheduled for a deportation hearing at a future date. Under this new system, the illegal aliens are not even required to show up for a hearing ever.”
“Not only are we releasing these people with no hearings scheduled, no notice to appear, but the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] is forcing Border Patrol to prepare the initial paperwork for the illegal aliens’ work permits.” The source added, “Americans really need to think about the terrorism-related implications of this. Illegal aliens who are suspected of having terrorism ties, but not convicted, could be permitted to stay in the country.”
The impact of the new program has been dramatic in a negative way. The charts below show the dramatic decline of interior deportations (called removals by the DHS) and the removal of criminal aliens from the U.S.:
Vaughn reported that 98 percent of all interior deportations were convicted criminals. This means that other migrants who have been crossing the border in massive numbers for the past several years are simply allowed to stay.
Even though the removal of criminal aliens made up nearly all of the interior deportations, the numbers of criminals being deported also continued to fall from previous years. This is not because the country is running out of criminal aliens to deport.
“The main reason for the decline is the Obama administration’s prioritization scheme that has steadily narrowed the types of cases that ICE officers are permitted to pursue.
The total number of removals (deportations and voluntary returns) increased by less than 5,000 in FY 2016 compared to FY 2015. However, the total deportation number of 240,000 aliens is 41 percent lower than the peak FY 2012 numbers.
“Obama has the lowest rate of deportations since the Nixon Administration,” Vaughn stated. “The administration and its allies frequently point out that more than two million removals have occurred since 2009, an accomplishment that they characterize as record-breaking.”
Vaughn explains why this is not true:
But counting only removals as deportations presents a misleading picture of the level of enforcement. Removals are just one form of the deportation process that can be executed by any of the three DHS enforcement agencies (ICE, Border Patrol, and CBP officers at the port of entry). All three enforcement agencies also can process deportable aliens as a return (sometimes known as voluntary return), which is a lesser consequence. In general most border deportations are processed as returns and most interior deportations are processed as removals, but in recent years many more aliens apprehended at the border have been turned over to ICE for a brief period of detention and then removed in recent years, in a departure from the traditional “you catch ’em, you clean ’em” policies, where the arresting agency typically handles the deportation process. In addition, illegal border-crossers who have been removed previously, or who are prosecuted for smuggling or other crimes are turned over to ICE for processing. Under these scenarios, the Border Patrol will count the case as an apprehension, which is their marquee enforcement metric, and ICE will count the case as a deportation. Under Obama, a much larger number of Border Patrol cases were transferred to ICE for processing than had been the case under prior administrations. In 2008, the last year of the George W. Bush administration, just over a third of deportations credited to ICE were border cases, and two-thirds were interior cases. In 2016, more than two-thirds of the deportation cases credited to ICE were border cases, and less than a third were interior cases.
Rather than using removals as the measurement, Vaughn suggests that a more “apples-to-apples” comparison can be made by examining interior deportations and border removals separately. “Neither the Border Patrol nor CBP publishes the total number of deportations executed, and many of the cases are transferred to ICE, so year-by-year comparisons of border deportations alone are impossible using open source statistics,” she stated.
Using these methods, Vaughn concluded that the Obama Administration has completed a total of 5.3 million deportations (both interior and border removals. That number represents about half of those same actions under the administration of then-President George W. Bush. It is not the Obama Administration that holds the record for deportations. Rather, it is the Clinton Administration record with 12.3 million deportations reported.
The following chart provided by the CIS reveals the average number of deportations reported annually:
Vaughn was extremely critical of the content of the new annual report released by first-year Director Rosenblum. ”The first set of reports prepared under the tenure of new OIS Director Marc Rosenblum, formerly of the Migration Policy Institute, are of dubious value,” she stated. She explained that the previous year’s reported provided numerous data tables and explanatory materials providing a more neutral view of actions taken by the department. Typically, those reports would provide data covering multiple years for comparison.
“The new reports include only one set of actual enforcement statistics with only five numbers drawn from DHS systems — repeat, five enforcement statistics,” Vaughn reported. “Specifically, OIS is reporting: the number of inadmissibility determinations at the port of entry; the number of Border Patrol apprehensions; the number of ICE arrests, the number of book-ins to detention, and the total number of deportations. No numbers are provided for prior years, but percentage changes from 2015 are reported.”
Vaughn concluded that the immigration issue will continue to be one of the most important and contentious policy matters facing the new President and his administration. “The incoming Trump administration and Congress must insist that DHS return to a relatively standardized and apolitical manner of publishing the vital statistics of the immigration agencies in order to support this discussion.”

509,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said Thursday that President Donald Trump will sign legislation to prevent a second partial government shutdown and declare a national emergency to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
“He’s prepared to sign the bill, he will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time,” McConnell said ahead of a Senate vote on a measure to keep the government running past the February 15 deadline.
The comprise measure keeps departments running through the fiscal year but without the $5.7 billion the president wanted for the border wall with Mexico.
Moments after McConnell’s remarks, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a statement that the president will sign the funding bill and take executive action to build the wall. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action – including a national emergency – to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border. The President is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country,” Sanders said.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Democrats “may” file a legal challenge if a national emergency is declared, saying she and other party leaders are reviewing their options. “I may, that’s an option. We will review our options,” she said when asked if Democrats will take legal action. “But it’s important to note that when the president declares this emergency, first of all, it’s not an emergency. What’s happening at the border is a humanitarian challenge to us. The president is trying to sell a bill of goods.”
Following Pelosi’s remarks, Sanders told reporters that the administration is “very prepared” for legal challenges, adding that “there shouldn’t be” any. “The president’s doing his job. Congress should do theirs,” she said.
The Democrat-controlled House is poised to pass the sweeping measure Thursday evening, and the Republican-led Senate is expected to approve as well. Bargainers formally completed the accord moments before midnight Wednesday night.
The product of nearly three weeks of talks, the agreement provides almost $1.4 billion for new barriers along the boundary. That’s less than the $1.6 billion for border security in a bipartisan Senate bill that President Trump spurned months ago, and enough for building just 55 miles of barricades, not the 200-plus miles he had sought.
Notably, the word “wall” — which fueled many a chant at Trump campaign events and then his rallies as president — does not appear once in the 1,768 pages of legislation and explanatory materials. “Barriers” and “fencing” are the nouns of choice.
The compromise would also squeeze funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in an attempt to pressure the agency to gradually detain fewer immigrants.
Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, House Freedom Caucus chair Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) warned “it would be political suicide” if the president backs the bill and does not seek money elsewhere to fund the wall.

1226,"For the last two seasons, G Farms has depended on legal migrant workers to harvest potatoes, onions and watermelons growing in its fields on the outskirts of Phoenix. Now the farm is bearing different fruit: a first-of-its-kind federal lawsuit that federal officials and immigration activists say exemplifies the pitfalls of the nation’s agricultural visa program—as Congress proposes changes to it. This year the U.S. Labor Department took the farm to court, saying its owner, Santiago Gonzalez, underpaid some of its 69 workers by not offering a set, hourly wage and housed them in an “encampment” consisting of yellow school buses and semitrailers that “violated numerous safety, sanitation and fire code regulations.” Janet Herold, the regional solicitor in charge of the case for the Labor Department, called the living situations a “horror show” that could have led to many worker deaths. The case is the first time the department won a preliminary injunction against a farm using the temporary farmworker visa, known as the H2A. A federal judge barred the business from housing the workers in the encampment, forcing it to house them in an apartment complex and an extended-stay motel for the rest of the season. Mr. Gonzalez declined to comment. His attorney said he is cooperating with federal officials. The case comes as demand for foreign farmworkers soars, and as Congress is expected to introduce a measure later this year that could make changes to guest worker programs. The Labor Department has certified 160,084 workers through the program so far this year, a 20% increase from the year-earlier period. President Donald Trump has discussed a revamped guest worker program with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. Mexico received 92% of the H2A visas issued last year, according to data from the U.S. State Department. Separately, the Trump administration is backing a proposal to cut the number of green cards annually by half. U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a member of the Agriculture Committee, last month said it was “well past the time to replace the outdated and onerous H2A program” and activists said they expect him to introduce a bill aimed at the program later this year. Jason Resnick, vice president and general counsel for the Western Growers Association, which represents local and regional farmers in Arizona, California and Colorado, said there has “historically been good oversight and enforcement in the H2A program, and this case demonstrates that those enforcement mechanisms are working. ... So if those allegations are true, it shows the Department of Labor is on top of its compliance and enforcement obligations,” he said. Critics say the H2A program has been rife with abuse because of poor living conditions and wages for workers. The Labor Department and state officials said this week they are investigating the death of a farmworker on an H2A visa working in rural Washington state, which led to protests from other workers. In a rare instance of agreement between immigration-rights activists and the Trump administration, immigration advocates welcomed scrutiny from the federal government in the G Farms case. Bruce Goldstein, president of the group Farmworker Justice, said he was pleased with “an aggressive stand in court against the abuses.” But he said he fears that efforts to revamp the program—either through Mr. Goodlatte’s measure, or through a series of bills already introduced in the Republican-controlled Congress—could weaken worker protections under the program if signed by Mr. Trump. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue recently hired a former American Farm Bureau Federation lobbyist that critics on both the left and the right expect will lead the push for an H2A expansion. One bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives would move oversight of the program from the Labor Department to the Agriculture Department, which is considered more favorable to industry. Critics fear another bill in the U.S. Senate—which would create a pilot program for states to have their own guest-worker program—could remove federal oversight of the program. Another bill proposed by Rep. Rick Allen (R., Ga.) would limit the ability of legal aid attorneys to represent agricultural guest workers. That bill would also move administration of the program to the Agriculture Department, change the methodology for how wage rates are calculated and eliminate the obligation to provide housing as long as a state’s governor certified that farmworker housing was available. “Right now many farmworkers in the U.S. are experiencing a housing crisis,” Mr. Goldstein said. “Many farmworkers are already living in very crowded shelters, sometimes it is a house, sometimes it is a trailer, sometimes they are just living in cars.” In some parts of rural California, for instance, farm labor has essentially “cornered the market for small hotels that were used by low-income folks,” said Cynthia Rice, director of litigation at California Rural Legal Assistance Inc. The Trump administration declined to comment regarding the bills before Congress. Meanwhile, demand is on the rise from the agricultural industry for more H2A visas, as the Trump administration cracks down on illegal immigration and farms struggle to find enough workers. To escape the brutal heat and living conditions at the Arizona farm, “some workers left the cargo containers and took refuge in a nearby open-air shed to sleep on discarded bus seats that were being stored there,” the Labor Department said in court documents. Michael King, the attorney representing the farm, said “the housing conditions were corrected immediately as soon as notification was given” and that the government didn’t have to pursue its suit. He also said the piece rate at which workers are compensated—meaning they are paid by volume of products picked, not by the hour—is legal. But he added that many workers were paid less than what would be equivalent to the legally required $10.95 an hour during their first weeks of work because they were adjusting to the pace of labor. “In our view, the lawsuit that got filed almost immediately didn’t need to be filed,” he said. “Our client had already fixed all the deficiencies.” The Labor Department said in court documents that G Farms failed to keep records of the hours of its workers. Emilio Chaparro García, 37 years old and one of the workers whose treatment prompted the suit, said he came to Arizona to work for G Farms from the small town of Sinaloa de Leyva in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico, to save money to send his three daughters to school. This season was his second with G Farms, and he said he believes the farm treated workers well. He has been coming to the U.S. as a seasonal worker since 2008 using the H2A visa, he said. After the Labor Department’s intervention, he was paid $10.95 an hour and worked eight hours a day on the farm. At night, he slept in the motel. Four other Mexican laborers interviewed by The Journal with their employer present echoed his sentiments, with all of them declining to say their living conditions or pay had been an issue. “We were living good, we weren’t lacking in anything,“ Mr. Chaparro García said. ”We had everything we needed.” Ms. Herold, of the Labor Department, said it was workers themselves who called the Mexican Consulate about the conditions, and the Mexican Consulate alerted her office. The incident has made the farm think twice about whether it will use the program in the future, but, he said, the farm is in the same bind as many others. There simply isn’t enough accessible labor. “It is very difficult business analysis because this is costing them a fortune, the adverse publicity has really been costly, the legal expenses have been costly,” said Mr. King, the farm’s lawyer. “But without the H2A visa workers it is very, very hard to harvest onions and watermelons in Arizona.”",0
2496,"The Trump administration is shifting $271 million earmarked for disaster aid and cyber security to pay for immigration-related facilities, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a leading congressional Democrat said on Tuesday. The money, which was also set aside for the U.S. Coast Guard, will be used to pay for detention facilities and courts for migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. DHS officials say they have been overwhelmed by a surge of asylum-seeking migrants fleeing violence and poverty in Central America. The Trump administration is seeking to circumvent Congress to move money originally designated for other programs. This will allow the administration to continue to house immigrants arriving at the border, part of President Donald Trump’s promise not to allow them to await hearings outside of custody. The administration plans to take $115 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster-relief fund just as hurricane season is heating up in the Atlantic Ocean, according to a letter from U.S. Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, who chairs the congressional panel that oversees Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spending. Money will be taken for planned upgrades to the National Cybersecurity Protection System and new equipment for the U.S. Coast Guard, the letter said. DHS said Congress did not provide enough money for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to detain single adults as they wait for their cases to be heard by an immigration judge. Congress appropriated $2.8 billion to pay for 52,000 beds this year, but ICE is currently detaining more than 55,000 immigrants, a record high, according to agency statistics. Roybal-Allard said DHS was exceeding its authority to move money around to respond to emergencies. “Once again, DHS has ignored the negotiated agreement with Congress by vastly exceeding the amount appropriated for immigration enforcement and removal operations,” she said in a statement. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, urged the Trump administration to reconsider the shift in funds. “Stealing from appropriated funds is always unacceptable, but to pick the pockets of disaster relief funding in order to fund an appalling, inhumane family incarceration plan is staggering - and to do so on the eve of hurricane season is stunningly reckless,” Pelosi said in a statement. FEMA spokeswoman Lizzie Litzow said the funding reduction will not impact readiness efforts or other functions for which the money was earmarked. Trump has made cracking down on legal and illegal immigration a hallmark of his presidency after campaigning in 2016 on a promise, so far unfulfilled, that Mexico would pay for a border wall to keep migrants from entering the United States. A record-setting 42,000 families were apprehended along the U.S. southern border in July, more than twice as many as in May. Last week, DHS unveiled a new rule that would allow officials to detain migrant families indefinitely - abolishing a previous 20-day limit - while judges consider whether to grant them asylum in the United States.",0
633,"The exodus of Venezuelans to neighboring countries could soon eclipse the number of refugees flowing from Syria at the height of the country’s civil war.
More than three million Venezuelans have fled the country and now live in countries like Argentina or even the U.S., according to a review of figures provided by the International Migration Organization and the United Nations Agency for Refugees. More than 330,000 Venezuelans have declared asylum in countries throughout the Americas.
Colombia has absorbed the largest amount of migrants, with 1,200,000 Venezuelans currently living there. 
For comparison, U.N. figures put the total number of Syrian asylum seekers during the 2015 refugee crisis in Europe at over 450,000. By December 2017, one million Syrians applied for asylum throughout the continent.
Globally, roughly five million Syrians are displaced outside of their home country. Nearly three million Syrians currently reside in Turkey.
At the beginning of January 2018, there was a 20,500 percent increase in asylum seeking applications from Venezuelans compared to one year prior. The United Nations says that from 2012 to November 2018, asylum applications from Venezuelans increased 74,191 percent.
The Caracas Chronicles, a news organizations dedicated to covering Venezuela’s economic collapse, says the “general profile” of a Venezuelan migrant is most likely a 31-year-old single male with some level of education.
Neighboring South American countries have struggled processing the surge of migrants looking for work and protection. Ecuador saw as many as 4,200 Venezuelans arriving in the country a day in August 2018.",1
2311,"The Trump administration on Monday told the federal judge who blocked a temporary travel ban on citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries that it was keeping its legal options open pending further word from a federal appeals court.
In a response to Judge James Robart that was due Monday afternoon, the Justice Department said scheduled proceedings in his Washington state court should be delayed until the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit decides whether to rehear the government's case.
""At this time, defendants believe the appropriate course is to postpone any further proceedings in the district court,"" acting Assistant Attorney General Chad Readler wrote.
But the states of Washington and Minnesota urged Robart to skip further procedural steps and begin hearing their case against the travel ban on the merits. ""Given the gravity of the states’ constitutional allegations, defendants’ stated national security concerns, and the public interests at stake, the states respectfully submit that discovery should proceed without delay,"" lawyers for the two states said.
With two strikes against the ban already this month — first from Robart, then from a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit — the full appeals court is weighing whether to hear Trump's plea to restart the travel ban while the legal challenge continues. Both the government and the states must provide their input by Thursday.
It is unlikely the full appeals court will vote to rehear the case, since the large majority of its judges were named by Democratic presidents, but at that point objecting judges would be able to voice dissents. The rulings against the ban came from two judges nominated by Democrats and two by Republicans.
If the appeals court decides against a rehearing, the government could appeal to the Supreme Court, continue the case before the three-judge panel, return to Robart's district court in Seattle, or rewrite the executive order in an effort to make it easier to uphold in court. At this point, all those options remain on the table.
Trump's ban, announced Jan. 27, temporarily barred citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days, and Syrian citizens indefinitely. It led to chaos at U.S. and international airports as tens of thousands of visa holders were blocked from entering the country or detained after arriving in the U.S.
A barrage of protests and lawsuits followed, leading to federal court rulings against the ban in New York, Virginia and elsewhere. One judge in Massachusetts later ruled in Trump's favor, but since then judges from Alexandria, Va., to Seattle have said it may violate the constitutional rights of visa holders, green card holders and others, and that it lacks sufficient national security justification.
The Trump administration contends that the president has authority under the Constitution and congressional statute to control immigration for national security purposes. They point to a 1952 law that allows a president to bar entry to immigrants or classes of immigrants if the president deems them to be ""detrimental to the interests of the United States.""
The appeals court panel said that although the president should get ""considerable deference"" in the areas of immigration and national security, ""it is beyond question that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action.",0

87,"As the Trump administration regroups from multiple political and legal setbacks in its efforts to curb illegal immigration, the message south of the border could not be more clear, with families and unaccompanied minors flooding into Texas, Arizona and California. An alarming new report from the Department of Homeland Security shows the number of families crossing into the U.S. illegally surged last month. The agency said illegal immigrants have been taking advantage of a legal loophole that requires “family units” to be released once they are caught. New figures showed a 10 percent increase in August of unaccompanied minors, a 38 percent increase among families entering illegally or asking for asylum. Overall, people arrested or stopped at the border totaled nearly 47,000 in August, up 17 percent from July and up 52 percent from August 2017. Why are illegal immigrants opting out of welfare programs?Video
""These numbers are a result of our failure do what is necessary to control the border,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the right-leaning Center for Immigration Studies. The administration tried separating parents and children to deter immigrants from making the dangerous trek through Mexico, however a political outcry forced it to reverse the policy. It also tried holding in families in detention until their court date, but the courts rejected the policy. As a result, Customs and Border Protection sources say, immigrants see an opportunity to exploit gridlock in Washington and get in while the administration tries to figure out its next step. ""My question is how many illegal immigrants have to be let go into the U.S. for there to be a political demand that something be done about it,"" said Krikorian, who favors stricter border enforcement. The numbers say something entirely different to Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum. ""The situation in Central America is so bad, parents are deciding that the risk of losing their child to the U.S. government is better than the risk of losing their child to violence,"" said Noorani. ""This leaves lawmakers two choices. They can continue a failed strategy of trying to enforce our way out of a problem... Or, they can develop bipartisan solutions that address root causes in Central America and ensure migrants fleeing violence and persecution can seek protection and a fair hearing in the U.S.” In the last nine months, 98.6 percent of families who entered the U.S. illegally or without papers from countries other than Mexico, remain here, and officials say it's likely most will never leave. ""We know that the vast majority of family units who have been released, despite having no right to remain in any legal status, fail to ever depart or be removed,"" DHS Press Secretary Tyler Q. Houlton said Wednesday in a statement. ""Through the third quarter of FY 2018, only 1.4 percent of family units have been repatriated to their home country from noncontiguous countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras."" The highest number of minors and families entering arrived from Guatemala (64,000) following by Honduras (43,000), El Salvador (16,000) and Mexico (11,000). The biggest change agents see is the size of groups they encounter. Instead of a handful of immigrants or groups under 10, they are now apprehending groups of 20 or more. In Lukeville, Arizona, last week, agents stopped a group of 50 spanning a half-mile wide. Instead of running from agents, the immigrants sought them out to request asylum. ""Right now, the word is out. Bring a child,"" a Border Patrol agent in Arizona told OutletName. ""That's their ticket. If they come as an adult, they can be held. If they come as family, or as minor, they can't. They know it. The smugglers tell them."" The Trump administration said Tuesday it's tried to handle the influx by tripling the amount of bed space for unaccompanied minors at its detention camp in Tornillo, Texas, so it can handle up to 3,800 children. It also added 44 new immigration judges and has considered a policy change allowing it to hold families in detention together until their immigration cases are heard. That is likely to face a legal challenge, especially since federal Judge Dolly Gee already declined to change her ruling, that families in detention must be released after 20 days.",1
2256,"Jorge Garcia was torn away from his Lincoln Park family in January. Brought to the United States at 10, Garcia was not eligible for the DACA program. He has two teenagers and a wife and is now waiting to see what his future will be.
Jorge Garcia was deported recently from Detroit and is without his wife and children. Garcia says he doesn't get out much and is depressed. Garcia’s two small cousins blow bubbles out in front of their home Sunday, Jan. 28, 2018. NICOLÁS ROMERO, Standing outside his new home sloped on a bumpy street, Jorge Garcia turns his head and gazes down the block of a working-class city about an hour west of Mexico City.
Roving vendors hawk everything from tamales to gasoline, yelling out the names of their products. A few houses down, a rooster crows. His new neighbors glance at him warily.
""I feel like I'm lost,"" Garcia says, his eyes taking in the valley and hills of the city of Nicolás Romero on a Friday morning in January. ""I don't fit in here, at all.”
Two weeks earlier, Garcia was deported from Michigan to Mexico after living in the U.S. for 30 years, forced to leave behind his family, friends, and a solid job in landscaping. Now, the married father of two finds himself alone in an unfamiliar country, with an uncertain future.
""Since I've got here, I haven't had a good night's sleep,"" he explains, fingers fidgeting with each other as he speaks. ""It's like my body wants to rest, but I'm not able to with all this thought I've got on my mind and the stress. ... During the night, out of nowhere in my sleep, I start thinking about the whole situation and I lose my sleep.""
Garcia recites a Hail Mary and the Lord's Prayer every night before bed, but it’s not enough to calm him down.
""I just keep tossing and turning. Tossing and turning.”
After the Free Press reported on his deportation on Jan. 15, Garcia became a symbol for immigrant advocates who say his removal is an example of the government's overzealous crackdown on illegal immigrants. He was only 10 years old when an aunt brought him to the U.S. without authorization. Now 39, he had lived his entire adult life in the U.S. before his removal.
Garcia has no criminal record, but the U.S. now says that anyone without legal status can be removed. ICE has defended his deportation.
Nicolás Romero is not an easy place to navigate for a newcomer. It’s a challenge to get to and from Mexico City, up and down winding hills with speed bumps and graffiti-strewn buildings that house people struggling to find jobs. Last year, riots and looting broke out in Nicolás Romero after the Mexican government raised gasoline prices, according to media reports.
Garcia lives with his aunt on the second floor of a tidy house that's painted green, with pet cats roaming around. While he’s glad to at least have a family member to stay with, he has lost control of his life.
He doesn’t have his own bathroom, he relies on others to buy and prepare food. He was unsure how to get his blood pressure medication until a cousin helped him figure out the bureaucracy in Mexico.
Recently deported Jorge Garcia, 39, walks the streets of Nicolas Romero, Mexico where he lives. Garcia feels like an outsider and misses his wife and children back in Lincoln Park. He misses his Michigan block, his dog, his steady, content life in an American suburb. Most of all, he misses his wife, Cindy, and his two children, Jorge Jr., 12, and Soleil, 15.
“I used to tell them, good night, every night,” Garcia says. “And now, if I can get a signal, I’ll call them, but it’s not the same. I’m not actually there.”
Garcia's only connection to his American life comes through his cell phone — if it works. He tries to keep in touch with his wife and kids, but phone service is spotty up in the hills.
These days, Garcia mostly stays inside his spare bedroom. He only comes downstairs for meals or to watch TV if his aunt has it on. He’s trying to make him himself get out more, but he’s anxious about the neighbors, wondering how they might perceive a transplant like him.
""Most of the time, I just want to be in the room by myself.”
'He has no one'
Jorge Garcia was born in Guanajuato, a few hours northwest of Mexico City, and later moved with his parents to Nicolás Romero to a house that is just across the street from where he’s living now.
Back then, “there were just a handful of houses and the rest of it was nothing but empty land,” he says, looking at his former home, painted blue with a concrete front.
“Now, it’s like everything changed. Everywhere you go, there’s no empty lots anymore.”
The population of Nicolás Romero, located in the state of Mexico, has jumped as people flock to an affordable area where they can commute to jobs in the Mexico City area. The surge has created congestion and economic tensions at times.
A man walks by ringing a loud bell, announcing that garbage collection is coming soon. Loud music blares from homes on this block, waking him early, a stark contrast to his quiet block in Lincoln Park in the U.S.
When he lived in the U.S., Garcia thought he might visit this place one day, never imagining ""I would be back here in this situation,” he says.
In the 1980s, Garcia’s parents came to the U.S. and still live there undocumented. In 1989, another aunt brought Garcia to the U.S. He graduated from middle school and high schools in Chicago.
When he started to apply for jobs and considered college, Garcia realized he was undocumented. He and his family then moved to Detroit, where he met Cindy at a dance. She was a U.S. citizen born to immigrants from Mexico.
""I was like the only one sitting down and she comes up to me and tells me, 'Hey, you wanna dance?' So we started dancing and after that, we started talking and basically after that we started going out. … We decide to get married, start having kids.""
The couple married in 2002.
Since 2005, the Garcias have been fighting for Jorge to obtain legal status, spending more than $100,000 on attorneys and fees. The couple says that one of their previous attorneys had filed the wrong paperwork and Jorge was ordered removed in 2009, but he was repeatedly allowed stays of deportation until November 2017.
Jorge feels that he is being punished despite being open with immigration officials about his status and working for years to gain U.S. residency.
""For trying to do the right thing, everything came out wrong,"" he said.
Cindy, 45, is on retired disability from a Dearborn truck plant after going through two C-sections and years of heavy lifting at work.
While she, too, is going through challenges, she says: “At least I have my children. He has no one. He's in a country he doesn't know. He is living with a family he has not seen for years. He's not getting much sleep. He wakes up every day at three in the morning. … it's going to eventually catch up to him.
""He's hurting his own self because he needs to get the rest. He needs to move on. But it's hard for him because he's all alone in a country he does not know, even though that is where he was born, and it's not his home.
""His home is the U.S. of A.”
Help for those deported
What happened to Garcia has become increasingly common in recent years as Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. are deported or move back to Mexico because of their undocumented status.
More Mexican nationals are returning to Mexico while the number of Mexicans moving to the U.S. is decreasing, according to a Pew Research Center report. From 2009 to 2014, about 1 million Mexican-Americans moved from the U.S. to Mexico.
Under President Donald Trump, the number of deportations has slightly decreased, but that’s largely because the numbers of those crossing the Southern border has decreased. The number of interior removals — targeting people like Garcia — increased over the past year, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) statistics on removals last year.
The stories of what happens to people like Garcia often get drowned out by talk of those who remain in the U.S. The White House and Congress are currently debating what to do with DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, the children of undocumented immigrants.
Garcia is one year too old to quality for DACA, and others like him who don't qualify are now back in Mexico.
Jill Anderson, an advocate who helps people who have been deported to Mexico, says that the alienation that Garcia is feeling is common.
""One hundred percent of the people that I've interviewed over the years experienced depression after a deportation, or even after a return,"" says Anderson, co-founder of Otros Dreams en Acción (Other Dreams in Action), for people like Garcia. ""It is so alienating and shocking, and deportation. ... I consider it inhumane, and cruel and unusual punishment.""
Friends and family of deported Mexican citizens from the United States meet at the kickoff for Poch by Otros Dreams en Accion, an organiziation designed to help deported citizens adjust back into Mexican life. Enrique Rojas, (right) shares his story during a visas and waivers workshop after being deported from Indiana in 2011. The story of Garcia reached Mexico City, where numerous media outlets reported on his removal from the U.S.
""I read about Jorge Garcia's case last week when it came out, and I was just, I mean, so devastated,"" Anderson says.
Under President Barack Obama, about 2 million people were deported or voluntarily returned to Mexico from the U.S., says Anderson.
""Even knowing the numbers of deportation and detentions, we're talking about over 2 million families alone here in Mexico under Obama were deported or returned due to deportation or fear of deportation.
""Now, we know those numbers are increasing, and they're increasing (with) families like Jorge. … ICE calls it interior removals. So instead of deporting people who are in the process of crossing, they're deporting people who have been there 10 years, 20 years, 30 years.""
On a recent Saturday, Anderson helped inaugurate a new center created by Otros Dreams in Accion called Pocha House.
Inside a building, up three flights of stairs, in a bustling section of Mexico City, a group of Mexicans who used to live in the U.S. gathered in a circle at the center to share their stories of starting again in Mexico.
Enrique Rojas, 30 — who was born in Mexico but lived in the U.S. from 1999 to 2011, when he was deported from Indiana — kicked off the session, speaking in Spanish about his challenges. A woman in a similar situation asked a legal adviser about whether she has a chance at returning to the U.S.
""Es muy dificil,"" the adviser said to her over speakerphone. ""It’s very difficult.""
On a wall in Pocha House, a sign reads ""De Aqui De Alla"" (From Here, From There), referring to people with roots in both Mexico and the U.S. Below are photos of people deported.
The word ""pocha"" or ""pocho"" is often used as an insult by some Mexicans for Mexican-Americans who return to Mexico. Upon returning, some face teasing for their accents or American ways. Places like Pocha House, which Anderson helped create, help ease the transition and provide a support network and logistical help.
""Navigating the Mexican bureaucracy is very alienating,"" Anderson says. ""It's hard even for a Mexican citizen who's been there their whole lives, to navigate this bureaucracy, but then, if you haven't been here, you don't have the connections. You don't have the understanding, it's really hard.""
Jorge Garcia looks into a shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe built by a neighbor, he was deported recently from Detroit and is now trying to adjust to life in a small town outside of Mexico City. 'She ... helps me keep my faith'
On a Sunday morning in Mexico, Garcia ambled down a block next to his house that he had never traveled before. He wore a hooded sweatshirt with the logo of the landscaping company he worked for in Wyandotte: “KS Landscaping: Landscape, Lawn, Snow.”
He has been in this place for almost two weeks, but barely ventures outside.
On his left, he spots a purple shrine outside a home to Our Lady of Guadalupe, the iconic Catholic image revered by millions of Mexicans. Inside a glass-walled enclosure was a statue of her.
""She lifts me, helps me keep my faith,"" Garcia says, while starting at her. ""Gives me a little bit more of relaxation, too.""
Jorge Garcia has become a spokesman for immigrant rights, and while the attention can be overwhelming at times, he says he hopes it can help others.
""If it's going to help somebody with anything that they're going through, then I'm not just doing it for me, I'm doing it for others, too,"" he says.
He tries to follow the latest news on the immigration discussions in the U.S. One possible DACA bill could allow immigrants like Garcia to stay in the U.S.
""I just hope that they come to an agreement,"" he says. ""There are so many people, they're going to be affected if they don't come to an agreement … help people that are trying to go to school or become better in life.""
For now, Garcia's hoping that attempts by his wife and attorney to get him back home to Lincoln Park will succeed. They’re currently filing paperwork with the U.S. Embassy in Mexico to grant him a wavier to be admitted back in the U.S. That process could take at least 18 months to even get an interview with the embassy to be considered.
These days, when he looks out the window of his spare bedroom in his new home, Garcia can see a wooded area and beyond that a hill on which sits the colorful homes of Nicolás Romero.
He wonders how long this will be his view.
""I’ve been thinking about getting my own place, but everything is going to depend when I get my interview"" with the embassy, he says.
He worries he can’t be there in person to help his teenage children.
""It’s sad because even … though I can talk to them on the phone, it's not the same,"" he says. ""I told them before I left, you can call me anytime, whenever you need anything. … but I didn't think it was going to be this bad with cell phone reception.""
""I love them, and I miss them, and I hope all of this goes through fast so we can meet pretty soon again."" ",0
1313,"Federal immigration authorities knew for years that Roberto Beristain was living in the U.S. illegally, but they allowed him to stay. He had married, was raising four children and building a business in Indiana. Each year he was required to check in with immigration officials and prove he was staying out of trouble. He did that for five years without incident—until February, when officials detained him during his check-in. Now Mr. Beristain, 43, is in jail and scheduled to be deported to his native Mexico on Friday. “I want to stay with my wife and children,” Mr. Beristain wrote in a recent petition, since denied, to have his deportation stopped. “Please don’t take me away from my family.” His case shows the risks undocumented immigrants face as they navigate a complex immigration system after a realignment of enforcement priorities under the Trump administration. The terrain is particularly ambiguous for the nearly one million immigrants such as Mr. Beristain, who face outstanding deportation orders but remain in the U.S. Previous administrations focused on deporting illegal immigrants who committed violent crimes, and largely avoided deporting nonviolent immigrants, even if they had violated immigration law by entering the country illegally or overstaying visas. Under President Donald Trump, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they primarily are still targeting violent criminals for deportation, but no longer ignoring other undocumented immigrants with orders to leave the country. “With very limited exceptions, ICE will no longer exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement,” said Jennifer D. Elzea, an ICE spokeswoman. “Any alien encountered during the course of targeted enforcement actions is subject to removal.” Immigrant advocates say the new ICE position sows fear among undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. trouble-free for years, some under various arrangements with federal officials that permit them to go to school or work, like Mr. Beristain. Others say such workarounds degrade U.S. immigration law, and that strict enforcement is necessary to maintain the borders. Those with removal orders “have clearly violated U.S. immigration laws, at a minimum, and have had a fair chance to make their case to remain here,” said David Ray, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports immigration-enforcement measures. “The only way U.S. immigration laws will be taken seriously by prospective illegal aliens is if they are fairly and effectively enforced.” Immigration officials deported an Arizona mother of two U.S.-born children earlier this year who had also been allowed to remain in the U.S. as long as she checked in with immigration officials, like Mr. Beristain. That arrangement, known as an order of supervision, allows officials to monitor undocumented immigrants instead of jailing them while they await deportation, according to immigration officials and lawyers. Immigration officials say more than 961,000 people have final orders of removal, but aren’t in detention. “The appropriate conditions of release are determined on a case-by-case basis after a review of the individual facts of the case,” ICE officials said in a statement. A spokesman for ICE confirmed that Mr. Beristain was taken into custody “based on his final order of removal” that took effect in 2000, after a judge told him he had 60 days to leave the country voluntarily. People like Mr. Beristain are low-hanging fruit for enforcement actions, immigration attorneys say. Heather Prendergast, an immigration attorney in Cleveland and head of American Immigration Lawyers Association’s National ICE Liaison Committee, said lawyers noted “a marked increase” in immigrants detained at their check-ins during supervised released. “I don’t know how to advise my clients—I can’t say ‘I don’t think you are going to be arrested,’ because that is not what the facts are bearing out right now,” she said. Mr. Beristain drove into the U.S. from Mexico in 1997, to visit an aunt in California, said his wife and stepson. He moved to Fort Wayne, Ind., where, working at a restaurant as a bus boy, he met the woman who would become his wife, Helen, a Greek immigrant, who was a waitress. “It was love at first sight,” said Phil Kolliopoulos, Mr. Beristain’s stepson. His wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen, voted for Mr. Trump. A Republican, she agreed with the idea that criminals shouldn’t be in the U.S. illegally, but said she never imagined her husband, who has no criminal record, would be targeted. Mr. Beristain came to the attention of immigration authorities during a 2000 family trip to Niagara Falls, N.Y. He was driving on a bridge leading to Canada when he turned around, drawing the attention of an officer who determined Mr. Beristain was in the country illegally. A New York judge gave Mr. Beristain the option to voluntarily leave the country. He chose to stay because Helen was pregnant. The voluntary deportation became a removal order. Mr. Beristain hired an attorney, applied for a green card and, in 2012, was allowed to stay in the U.S., as long as he kept his record clean, his wife said. He was permitted a Social Security card, work permit and a driver's license, and paid taxes. Despite being married to a U.S. citizen, he could not secure a relative visa because of his deportation order, according to an attorney who worked with Mr. Beristain on his immigration case. Mr. Beristain recently purchased Eddie’s Steak Shed in Granger, Ind., from his sister and brother in law, his wife and stepson said. He worked long hours, they said, arriving at the restaurant at 8 a.m. and not leaving until well after its nightly closing. This year, when it came time for him to meet with immigration officials in Florida, where his attorney was based, he was told to report to an office in Indianapolis on Feb. 6. When he showed up, he was taken into custody. Adam Ansari, a Chicago attorney and an advocate for the family, said he has been approaching members of Congress about writing a private bill for Mr. Beristain, but so far has had no luck. The family has also moved to reopen his case.",0
2178,"Federal officials say the dumping of several hundred immigrants at an El Paso bus station over Christmas weekend, which caused a short-term crisis, was a mistake, city officials said Friday.
Federal authorities dropped off hundreds of migrants at the Greyhound station in downtown El Paso with no notice late that Sunday, sparking an outcry from community organizations that scrambled to find shelter and food for migrants.
Authorities continued releasing hundreds of migrants in downtown through Christmas Day.
""According to ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officials we communicated with, they stated (the unscheduled release) was just a mistake,"" El Paso Fire Chief Mario D'Agostino said during a press conference at the city's 9-1-1 call center in Northeast El Paso. ""It was an error on their part.""
Most of the immigrants come from Central America, with many fleeing violence or extreme poverty.
Federal officials made no indication that leaving about 600 immigrants at the Greyhound bus station from Sunday through Christmas Day was related to the current federal government shutdown, D'Agostino said.
The shutdown is tied to an impasse between Congress and the White House over funding for a border wall proposed by President Donald Trump.
El Paso City Manager Tommy Gonzalez said in a phone interview with The El Paso Times that he and the fire chief talked to the ICE regional director, who apologized for the unscheduled release of the immigrants in El Paso during Christmas weekend.
City officials plan to talk to ICE and other officials next week about ""the need to come up with some solutions"" on the entire process of releasing immigrants and ""how to treat them,"" Gonzalez said.
The city brought in police officers as a ""public safety"" measure at the Greyhound bus station Sunday night when about 200 immigrants were left there by ICE agents, Gonzalez said.
Ruben Garcia, executive director of Annunciation House, and Deputy Fire Chief Jorge Rodriguez, city Emergency Management coordinator, talk about immigrants being dumped by federal agents at an El Paso bus station during a Dec. 28 press conference. The city's Sun Metro bus system also supplied heated buses for immigrants to stay in until shelters could be found, officials said.
The response by city agencies and others shows ""Texas and the rest of the United States that we're very compassionate as a community,"" Gonzalez said.
The continual flow of immigrants has become more of an issue since June when the federal government set up temporary tent shelters, including one in Tornillo, near El Paso, to house immigrant children separated from their parents.
The immigration issue has again come to the forefront after two immigrant children recently died in Border Patrol custody.
Ruben Garcia is executive director of the Annunciation House, a nonprofit El Paso organization that aides and shelters immigrants. He said the normal process of ICE bringing immigrants to shelters or hotels identified by Annunciation House has been working well for years.
Problems come when immigrants are unexpectedly released at the bus station or on the streets, which happened during Christmas weekend and earlier in October, he said.
Annunciation House has received more than 2,000 immigrants per week for the last two months — the ""fourth surge"" of immigrants into the area in the past six years, Garcia said.
However, the number of immigrants staying near El Paso has actually decreased in recent years, Garcia said, as has the number of immigrants apprehended by Border Patrol.
""Nobody stays in El Paso; everybody moves on"" after receiving temporary housing and care packages, Garcia said of the current surge of immigrants.
Immigrants move to other areas of the United States by getting bus or airplane tickets, usually paid for by' relatives, Garcia said. The immigrants can stay in the United States until their cases are heard in federal court.
""So, El Paso doesn't have to deal with a growing refugee population,"" Garcia said.",0
760,"Several media outlets have published stories linking the migrant caravan to global warming.
Thousands of migrants from Central American countries, such as Honduras and Guatemala, are making their way through Mexico to the U.S. border to declare asylum.
Those in the media looking for a global warming angle to the story found experts who say the migrant caravan is a preview of the waves of “climate refugees” that will come with more global warming.
Media outlets want you to know the Central American migrant caravan heading to the U.S.-Mexico border isn’t just about fleeing poverty and violence, it’s also about global warming.
OutletName cited “experts” who “say the big picture is that changing climate is forcing farmers off their land – and it’s likely to get worse.” The OutletName said the migrant caravan “foreshadows” what’s to come with global warming.
Likewise, E&E News called the caravan a “preview of climate migrations” — that is people driven from their homes due to man-made global warming.
Thousands of migrants from Central American countries, such as Honduras and Guatemala, are making their way through Mexico to the U.S. border to declare asylum. Many of the migrants recounted horrific stories of organized crime, extreme poverty and lack of opportunity.
However, those in the media looking for a global warming angle to the story found experts who say the migrant caravan is a preview of the waves of “climate refugees” that will come with more global warming.
“It’s a future that’s rapidly arriving,” Frank Femia, co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security, told E&E News. Femia is also a major proponent of the theory that global warming helped spark the Syrian civil war. Proponents argue global warming exacerbated a multi-year drought that sparked the Arab Spring uprising in 2011, which eventually led to civil war.
It’s part of a larger theory that global warming can lead to violent conflict in vulnerable areas of the world. The Obama administration’s Defense Department even considered global warming a “threat multiplier.”
Conflict scholars have largely debunked many of the claims linking global warming to armed conflict and migration, but the media is trying to continue the narrative by linking global warming to Central American migrations.
For example, OutletName reported that “climate change in the region is exacerbating – and sometimes causing – a miasma of other problems including crop failures and poverty.”
“And they warn that in the coming decades, it is likely to push millions more people north towards the US,” the paper reported.
Like in Syria, supposed experts are pointing Central America’s struggle with recent droughts that caused thousands of acres worth of crops of maize and beans to fail. United Nations officials warned that millions are at risk of going hungry.
Central American officials claim global warming is part of the reason why their citizens are fleeing en mass, though.
“The impacts of climate change are part of the triggers of migration,” the Central American Commission for Environment and Development said in a statement released Thursday.
The recent droughts to hit Central America were driven by the incredibly strong El Nino that hit in 2015 and has persisted. El Nino, however, is a regularly-occurring natural phenomenon, not the product of human emissions.
And when it comes to droughts, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found “low confidence in a global-scale observed trend in drought or dryness (lack of rainfall) since the middle of the 20th century.”
OutletName also noted that federal data showed “a surge in outward migration from western Honduras, a prime coffee-producing area.” That’s because the collapse in coffee bean prices has made growing it less profitable, forcing migrants to hit the road.",1
1255,"Even as a caravan of thousands of Honduran migrants makes its way across southern Mexico, another caravan is forming in its wake. Thousands of Honduran migrants gathered in a Guatemalan city near the border with Honduras Tuesday to prepare for a new caravan that would follow in the footsteps of a larger group currently marching to the U.S.-Mexico border, posing a fresh challenge to Guatemalan and Mexican authorities seeking to contain a surge in mass migration. Church-run charities assisting migrants and activists say as many as 2,500 Hondurans who crossed into Guatemala in recent days have gathered in the city of Chiquimula, near the border with Honduras. But estimates of the size of the new group vary widely, from that number down to a few hundred, according to Francesca Fontanini, spokeswoman for the Americas region for the United Nations office on refugees. The migrants say they plan to head to Ciudad Tecun Uman, the Guatemalan border town that was overwhelmed by a larger group of migrants who rushed into Mexico over the weekend. Some 5,000 migrants are already marching northward in Mexico’s southern Chiapas state, according to Mexican authorities, while close to 1,700 Hondurans who requested asylum have been sent to a shelter run by Mexican migration authorities in the city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala. Hundreds of them traveled with children and babies. Migrant-charity workers say the rise of new caravans could signal a new dynamic as migrants band together to seek to avoid hiring human traffickers, known as coyotes, who charge between $4,000 to $8,000 a person for dangerous treks to the U.S. southern border. Another crucial factor: Large caravans are also a lot safer for migrants as they cross some of the world’s most murderous countries. “What we are seeing now is that migrants are leaving in large, massive groups as a way to protect themselves and to protest against the critical conditions that they face in their country, people who are just unable to survive,” said Karla Rivas, coordinator of the Jesuit Migrant Network charity group in the Honduran city of El Progreso. Migrant caravans are a relatively new phenomenon and appear to be gaining traction as an option for people fleeing Central America ever since the April caravan organized by a group called Pueblo Sin Fronteras (People Without Frontiers) was thrust into the public eye by President Trump, said Adam Isacson, a researcher who studies defense and migration trends at the Washington Office on Latin America. Earlier caravans, including the one organized each year around Easter since 2011 by the same group, passed by without much media fanfare and were meant not to carry migrants all the way to the U.S., but rather to highlight the dangers migrants face on their passage through Mexico. “This offers a low-cost alternative” to paying a smuggler, Mr. Isacson said. Ms. Rivas said the migrants are gathering in shelters ahead of their planned trek to the border crossing in Ciudad Tecun Uman, the epicenter of a regional migration crisis that overwhelmed Mexican and Guatemalan security forces on Friday. The new caravans could be drawing inspiration from the current caravan in southern Mexico. Last weekend, Mexican police tried to stop the large group from entering the country, saying they would only allow in between 150 and 200 asylum seekers a day. But the majority sneaked across the border in makeshift rafts. President Trump said the U.S. will end Central American aid as thousands of migrants march toward the U.S. border. The OutletName's Gerald F. Seib explains why this might be counterproductive. Photo: Getty
Mexico’s government has said it won’t use force against illegal migrants, but warned that those who don’t follow Mexico’s immigration laws won’t achieve their objective of reaching the U.S. María Amparo Acevedo, a worker at migrant shelter on the outskirts of Chiquimula, said Tuesday that smaller groups of Honduran migrants, ranging from 30 to 160 people, had been arriving at the shelter over the last few days, with several of them leaving Monday night to join what they described as bigger groups. A migrant in shelter said over the phone that he had left San Pedro Sula, one of the largest and most violent cities in Honduras, by bus at 9 a.m. Monday morning and arrived Tuesday in Chiquimula with six companions. He planned to join larger groups further along the migrant trail to try his chances getting through Mexico to the U.S. border. “We’d like to join up with the others, but if we can’t, we will take our chances, just the seven of us,” he said. In Mexico, meanwhile, hundreds of bone-tired migrants from Honduras sprawled on the streets and central square of the southern Mexican village of Huixtla, looking for shelter from a merciless sun as they waited to resume a long march to the U.S. Personnel from Mexico’s Red Cross treated migrants for foot blisters and dehydration as salsa music blared from nearby speakers. In a kiosk in the central plaza, about a dozen volunteers from a local evangelical church handed out plastic water bottles to migrants. “We provide breakfast, lunch and dinner, and medical help,” said Faustino Gallegos, a volunteer. The group also runs workshops for children and arranges ultrasound scans for pregnant women, he added. The migrants in Huixtla planned to walk to the town of Mapastepec, some 40 miles north, early on Wednesday, organizers said. By the town hall, separate lines of men and women lined up to get free tacos, while workers handed out bottles of water. “Huixtla is a people which knows how to give without receiving anything in return,” yelled a municipal employee into a microphone. Mayor José Luis Laparra said the town has spent about $9,000 for food, water, medical help and security for the 6,000 migrants he estimates have camped out on the town square and along adjacent streets. He expects a lot more caravans to come down the pike. “Another 3,000 more migrants are coming. They see that when they get together they can’t be stopped,” he said.",0
441,"U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers apprehended a Mexican citizen on Friday who is wanted in Texas for sexual assault of a young girl. The fugitive Mexican national has an outstanding warrant for sexual-assault-continuous sexual abuse of a victim under the age of 14 years. The man attempted to enter the U.S. while traveling on a commercial bus.
Forty-one-year-old Martin Gerardo Perez Garcia tried to re-enter the country at the Texas-Mexican border through the Laredo Port of Entry.
Dallas County Sheriff’s Office previously filed a warrant for Perez Garcia’s arrest following the allegations of sexual assault and continuous sexual abuse of a young girl. U.S. Custom and Border Protection (CBP) officers discovered the warrant utilizing their law enforcement databases. Officers also confirmed it through biometric verification searches.
Officers apprehended Perez Garcia at the Juarez-Lincoln International Bridge.
“Our CBP officers are committed to the CBP mission, and one of their responsibilities is to identify fugitives at our ports of entry and returning them to face justice for the crimes they have committed,” said Port Director Albert Flores, Laredo Port of Entry.
“When we encounter persons wanted by other law enforcement agencies, we verify the warrant and then carry out the appropriate law enforcement action.”
This is not an uncommon situation for CBP officers.
On January 28, CBP officers in Laredo apprehended a U.S. citizen attempting to enter Texas via the Laredo Port of Entry by bus. A records check on 67-year-old Gabriel Galvan Rodriguez revealed the man had an outstanding warrant from Marion County, Oregon, according to information obtained from CBP officials by OutletName Texas. A court in Marion County issues the warrant for charges of sexual abuse, officials stated. CBP officers turned the man over to Webb County Sheriff’s Office deputies who transported him to the county jail pending extradition proceedings.
In April 2017, CPB officers arrested a 48-year-old Mexican national attempting to flee prosecution in Oregon by absconding to Mexico, OutletName Texas reported. Officers arrested Santiago Flores-Martinez, a previously deported criminal alien, at the San Ysidro port of entry after learning of a warrant from Clackamas County, Oregon. After his return to Oregon, a jury convicted Flores-Martinez on the charge of sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl. Immigration officials previously deported the man in 2001.
His sentencing hearing is scheduled for Monday.
According to a report by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) entitled “Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,” 6,951 criminal aliens have been booked into Texas jails for sexual assault charges between June 1, 2011, and January 31, 2018. Of those, 3,207 have been convicted.

1433,"Spring is a time of ritual renewal, but some annual traditions are counterproductive. Earlier this month, as it has for years, the world’s largest economy elected to choke off its dynamic potential by arbitrarily denying highly educated foreign workers the ability to enter and stay in the country. The U.S. did that to itself even though research and experience show how much it stands to gain from welcoming these workers under the H-1B visa program. Instead of limiting the admission of skilled workers, immigration authorities should aim to spread the benefits throughout the nation. An H-1B visa allows an American company to create a new stateside job for a foreigner with special skills or training. The visa allows the employee to stay in the country and work for three years, at which point it can be renewed for another three. The H-1B program, created by the Immigration Act of 1990, accounts for nearly all of America’s skilled immigration. It imposes an annual cap of 85,000 new visas: 20,000 for those with at least a master’s degree and another 65,000 that require a bachelor’s. On April 1, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting new H-1B visa petitions for the upcoming fiscal year. As always, demand far exceeded supply. USCIS stopped accepting new petitions April 5, having received more than 85,000. There are tangible costs to the U.S. economy of allocating far fewer skilled-immigrant visas than companies need. Most immediately, the cost is forgone jobs. Over the long run, the cost is forgone ideas, innovation and connections to the world. These costs aren’t borne equally across the U.S., because high-talent immigrants tend to cluster in a few cities. In 2013 a quarter of all H-1B applications were from companies based in three metropolitan areas—New York, San Francisco and San Jose, Calif.—and half were from nine metropolitan areas. Today, America’s 20 most populous counties account for 19% of the country’s total population but 37% of its skilled immigrants. A new report by the Economic Innovation Group has documented the downward spiral in skilled workers, population and dynamism that America’s struggling communities are facing. As a solution, it proposes a new “heartland visa” that would grant entry to a greater number of high-talent immigrants if they agree to live and work in those communities. The overall U.S. population has grown, albeit slowly, in recent years. But about half of all U.S. counties—there are some 3,100, including independent cities and Louisiana parishes—are losing population each year. This decline is stark when examining adults of prime working age, 25 to 54. Fully 80% of U.S. counties—home to 149 million Americans—lost residents in this age range from 2007 to 2017. The decline is even starker in talent. In the fastest-shrinking 10% of counties, the share of the adult population with at least a college degree is only 15.8%. This level of educational attainment is only half what it is in America’s fastest-growth counties. It is equivalent to where America overall was in 1978, or where Mexico is today. The need for high-talent immigrants is especially acute for communities where the loss of prime-age, high-skill workers means falling productivity, fewer start-ups, stagnant wages and real-estate prices, and strained local government finances. The “heartland” visa program, which the report’s authors call place-based visas, or PBVs, could arrest the decline. PBVs would ideally be accompanied by a raise in the overall H-1B visa cap, in part to alleviate that cap’s restrictiveness. Struggling communities would be eligible for PBVs if they met some measure of insufficient dynamism and talent. An immigrant arriving on a PBV would be required to find and maintain a job in his host community within some period of time. Ideally and in contrast to H-1B visas today, PBVs would also be granted to entrepreneurs to start new businesses. The experience of Ohio—a state with a large number of declining-population counties and communities—shows why the idea has promise. A recent study found that in 2016 immigrants accounted for only 4.2% of the state’s overall population, but 11.8% of its science, technology, engineering and mathematics workers. From 2010-15 the number of immigrant entrepreneurs in Ohio increased by 120,000, while the rate at which native-born Americans opened businesses went down. Immigrants also accounted for more than 1 of 5 owners of “Main Street” businesses (such as shops, restaurants and hotels) in the region, which generated about 239,000 jobs for blue-collar, U.S.-born workers. “The immigrants that we’re attracting are disproportionately more educated than the native population, so they bring a lot of, for instance, STEM technical degrees into our region that are necessary to fill jobs that we have available,” a Cincinnati business leader said. “They are increasingly more of our physicians, more of our engineers.” Imagine how much more dynamic Ohio could be with a PBV program. The potential of PBVs has already been realized in Canada and Australia—two countries whose pro-growth immigration policies are widely lauded. Canada’s Provincial Nominee Program allows provinces and territories to choose immigrants who intend to settle in them. Before the PNP, 87% of all Canadian immigrants settled in the three most populous provinces, Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia. But from 2010-15 76% of PNP immigrants planned to settle elsewhere. Of PNP immigrants to Newfoundland and Labrador, the most sparsely populated province, 57% have remained there. “The program spreads the benefits of immigration beyond major cities and helps fill local employment gaps,” a 2017 Canadian government report concluded. The U.S. does not welcome enough high-talent immigrants, and America’s struggling communities especially need them. Place-based visas could address both these problems, welcoming immigrants across America to the benefit of all Americans.",0
1231,"Two national sheriffs organizations are endorsing a new deal between federal immigration officials and 17 Florida sheriffs departments that allows local law enforcement to hold illegal immigrants detained on criminal charges for up to 48 hours past their release date so the federal authorities can pick them up and potentially move to deport them. The plan is intended to get around federal court rulings that bar local law enforcement from holding people just for immigration violations, and allowed them to be sued if they don’t comply. The agreements were announced in Florida on Wednesday. “It’s the best solution, not a perfect solution,” said Pinellas County, Fla., Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said. Mr. Gualtieri, a member of the executive board of the National Sheriffs’ Association, said under the new deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, federal authorities will decide which immigrants will be held for up to two extra days. ICE will have to present sheriffs with a detention notice and an administrative warrant and pay the local authorities $50 for each immigrant detained. Mr. Gualtieri said the agreement means local jails will effectively act as a contractor for ICE for up to two days in a move that mirrors arrangements many local jails already have with the U.S. Marshals Service, which routinely houses federal prisoners in local jails. ICE acting director Thomas Homan said Wednesday the agreements will allow fewer criminals who face deportation released before federal officials can process them. Both the National Sheriffs’ Association and the Major County Sheriffs of America support the agreements. Jonathan Thompson, chief executive and executive director of the National Sheriffs’ Association, said the agreements will make the country safer and help resolve a contentious issue about when and how criminal immigrants can be held in local jails. The American Civil Liberties Union, which has long criticized the government’s immigrant detention policies, said the new agreements only repackage bad policies. “Nothing announced (Wednesday) addresses the basic legal problems with [the policies] that courts have repeatedly recognized, and this is yet another example of the Trump administration running roughshod over the law in pursuit of its mass deportation agenda,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. The federal government has struggled to win cooperation from local police and sheriffs around the country with its requests to detain immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally or who have outstanding deportation orders since the Obama administration. Several federal courts have ruled in recent years that jailing immigrants beyond their release date for civil immigration violations could run afoul of the U.S. constitution, behavior for which local authorities could be held liable. Those rulings led President Barack Obama to scrap the Security Communities Program, which used local jail records to identify suspected illegal immigrants for immigration authorities. The program was credited with helping the Obama administration deport a record of more than 409,000 people in 2012. Mr. Gualtieri said the new agreements in Florida should eliminate constitutional concerns from the courts because the immigrants will be detained on behalf of ICE and at the direction of the federal government.",0
2421,"U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday painted a dark and brutal portrait of American communities he said had been ravaged by gang violence as he pressed Congress to help him stop illegal immigration and boost deportations. Speaking to law enforcement officers in Brentwood, New York, on Long Island, Trump highlighted his push to crack down on members of the Mara Salvatrucha gang, better known as MS-13, whose existence the White House blames on lax enforcement of illegal immigration from Central America. “They don’t like shooting people because it’s too quick. ... They like to knife them and cut them because that way it’s more painful,” Trump said, flanked on stage by about 100 uniformed officers. He repeatedly referred to gang members as “animals” and “thugs.” Critics blasted Trump for using language that they said dehumanized immigrants and for seemingly advocating rough treatment of people arrested for crimes. “Please don’t be too nice,” Trump told the officers. “Like when you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head, you know, the way you put their hand over? ... I said, you can take the hand away, OK?” Jeffery Robinson, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, said that Trump’s remarks run counter to the American ideal that a person is “innocent until proven guilty.” “By encouraging police to dole out extra pain at will, the president is urging a kind of lawlessness that already imperils the health and lives of people of color at shameful rates,” Robinson said in a statement. Friday’s trip gave the president an opportunity to showcase some progress on his agenda even as his push to overhaul healthcare failed in Congress - and some respite from a power struggle among his senior staff that blew up on Thursday.] Trump urged Congress to appropriate more money for immigration agents and judges, and to give them more authority to quickly deport people from Central America who cross the border illegally. While Trump thanked various administration officials and local lawmakers for their work on the gang issue, he did not mention his attorney general, Jeff Sessions. Sessions was in El Salvador to promote the administration’s fight against gangs. The MS-13 gang first took root in the United States in Los Angeles in the 1980s in neighborhoods populated with immigrants from El Salvador who had fled its civil war. The Justice Department has said MS-13 has more than 10,000 members across the United States. In Brentwood, about 30 miles (50 km) east of New York City, MS-13 was behind the murders of two teenage girls last September and four young men in a park in April, authorities said. There have been 17 murders on Long Island tied to the gang since January 2016, according to the Suffolk County Police Department. Under Trump, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has targeted the gang, deporting more than 2,700 criminal gang members in fiscal 2017, up from 2,057 in the entire previous fiscal year, the White House has said. Trump made concerns about illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign. His administration is taking a harder line on Central American youth who have crossed the border illegally without guardians - a group that law enforcement has said has been targeted for recruitment by MS-13. Immigration agents plan to target teenagers who are suspected gang members, even if they are not charged with any crime, according to a memo seen by OutletName. But civil rights groups say police and immigration agents have unfairly targeted some teenagers. The New York Civil Liberties Union said at least nine minors have been placed in immigration detention due to unconfirmed allegations of gang affiliation by the Suffolk County Police Department. The department and ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cases. People claiming they were mistakenly included in gang databases and then targeted for deportation have filed at least two lawsuits, said Paromita Shah of the National Immigration Project at the National Lawyers Guild.",0
844,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday praised Miami-Dade County as a model for local cooperation on immigration enforcement, while blasting Chicago for its continued defiance of the Trump administration’s immigration agenda.
In a speech at the Port of Miami on Wednesday afternoon, Sessions will draw a sharp distinction between Miami-Dade, which earlier this year reversed its “sanctuary city” policy, and Chicago, which last week sued the administration for attaching new immigration detention requirements to federal law enforcement grants.
“Miami-Dade is an example of what is possible through hard work and a rededication to the rule of law,” Sessions plans to say, according to speech excerpts provided to reporters. “It is proof that the entire nation can do better.”
As for Chicago, Sessions says the city’s immigration policies are “just one sad example” of local politicians protecting lawbreakers at the expense of public safety.
“Respect for the rule of law has broken down [in Chicago],” he says.
The Miami-Dade county commission voted in February to drop its sanctuary status and boost cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Jail officials had previously honored ICE immigration detention requests only in cases where criminal aliens had been arrested for violent crimes. The revised policy expanded cooperation to all ICE detainers, regardless of the underlying criminal offense.
Miami-Dade officials defended the move, which angered many in the heavily Hispanic and immigrant county, as a necessary measure to guarantee continued access to federal community policing grants. In an Aug. 4 letter to Mayor Carlos Gimenez, the Department of Justice said “there was no evidence” Miami-Dade was out of compliance with an immigration-related conditions on a $480,000 grant due to the county this year.
Chicago, on the other hand, has staked out a position as one of the nation’s most unapologetic sanctuary cities. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration’s tough approach to immigration enforcement and vowed to maintain Chicago’s longtime sanctuary city status.
On Aug. 7, the city asked a federal judge to prevent DOJ from enforcing new immigration guidelines attached to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program.
During his remarks in Miami, Sessions will tie Chicago’s sanctuary policies to its soaring murder rate, which has reached levels not seen for 20 years. In contrast, Miami-Dade’s willingness to assist immigration officials has made the county much safer, he argues.
“I know that Miami-Dade will be an example of the good that comes from following the law,” Sessions says. “We have already seen that: the same Independence Day weekend when Chicago suffered more than 100 shootings and 15 homicides, Miami-Dade also had a historic number of shooting deaths — zero.”",1
107,"In an exclusive interview on OutletName' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday night affirmed that the White House would reject any Democratic spending bill without funding for a border wall.
The vice president added that President Trump ""is in the process of evaluating"" whether to remove troops from Afghanistan, and vowed that the military's withdrawal from Syria will be conducted in an ""orderly fashion.""
Pence's comments came as the new House majority, which was sworn in earlier Thursday, debated an interim, stopgap spending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8. The bill, which was ultimately approved late Thursday by a 239 to 192 vote, does not include any new wall money, and Senate Republicans and the White House have both described it as a non-starter that will never become law. Five Republicans voted for the bill.
Another piece of legislation approved by the House late Thursday would fund six of the seven unresolved spending bills through Sept. 30. The bill was approved by a 241-190 vote at approximately 10 p.m. ET, with seven Republicans joining Democrats to vote yea. The measure, which the White House has also said will not become law, puts together six of the seven unresolved appropriations bills in one package.
""Democrats broke off negotiations about a week ago, but the president’s made it clear: We’re here to make a deal, but it’s a deal that’s going to result in achieving real gains on border security,"" Pence said. ""And, you have no border security without a wall. We will have no deal without a wall.
""What we’ve completely focused on is keeping the president’s promise, to build a wall, to pass legislation that provides other support for border security, that gives the people that are enforcing our laws at the border, and across the border -- enforcing our immigration laws, the resources and the tools that they need.""
The vice president pointed to a compromise floated during a legislative showdown over the summer, which would have provided enhanced statutory protections to so-called ""Dreamers,"" or illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. at a young age. The president had signaled support for the measure.
""There’s a lot of people talking about a lot of different ideas, you know frankly, the better part of a year ago, the president expressed a willingness to deal with the issue of Dreamers in a compassionate way,"" Pence said. ""People who were brought here as children, and through no fault of their own -- he’s discussed that, it’s being talked about.""
While U.S. authorities ""actually saw a decline in illegal immigration and incursions on our southern border"" in the early days of Trump's presidency, Pence said, ""in the last 12 months we’ve literally seen a dramatic increase ... 2,000 people a day [are] apprehended at our border or found to be inadmissible, trying to enter our country.""
The solution, Pence said, is a ""barrier,"" along with ""technology, drones, the kind of support that our border agents know will assist them in doing their job. But bottom line, if there’s no wall, there’s no deal.""
""But bottom line: If there’s no wall, there’s no deal."" — Vice President Mike Pence
Separately, Pence suggested that Trump's planned pullout from Syria was appropriate because terrorists there have been defeated -- but, he added, the fight against the Islamic State terror network will continue.
""The reality is we have defeated ISIS, we have defeated the caliphate,"" Pence said. ""And, what the president announced just before Christmas is not that we’re giving up on the fight of ISIS; we’re going to continue to lean into the fight on ISIS.""
Speaking to OutletName on Wednesday, Retired Army Col. Douglas MacGregor praised Trump's decision, saying U.S. overseas commitments have been a ""disaster"" for everyday Americans.
However, several top Republicans, including South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, have said Trump's initially planned 30-day pullout was too hasty. After speaking with Trump this week, Graham said that the president has agreed to slow the drawdown.
Asked whether Trump would similarly pursue an Afghanistan withdrawal, as he has reportedly been debating, Pence said only that the idea was under active consideration.
The potential maneuver would involve more than 3,000 U.S. troops getting pulled out, a senior U.S. official told OutletName in December. There are 15,000 troops currently on the ground in Afghanistan.
""Well, the president is in the process of evaluating that, as we speak,"" Pence said. ""I was in Afghanistan last year. In his speech in August, President Trump, basically through new rules of engagement, new resources, additional military personnel, gave our folks on the ground the ability to take the fight, be at the tip of the spear, supporting the Afghan National Army in the battle against the Taliban, ISIS, Khorasan, Al Qaeda, re-emerging in Afghanistan.""",1
2415,"President Donald Trump said he would seek to keep his tough immigration enforcement policies from harming the U.S. farm industry and its largely immigrant workforce, according to farmers and officials who met with him. At a roundtable on farm labor at the White House last month, Trump said he did not want to create labor problems for farmers and would look into improving a program that brings in temporary agricultural workers on legal visas. “He assured us we would have plenty of access to workers,” said Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, one of 14 participants at the April 25 meeting with Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue. During the roundtable conversation about agriculture, farmers and representatives of the sector brought up labor and immigration, the details of which have not been previously reported. Some farmers told Trump they often cannot find Americans willing to do the difficult farm jobs, according to interviews with nine of the 14 participants. They said they were worried about stricter immigration enforcement and described frustrations with the H-2A visa program, the one legal way to bring in temporary seasonal agricultural workers. The White House declined to comment on the specifics of the discussion, but described the meeting as “very productive.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture did not respond to a request for comment on the April meeting. About half of U.S. crop workers are in the country illegally and more than two-thirds are foreign born, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Department of Labor’s National Agriculture Workers’ Survey. During the roundtable, Luke Brubaker, a dairy farmer from Pennsylvania, described how immigration agents had recently picked up half a dozen chicken catchers working for a poultry transportation company in his county. The employer tried to replace them with local hires, but within three hours all but one had quit, Brubaker told the gathering at the White House. Trump said he wanted to help and asked Secretary Perdue to look into the issues and come back with recommendations, according to the accounts. While other issues such as trade, infrastructure and technology were also discussed, participants were more positive after the meeting about the conversation on foreign labor “than about anything else we talked about,” said Bill Northey, a farmer and Iowa’s secretary of agriculture. RED TAPE
Tom Demaline, president of Willoway Nurseries in Ohio, said he told the president about his struggles with the H-2A guestworker program, which he has used for 18 years. He told Trump the program works in concept, but not in practice. “I brought up the bureaucracy and red tape,” he said. “If the guys show up a week or two late, it puts crops in jeopardy. You are on pins and needles all year to make sure you get the workers and do everything right.” While use of the program has steadily increased over the past decade, it still accounts for only about 10 percent of the estimated 1.3 million farmworkers in the country, according to government data. In 2016, the government granted 134,000 H-2A visas Employers who import workers with H-2A visas must provide free transportation to and from the United States as well as housing and food for workers once they arrive. Wage minimums are set by the government and are often higher than farmers are used to paying. Steve Scaroni, whose company Fresh Harvest brings in thousands of foreign H-2A workers for growers in California’s Central valley, says, however, that he could find work for even more people if he had more places to house them. Trump recently signed another executive order titled “Buy American, Hire American,” calling for changes to a program granting temporary visas for the tech industry, but not to visas used by farmers and other seasonal businesses, including Trump’s own resorts. FARMER CONCERNS
Trump also signed two executive orders, just days after taking office, focused on border security that called for arresting more people in the United States illegally and speeding up deportations. Roundtable participants said that many farmers have worried about the effect of the stepped up enforcement on their workforce, but Trump told them his administration was focused on deporting criminals, not farmworkers. “He has a much better understanding about this than some of the rhetoric we have seen,” said meeting attendee Steve Troxler, North Carolina’s agriculture commissioner and a farmer himself. The farmers at the meeting said they stressed to the president the need for both short-term and permanent workers. They said there should be a program to help long-time farmworkers without criminal records, but who are in the country illegally, to become legal residents. Last Tuesday, Democrats in the House and Senate said they would introduce a bill to give farmworkers who have worked illegally in the country for two consecutive years a “blue card” to protect them from deportation. Brubaker, the Pennsylvania farmer, said he liked what he had heard about the bill and hoped it would get the president’s support to make it a bipartisan effort. “The administration has got something started here,” he said of the meeting with farm leaders. “It’s about time something happens.”",0
2345,"Mexico's new President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador campaigned to protect the human rights of migrants.
Lopez Obrador, who took office Dec. 1, vowed not to do the ""dirty work"" of the United States after President Donald Trump demanded Mexico stop migrant caravans before they reach the southern U.S. border.
But a series of increasingly tough actions in Mexico suggest Lopez Obrador has turned his back on those promises and is tacitly cooperating with the Trump administration to stop the flow of Central American migrants passing through Mexico to seek asylum in the U.S.
In Tijuana, immigrant advocates have accused the Lopez Obrador administration of accommodating the Trump administration's new ""Remain in Mexico"" program despite publicly claiming the U.S. acted unilaterally. The program forces asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico while their asylum claims are pending in the United States. It has drawn legal challenges from multiple groups in the U.S. who contend the program violates the law and puts migrants in danger.
In January, Mexican officials, apparently acting under pressure from the U.S., denied entry to two U.S. attorneys who provided legal advice to asylum-seekers, and also refused entry to several journalists who had photographed the large migrant caravan that arrived in Tijuana in November.
Mexican federal immigration authorities recently arrested and deported several people who had been helping coordinate migrant caravans as they passed through Mexico on their way toward the U.S.
On Feb. 15, videos posted on social media showed police shoving and punching migrants outside a shelter in Mexico City. In denouncing the incident, human-rights groups called the incident part of a growing ""pattern of harassment"" by various levels of the government against ""human rights defenders"" and migrants seeking to organize themselves.
Most recently, when about 2,000 migrants who traveled in the latest caravan arrived in Piedras Negras, hoping to cross the border and seek asylum in Eagle Pass, Texas, Mexican authorities responded by holding them in a makeshift shelter surrounded by a fence and armed officers. Then they dispersed the migrants by bus to other parts of the border.
Some say recent actions suggest Lopez Obrador is coordinating with U.S.
The recent actions in Piedras Negras and other parts of Mexico seem to show that the Lopez Obrador administration is working closely with the Trump administration to help the United States block migrants from asking for asylum in the U.S., despite the Mexican president's promises to stand up to Trump, said David Shirk, a professor of political science and international relations at the University of San Diego.
“These two governments have decided that, despite very significant policy differences and ideological orientations, they have essentially opted for an alliance of convenience in what arguably otherwise under previous presidents would clearly be a major crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border” David Shirk, University of San Diego professor of political science and international relations
Shirk also noted that Lopez Obrador has refrained from criticizing Trump's declaration of a national emergency to fund the construction of additional barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, which Shirk said will push migrants to take more dangerous treks.
""These two governments have decided that, despite very significant policy differences and ideological orientations, they have essentially opted for an alliance of convenience in what arguably otherwise under previous presidents would clearly be a major crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border,"" Shirk said. ""... If this were happening in the 1980s, Mexican presidents would express very public outrage.""
In doing the United States' bidding on immigration, Lopez Obrador, appears to be trying to avoid a confrontation with the Trump administration in order to focus on domestic issues he views as more pressing, such as battling inequality, corruption and violence, Shirk said.
""It allows him to focus on his actual policy priorities without getting dragged into a prolonged and potentially very dangerous conflict with the Trump administration,"" Shirk said. ""Unfortunately, the losers, the downside, is that thousands of (migrants) are having their lives placed in jeopardy by acquiescing to Trump administration border policies.""
Expert: Lopez Obrador not upfront about 'Remain in Mexico' cooperation
Lopez Obrador has not been upfront about the ways his administration is seemingly cooperating with the Trump administration's border policies, said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University and an expert on U.S.-Mexico relations.
The Trump administration's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy has essentially turned Mexico into a dumping ground for asylum-seekers, she said.
""It seems like the Mexican government has not been honest with the Mexican people"" about what sort of agreement it has with the United States over the treatment of migrants, she said.
“It seems like the Mexican government has not been honest with the Mexican people” Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, George Mason University professor
But she is critical of groups such as Pueblo Sin Fronteras, which has helped coordinate migrants into caravans as they pass through Mexico bound for the U.S.
Organizers say they help coordinate caravans because traveling in large groups is safer for migrants at risk of being preyed upon by criminals and corrupted officials.
But Correa-Cabrera believes the groups are using migrants for political purposes, something Pueblo Sin Fronteras has denied.
Nevertheless, the caravans, she said, have made it difficult for Lopez Obrador's administration to implement more welcoming policies.
""The Mexican government said, 'Yes, they are going to deal with this in a different way,' but they were not expecting caravans and caravans and caravans,"" she said.
At the same time, the caravans have played into Trump's political hands, she said, by providing justification for his border wall and other border policies aimed at deterring migrant families and unaccompanied minors — mostly from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala — from making the trip north to the United States.
""Who is stuck in the middle? The migrants,"" she said.
Others say Lopez Obrador still committed to helping migrants
Some human-rights advocates believe Lopez Obrador remains committed to his campaign promises to be more welcoming to migrants.
In January, the Lopez Obrador administration offered to provide humanitarian visas after a new migrant caravan from Central America crossed into Mexico.
The program showed a different attitude towards asylum-seekers than the previous government, said Maureen Meyer, of the Washington Office on Latin America, a human-rights advocacy group.
However, Mexico was forced to shut down the program after more than 12,000 people applied.
Ending the program highlighted how the Lopez Obrador administration has struggled to reconcile more welcoming policies with the challenges Mexico faces dealing with the rising number of migrant caravans entering Mexico. The caravans are made up largely of Central American migrants fleeing poverty and violence.
“I think that is extremely concerning because no one should be denied entry into a country when they are working to promote human rights of others.” Maureen Meyer, of the Washington Office on Latin America
""I think there is a will from a lot of Mexican officials to do things differently, but they lack the resources to do things differently, and they are trying to enact significant changes while at the same time addressing large flows of people in caravans,"" said Maureen Meyer, of the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group. ""It's a challenge they have not quite effectively been able to address.""
Those challenges, Meyer said, have been compounded by the Trump administration's unilateral policies forcing ""hundreds and thousands of people to be stuck in Mexican border towns"" awaiting appointments to ask for asylum or after they were sent back while they wait for their asylum claims to be processed in courts.
At the same time, Meyer has been alarmed by several recent actions taken by the Mexican government seemingly under pressure by the United States, notably refusing entry to asylum lawyers and journalists.
""I think that is extremely concerning because no one should be denied entry into a country when they are working to promote human rights of others,"" she said.
Meyer said she was also concerned about reports of migrants being abused by police and caravan organizers being deported.
If the Lopez Obrador administration really wants to be recognized as a government that respects migrants’ rights and is intolerant of abuse, she said, then it must investigate the multiple allegations of abuse that have occurred in recent months, sanction those responsible, and clarify the criteria it is using to deny entry of select lawyers, journalists and others ""working to support asylum seekers and members of the caravans.""",0
1283,"Shortly after starting their midafternoon shift, Border Patrol agents Timothy McNeil and Jason Pope got their first 911 call: a 27-year-old Mexican man had been walking in the desert for 10 days and needed help. The agents, both part of the elite Border Patrol Search, Trauma and Rescue unit, found Manuel Gutierrez Lopez in a tangle of mesquite trees about 30 miles west of Tucson and some 70 miles north of the border. Mr. Gutierrez, who had called 911 on his cellphone, told them he got separated from a group of eight or nine others a few days before and had been without water for at least two days. The temperature showed 104 degrees in Mr. McNeil’s truck when the call came in last week just after 3:30 p.m. Over more than an hour and a half, they gave Mr. Gutierrez water, Capri Sun fruit-drink pouches and a granola bar, and administered three saline IVs. When his vital signs were stable, they handed him off to a contractor in a van who would take him to the Border Patrol station, book him, and transfer him to a holding cell until he could either be sent home or released into the U.S. with a future court date. Of the many ways migrants end up in Border Patrol custody, this is among the most desperate. The unit of 200 agents called BORSTAR stationed along the border are all trained EMTs, and they rescue people who are stranded in the mountains, caught in swift moving water, in medical need, or dial 911, a call people tend to make only in the most dire state, the agents say. Mr. McNeil is also a paramedic. Mr. Gutierrez was a fairly typical rescue, the agents said, and one of more than 584 in the Tucson area since the start of the government’s fiscal year in October. In the same period a year ago, agents made 641 rescues. Messrs. Pope and McNeil work in a team of about 40 agents. Mr. McNeil said he is worried that more people will die trying to make the crossing as summer temperatures rise, including some of the record number of children making the journey. Twelve children have died crossing the U.S.-Mexico border so far this year, more than in any full year since at least 2014, according to the International Organization for Migration. Some, like nearly 2-year-old Valeria Ramirez, who appeared alongside her father in a photo that spread globally last week, drown while trying to cross the Rio Grande in Texas. Others have died in the desert heat. The danger of crossing the border illegally is one of the reasons lawmakers cite in calling for policy changes. Immigrant advocates say it reflects the overflow of people at the border trying to ask for asylum at legal ports of entry, where there can be backlogs of weeks or months. More families are crossing the border, compared with previous years when migrants were mostly single men, adding to the number of rescues for BORSTAR agents. Between January and May, nearly 282,000 migrants traveling as families were apprehended at the border, more than in any prior full year, along with 41,300 unaccompanied minors. “Nothing is normal. My biggest fear is that we run short of volunteers and we run out of water,” said Eddie Canales, director of the South Texas Human Rights Project, which provides aid to migrants who travel from Mexico into the U.S. Threatened with tariffs from the U.S., Mexico recently agreed to enforce its border with Guatemala. The country now has less than a month to contain surging migration from Central America. OutletName’s Santiago Perez travels to southern Mexico to see the effects of increased border enforcement.

Most illegal immigrants are from Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador. Upon arriving in the U.S., they typically surrender to the first border agent they find and request asylum, starting a process that often lets them stay in the U.S. for years while their claim is adjudicated amid long court delays. BORSTAR agents say the people they treat typically don’t protest when they are handed off to other border agents. Mr. McNeil said BORSTAR agents spend about half the year training. The summer is considered their “operations seasons,” when agents will be dispatched to help migrants on a nearly daily basis. In some cases agents respond directly to 911 calls, other times they are sent into the desert after someone reports a missing migrant. Six-year-old Gurupreet Kaur left with her mother from India and then traveled for months, ultimately crossing Mexico into the U.S., said Deepak Ahluwalia, the mother’s attorney. The two planned to join Gurupreet’s father in New York City, where he has been living since 2013 after requesting asylum. After their smuggler directed them to cross into the Arizona desert on a scorching hot June day when temperatures reached 108 degrees, the mother, identified as S. Kaur, set out to find water and left her daughter with a fellow traveler. Ms. Kaur ended up finding Border Patrol agents to whom she surrendered almost 22 hours after being dropped off by the smuggler, U.S. Border Patrol Agent Jesus Vasavilbaso said. About four hours later, Border Patrol agents found Gurupreet’s body. She had died from hyperthermia in the intense desert heat, according to the Pima County Medical Examiner in Tucson. Mr. Pope was among the BORSTAR agents dispatched to find another mother and children missing after Gurupreet’s mother was found. The missing migrants were found a day later and treated for dehydration. Mr. Pope said the desert in that area is remote and as rugged as any in the area. “I’m a father myself and when it’s a kid, it’s just…” Mr. Pope said, his voice trailing off. Other recent child deaths include two infants and a toddler whose bodies, along with that of a woman in her 20s, were found near a busy border crossing spot of thick brush just beyond the Rio Grande on June 23. The morning the bodies were found, the National Weather Service issued a heat advisory for the area. Border Patrol officials said Saturday that a 43-year-old Salvadoran man died at a hospital after collapsing at a border station. He had crossed the border near McAllen, Texas, with his daughter about a week before. Officials have asked that the girl quickly be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services and placed in migrant youth shelter until a sponsor in the U.S. can be found, an official said. More than 7,500 people are known to have died crossing the border with Mexico since 1998, according to U.S. government data. So far this year, the remains of about 67 people have been found in the same desert county where Gurupreet died. During the same period last year, 61 people died, said Dr. Gregory Hess, chief medical examiner for Pima County, Ariz. “Regardless of your immigration status, life is the priority,” Mr. Pope said as he treated Mr. Gutierrez. “The other stuff can wait.”",0
423,"President Donald Trump warned Americans that Congressional Democrats were preparing to shut down the government over amnesty for illegal immigrants.
“The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security,” Trump wrote on Twitter.
His comments followed a blowup of a potential DACA amnesty deal with Democrats, which he blamed on “Dicky Durbin” leaking details of a private meeting he had with senators.
Trump warned that a government shutdown would severely hurt the military “at a time we need it more than ever.”
He also called for a merit-based immigration system, a plan to get rid of the lottery visa program, and most importantly the wall on the southern border.
“We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER, and we must have a great WALL to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!” he wrote on Twitter.

52,"If an army marches on its stomach, the forces at Fort Hamilton had better learn to cook. Eateries near the Brooklyn Army base, which handed over an undocumented pizza deliveryman to immigration agents last week, are now refusing to send their own workers into the garrison. “I won’t send my guys there anymore,” said Josefina Cardoso, owner of the El Puente restaurant in Bay Ridge. “I would feel guilty if something happened.” Cardoso, 45, a U.S. citizen born in Mexico, said she’d make the delivery herself if she had to — but other workers at the taco joint want to boycott the base over its treatment of Ecuadorian immigrant Pablo Villavicencio. “Some people tell their bosses ‘I’m not going,’ ” said cook and delivery guy Emanuel Kabrinny, 34. “I’m not going either. If they want food, let them come here [to pick it up].” Villavicencio, 35, wound up in immigration detention Friday after dropping off Italian food at the base — where officials refused to accept his IDNYC card as identification and then ran a background check, revealing he has an outstanding deportation order from 2010. Base officials told the press the father of two signed “a waiver” for the background check — but he says that is “a lie.” “I am 100 percent sure that I did not sign any document there,” Villavicencio told The New York Post in a phone interview from immigration detention. The manager of the Queens pizzeria where Villavicencio works said one guard just “had it out for him.” “That’s what this is all about,” the manager of Nonna Delia’s in College Point, who wouldn’t give his name, said. Other local delivery guys said the guards rarely check for any ID. “They don’t ask us for ID,” said Juan Salvador, 38, an immigrant from Guatemala who delivers for Fourth Avenue deli Goustaro. But his manager said she, too, is now afraid to send undocumented food couriers into the federal facility. “We’re kind of afraid to send someone to the Army base this morning, and what’s the first call? From the Army base,” said Chris Moustakas, 35, a manager of the family-owned bagel joint. Meanwhile, Villavicencio’s possible deportation has turned into a political football ahead of the upcoming state primary, with Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday offering him free legal representation. “Detaining a hardworking man, separating a father from his children and tearing apart communities doesn’t make America safe, and a wrong-minded immigration policy grounded in bias and cruelty doesn’t make America great,” Cuomo said of the married father of two young girls.",1
73,"The other day I watched a group of young lefties protest the Trump administration’s immigration policies. They were carrying Mexican flags and screaming: ""Si, se puede!"" Yes we can.  ""Si, se puede"" is now the rallying cry of the no-borders left, but it wasn’t always. The slogan first became famous fifty years ago, thanks to Cesar Chavez, founder of the United Farm Workers union. When Chavez said ""Si, se puede,"" he meant something very different: ""yes, we can seal the borders."" Cesar Chavez hated immigration. He was Hispanic and left wing, but he called illegal Mexican immigrants ""wetbacks,"" and fought to keep them out of the country. He understood that peasants from Latin America will always work for less than Americans will. That’s why employers prefer them. Immigration undercut his members’ wages and weakened the union. ""As long as we have a poor country bordering California,"" Chavez once explained, ""it’s going to be very difficult to win strikes."" In 1969, Chavez led a march down the center of California to protest the hiring of immigrant produce pickers. Marching alongside him was Senator Walter Mondale, and the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, the longtime aide to Martin Luther King. It didn’t seem strange at the time. Liberals still cared about working class wages.  Years later, Chavez dispatched armed union members into the desert to assault Mexican nationals who were trying to sneak across the border. Chavez’s men beat immigrants with chains and whips made of barbed wire. Illegal aliens who dared to work as scabs had their houses bombed and cars burned. The union paid Mexican officials to keep quiet. Chavez wasn’t embarrassed about any of this. He bragged about it.  In California, Chavez remains a progressive hero. There’s a state holiday named after him, and at least 25 public schools. Chavez’s life is a reminder of how much the left has changed, and how quickly. For a century, many Democrats agreed with Chavez. They opposed mass immigration because they believed it hurt American workers. As a factual matter, they were right. One study, conducted after the 1980 Mariel boatlift in Miami, found that high school educated Americans saw their wages fall by more than a third after large numbers of Cuban refugees arrived. If you believe in supply and demand, this isn’t surprising.  Even liberals understood the principle. After the fall of Saigon in1975, Governor Jerry Brown opposed letting Vietnamese refugees into California, on the grounds that the state already had enough poor people. As Brown put it at the time, ""There is something a little strange about saying, 'Let's bring in 500,000 more people' when we can't take care of the one million Californians out of work."" Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware agreed; he introduced federal legislation to curb the arrival of the Vietnamese. Even George McGovern, maybe the most liberal Democrat in the Senate, opposed bringing more refugees into the country. ""I think the Vietnamese are better off in Vietnam,"" McGovern said.  Two decades later, leading Democrats were still wary of mass immigration. As Bill Clinton put it in his 1995 state of the union address, ""The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by US citizens or immigrants. The public services they use impose burdens on our taxpayers."" No prominent Democrat could say anything like that today without being denounced as racist. Clinton got a standing ovation. As late as 2006, there were still liberals who cared about the economic effects of immigration. ""Immigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants,"" explained economist Paul Krugman in the OutletName. ""We’ll need to reduce the inflow of low-skill immigrants."" That same year, Hillary Clinton voted for a fence on the Mexican border. So did Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, and 23 other Senate Democrats. But that was the last gasp of a dying elite consensus. Twenty years after Bill Clinton told Americans they had the right to be upset about illegal immigration, his wife scolded the country for enforcing border controls. The 2016 Democratic platform demanded that all illegal immigrants living in the United States be, ""incorporated completely into our society through legal processes."" It was now Democratic Party orthodoxy not simply to let illegal aliens stay in the country, but to let them vote.  What changed? Not the economics of immigration. Supply and demand remained in effect. Predictably, as the country admitted more impoverished immigrants, its own middle class shrunk, becoming a minority of the population in 2015. But Democrats stopped caring. Why? Here’s the short answer, in four simple facts: One: There are likely more than 22 million illegal aliens within our borders.  Two: Democrats plan to give them all citizenship. It’s in their platform.  Three: Studies show the overwhelming majority of first-time immigrant voters vote Democrat.  Four: The biggest landslide in American presidential history was only 17 million votes.  Do the math. The payoff for Democrats is obvious: a permanent electoral majority and total control of the country for generations.  That’s the point, no matter what they tell you. From their perspective, it’s well worth destroying the middle class. ",1
846,"Michael Flynn Jr., son of former National Security Advisor Lt Gen Michael Flynn, responded via Twitter to OutletName co-host Geraldo Rivera’s emotional defense of migrants who stormed the U.S. Mexico border on Sunday.
In a Monday afternoon “The Five” segment, Rivera responded to a question from co-host Jesse Watters about media dishonesty on the subject by stating his refusal “to deal with this as a media issue, because it’s far too important.”
“This is something that goes to the very quick,” said an emotional Geraldo. “This goes to my soul. Fulfilling my role as the designated piñata on OutletName, I wanna say I am ashamed. This tear gas choked me. We treat these people — these economic refugees — as if they’re zombies from ‘The Walking Dead.’ I think we arrested 42 people, eight of them were women with children! We have to deal with this problem humanely and with compassion! These are not invaders. Stop using these military analogies. This is absolutely painful to watch!”
After asserting that the migrants were only coming “because they want a job,” Rivera essentially accused people of suspending their humanity on the issue “because they look different than the mainstream.”
Co-host Greg Gutfeld responded by contending that the migrants were “being manipulated by a political group, an activist group.” “Now imagine if a group of activists hypnotized a bunch of people to rob a bank,” said Gutfeld. “To go in and rush the bank. It’s not the security guard’s fault that he has to protect the bank.”
The discussion on “The Five” continued, with the other cohosts showing respect for Geraldo’s position despite their disagreement, but in Twitter-world, Flynn Jr. didn’t hold back.
“Geraldo’s sympathy for these ‘migrants’ always seems one-sided,” Flynn Jr. tweeted. “What about sympathy for CBP who had rocks thrown at them? Or sympathy for the AMERICAN TAXPAYER having to continue and fund the absolute MESS that is our immigration system?”

253,"While they are gallivanting around Puerto Rico, President Trump sits in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come to the table to end the longest partial government shutdown in history.
Hi, I’m Tomi and it’s time for First Thoughts.
When the cameras are on, Chuck, Nancy and the rest of the Democrats whine and complain about the government shutdown BUT behind closed doors and in tropical paradise their fellow Democrats seem to be living it up quite nicely.

Now it’s not just one or two, mind you. About 30 of our favorite wall-hating Democrats took off for Puerto Rico in a chartered-jet last weekend!
With families and lobbyists in tow, they even planned to take in a special performance of the Broadway hit, ""Hamilton!""
Wow, sounds like they are really taking this shutdown seriously! Though I can understand why they don’t seem to care, they are still getting paid and have plenty of cash left over to stay in a seaside resort where a room cost over $400 a night.
I wonder if the over 800,000 government workers -- who have not been paid due to the partial shutdown -- can afford such a luxury vacay! Kinda doubt it.
Yet, the excuse will likely be this is Trump’s shutdown, his fault- so why not party it up in Puerto Rico with the lobbyists, right?
Well, while they are having some sunny fun, President Trump sits in snowy D.C. ready to make a deal. In fact, he’s been working for weeks.
And guess what… though he’s ready to make a deal..he’s not caving on the border wall! So I suggest these Democrats take a break from their undeserved break and get back to reality -- the reality that we need to finish the wall!
Now I hope he doesn’t have to declare a State of Emergency. I hope it doesn’t come to that BUT with over 10 million illegal immigrants living in this country and thousands more on the way- it is an emergency.
President Trump brought something up in his Oval Office Address that I wish more Americans would understand, illegal immigration impacts us all BUT it impacts minority and inner-city communities the MOST!
Here's some of what he said, ""But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans.""
Where do you think these illegal immigrants and their children are going to end up? I can tell you this much, it’s not going to be in Nancy Pelosi’s backyard in swanky Pacific Heights. It’s not going to be in the Hollywood Hills, or Malibu or anywhere like that.
They’re going to end up in already underserved communities and in already overcrowded classrooms, bus stations and housing developments.
As a country, we have a right to regulate how many immigrants come in and from where. Illegal immigrants ignoring our laws rob us all of that right.
Mr. President, hold firm. Even the anti-wall Americans will one day see why you did it and they’ll thank you for it.
Those are my First Thoughts. From LA, God bless and take care.

2101,"Students show their support for a proposed ordinance declaring Santa Ana, Calif, a sanctuary for all residents regardless of immigration status during a city council meeting Dec. 20, 2016. Donald Trump, with a little help from Congress, will have broad presidential powers to crack down on ""sanctuary cities"" that protect undocumented immigrants from his planned roundup and deportation of millions who are in the country illegally.
In what could become a major conflict between the new president and local governments, the showdown likely will result in legal challenges testing how far the White House can go in dictating its priorities.
Trump will be armed with a range of powerful options, including federal lawsuits and the power to withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in grants that states and cities rely on.
""The Trump administration can largely get the results it is seeking and a real meaningful end to most of these sanctuary policies through a combination of carrots and sticks,"" said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, who has advised the Trump transition team on its immigration enforcement options. ""The point is not to go around whacking all these little cities and counties, it's to get them to do the right thing. And for the die-hards, to confront them.""
Local communities are digging in for the fight. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel created a task force to help undocumented immigrants and pledged $1 million for a legal defense fund. ""Chicago always will be a sanctuary city,"" he said.
The term ""sanctuary city"" describes up to 300 communities that have a range of policies protecting the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.
Some cities — including San Francisco, Chicago and New York — proudly declare themselves sanctuaries and have enacted policies that prohibit municipal employees from turning over residents or information on them to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Other cities more narrowly restrict police from inquiring about the immigration status of detained suspects. There also are cities that work with federal immigration authorities but refuse to hold suspects in jail solely so ICE agents can pick them up.
Beyond city governments, institutions that include churches and universities vow to fight federal efforts to round up undocumented immigrants on their grounds.
Here are the two most powerful weapons the Trump administration will have to fight back:
LAWSUITS
If Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., one of the most outspoken critics of illegal immigration, is confirmed as attorney general, he will be able to sue cities on the grounds that they are violating federal law by refusing to cooperate with immigration enforcement. His confirmation hearing started Tuesday.
Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said that kind of lawsuit fits Trump's ""big and showy style,"" but the law is murky.
President Obama's Justice Department ruled last summer that local law enforcement agencies are required by federal law to at least share that information. However, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled in 2014 that local police departments are not required to hold undocumented immigrants for ICE.
""Justice could spend all of its time and resources going after these cases,"" Brown said.
GRANT MONEY
The two most likely federal agencies that could cut off funding are Justice and Homeland Security. They provide grants for local law enforcement agencies to hire officers; bolster prosecutions, courts and jails; provide drug treatment, prepare for terrorist attacks, and assist crime victims and witnesses.
The Trump administration has the power to cut off much of that funding. For example, Justice's State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, or SCAAP, distributed $165 million in 2015 to local agencies that detained undocumented immigrants in its jails.
Laurie Robinson, a former assistant attorney general under Presidents Clinton and Obama who headed the Office of Justice Programs, which oversees grants, said the statute implementing SCAAP gives an attorney general broad power to decide who gets money.
""They could cut off drug programs, domestic violence grants, violence against women grants,"" she said.
Other grants won't be as easy to end. Justice's Community Oriented Policing Services program distributed $208 million in 2015 to local agencies. But that money is distributed using a formula established by Congress, meaning an attorney general can't revoke grants without lawmakers' approval.
""Unless Congress were to change something, the executive branch cannot really decide on its own to cut off a grant that is by statute designated to go to a local jurisdiction,"" said Robinson, now a criminology professor at George Mason University.
Help won't be hard to find. Republicans in Congress, including Rep. Duncan Hunter of California and Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, have tried in recent years to pass laws establishing those kinds of cuts, but they always faced a veto threat from Obama. Republicans filed similar bills this week, and those have a far better chance of becoming law now that Republicans control both Congress and the White House.
Rosemary Jenks, director of government relations for NumbersUSA, which favors lower immigration levels, said it's impossible to know how nasty the fight will get over sanctuary cities given the raw emotions on both sides. ""I'm not going to rule anything out,"" she said.",0
2175,"Dozens of Catholic nuns, priests and lay people were arrested during a civil disobedience demonstration on Capitol Hill Tuesday. They want to see legislation that would protect immigrants currently protected under DACA from deportation. (Feb. 27) AP
Capitol Police arrest members of the Catholic community and supporters of DACA recipients during a protest in the Russell Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 27, 2018. Monday was supposed to be the day that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program officially came to an end, terminating deportation protections for nearly 700,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.
A Supreme Court ruling delayed that end date, possibly by as much as a year, but DACA enrollees are still using Monday to push Congress and the White House to pass a new law to grant them permanent protections.
From Nevada to Capitol Hill to Trump Tower in New York City, immigrants and their allies will hold marches, rallies and prayer vigils to make sure their plight remains in the spotlight. Because even though the Supreme Court bought them some time, that reprieve is only temporary.
A federal judge in California ruled in January that the Trump administration used flawed legal reasoning when it decided to end the Obama-era program, and ordered it to continue processing DACA renewals. The Department of Justice made a rare, direct request to the Supreme Court to hear the case, but the court ruled last week that the case must go through the regular appeals process.
That means the case now goes back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in California, which is expected to rule sometime this summer. The earliest the Supreme Court could accept that case would be in October, pushing a final ruling possibly into 2019.
The Department of Homeland Security must continue processing DACA renewal applications throughout that time. But that grace period also allowed Congress to push a DACA bill to the back of the line, arguing they no longer face the kind of pressure to pass a bill like they faced in recent months as the March 5 deadline approached.
While most DACA enrollees can breathe easy for the time being, there are still thousands at risk of being deported due to the back-and-forth over the status of the program.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services did not begin accepting DACA renewals until Jan. 13 following the California judge's ruling. That created a massive backlog of renewal applications, which can take three to five months for the agency to process.
A total of 13,090 DACA permits are due to expire in March, according to Citizenship and Immigration Services. Another 5,320 DACA permits expire in April and nearly 14,000 more in May.
That means tens of thousands of DACA enrollees may lose their DACA protections while they wait for their renewals to go through. And immigration advocates warn that they would be exposed to deportation if they are arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents during that time.
That fear is intensified by the fact that ICE has been arresting a higher number of undocumented immigrants who haven't committed any crimes beyond their immigration violations. Shortly after taking office, Trump changed the approach, allowing ICE agents to pick up any undocumented immigrants they encounter in their day-to-day lives. That was a sharp departure from the Obama administration, which focused on those with criminal records.
To qualify for DACA, created in 2012, DREAMers had to undergo a thorough background check, prove they arrived in the U.S. before their 16th birthday, were 30 or younger, were attending school or in the military, and had not committed a felony or serious misdemeanor. The program provided work permits and two-year reprieves from deportation that could be renewed.",0
2432,"President Donald Trump is ramping up calls on the U.S. Congress to stop legal immigrants from sponsoring extended family members who want to move to the United States, saying so-called “chain migration” poses a threat to national security. Even without legislative action, however, the number of immigrants approved for family-based visas has dropped this year to the lowest level in more than a decade, a OutletName review of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data shows. The drop has not been previously reported. The Trump administration has taken a series of measures to more closely scrutinize legal immigration. These steps have been overshadowed by Trump’s more public efforts to crack down on illegal immigration, such as his calls for a wall along the Mexican border and more arrests of people living in the country illegally. Lately though, Trump has increasingly been taking aim at chain migration, saying it allows a single immigrant “to bring in dozens of increasingly distant relations,” with “no real selection criteria.” He said a Bangladeshi man who set off a homemade pipe bomb in a crowded New York City commuter hub in December was a prime example of the dangers of the system. Immigration advocates counter that no one automatically qualifies for a visa because a relative is already in the United States. All immigrants undergo security vetting and can face years-long waits before they are given a green light. The intensified focus on chain migration has been accompanied by an overall slowdown in adjudications of family-based visas, known as I-130s, the OutletName review shows. The number of approvals dropped by nearly a quarter in the first nine months of 2017 to around 406,000 compared to the same period a year earlier when approvals were more than 530,000, despite a similar number of applications during both periods, USCIS data showed. The drop was even starker when looking only at I-130s approved for relatives who were not immediate family members. Those fell by 70 percent in the same period, from more than 108,000 in the first nine months of 2016 to 32,500 in the same period in 2017. The entire 2017 fiscal year had the lowest number of approvals for extended family visas since 2000. USCIS said that since there are a limited number of visas for this category, it prioritizes processing visas that are more immediately available. The agency also said there are normal year-to-year fluctuations in the number of visas that are filed and decided. At the core of the administration’s long-term policy goal is a belief that immigration should be merit-based. “Those people are just coming in based on connection to a family member,” the new director of USCIS, L. Francis Cissna said in a telephone interview, referring to chain migrants. “That lack of selectivity; it takes us away from where we want to go as a country.” Cissna said no specific policy guidance has been put in place at USCIS to change the way family-based visas are issued. He also said there were no plans to restrict visas for immediate family members and pointed out that approvals of visas and citizenship applications overall are still high. He has said, however, that his agency is looking closely at all visa categories to root out fraud. USCIS said separately that closer scrutiny could lead to longer processing times. For example, H-1B temporary work visas for high-skilled workers are facing more hurdles, and applications are receiving far more requests for evidence, slowing down the whole program, according to immigration lawyers and data provided by the government. [nL2N1LY0F5] USCIS has also put in place new interview requirements for U.S. citizens seeking to bring over their fiancés. In the first nine months of 2017, approvals of fiancé visas dropped by 35 percent over the same period a year earlier, the OutletName data review found. ‘ONTO THE MAIN STAGE’ Immigration supporters said any efforts by the administration to restrict the entry of family members of migrants was shortsighted. They “bring drive and entrepreneurial spirit to the United States,” said Steve Yale-Loehr, an immigration law expert at Cornell University. Chain migration has long been a target of groups that favor more restrictions on legal immigration. The idea, supported by organizations like NumbersUSA, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) and the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), failed to gain much traction at the highest levels of power in Washington before Trump took office. “We have been talking about this for a long time but we were kind of out there in the wilderness” said Ira Mehlman from FAIR. “It was never at this level of discussion before.” Now supporters of the ideas of restricting chain migration and tightening standards for legal immigration occupy key positions in the administration. They include Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who remains vocal on the issue, and his long-time aide Stephen Miller, who is now one of Trump’s closest policy advisers. The current USCIS ombudsman Julie Kirchner was previously the executive director of FAIR. The White House and the Department of Justice did not respond to questions about the influence of the groups, which critics say are anti-immigrant, on administration policy. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at CIS, said she and her colleagues “are in fairly regular contact with various administration officials as they solicit suggestions and ideas to improve policies.” She said she had also spoken to officials in the Obama administration, but only occasionally. Earlier this month NumbersUSA launched a national advertising campaign against chain migration. A day later the White House posted a presentation on the same subject making many of the same points. NumbersUSA director Roy Beck said any similarity in the points was just a coincidence. Still, he is thrilled that his group’s ideas on restricting legal immigration have been “catapulted onto the main stage in an unprecedented way,” he said in an interview. In April, Trump signed an executive order directing agencies to draft new rules and guidance for the legal immigration system. In August, the White House backed the RAISE Act, proposed legislation sponsored by two Republican lawmakers, that aimed to cut legal immigration by 50 percent over 10 years.",0
2260,"President Eisenhower sent federal troops to enforce school desegregation in Little Rock over the Arkansas governor's opposition. Sessions is warning California on immigration.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions Is California the next Little Rock? Recent statements by Attorney General Jeff Sessions suggest that it might be.
Last week I wrote about folks in California who want to split the state in various ways. But no sooner was that published than Sessions put California on notice in a blistering speech that invoked the American Civil War.
""I understand that we have a wide variety of political opinions out there on immigration. But the law is in the books and its purpose is clear,"" Sessions told the California Peace Officers' Association on Wednesday. ""There is no nullification. There is no secession. Federal law is 'the supreme law of the land.' I would invite any doubters to Gettysburg, and to the graves of John C. Calhoun and Abraham Lincoln.""
Sessions’ stern warning was prompted by California laws designed to frustrate the enforcement of federal immigration laws, as inspired by the “Sanctuary City” movement.
The attorney general has filed a lawsuit challenging three California laws: one prohibiting certain information-sharing between state and federal authorities, one that requires the California state attorney general to “inspect” any facilities holding illegal immigrants, and one that bars private employers from cooperating with federal authorities. According to the Justice Department, “The Supremacy Clause does not allow California to obstruct the United States’ ability to enforce laws that Congress has enacted or to take actions entrusted to it by the Constitution.”
Legally, this is a complicated matter. The federal government can’t force state officials to administer or execute a federal law. That’s called “commandeering” and it’s outside federal power according to both the Tenth Amendment and the Supreme Court case of Printz v. United States, which struck down a federal law that tried to force local law enforcement to perform background checks on gun purchases.
The feds can provide financial incentives for state and local officials to cooperate, but they can’t make them do anything if they don’t want to. If the feds want to enforce federal law and state and local officials don’t want to help, the feds must do it themselves, and pay the financial and political costs that go with it. On the other hand, states can’t interfere with the enforcement of federal law, either.
To the extent that California is actively interfering with federal immigration enforcement, as opposed to merely passively refusing to cooperate, the federal government may well have a case here. But I wonder if Sessions’ rather strong rhetoric points to a potential federal response that goes beyond litigation. It wouldn’t be the first time a president has sent troops to enforce federal law when local officials stood in the way.
One famous example was President Eisenhower’s use of federal troops from the 101st Airborne to enforce the desegregation of Little Rock schools over the active opposition of Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus. Faubus called out the Arkansas National Guard; Eisenhower issued an order placing the Guard under federal control, and then sent in approximately 1,000 federal troops.
Eisenhower’s authority for this was the Insurrection Act, a federal statute that authorizes the president to use federal forces to execute the law. Normally, this is done at the request of a state’s governor. However, if the governor fails to make such a request, the president can still invoke the Insurrection Act.
Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco’s hesitance to make that request led to delays in the run-up to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. President George W. Bush’s reluctance to override Blanco, a female governor of a different party who had not consented to turning over authority to the federal government, was another cause of the delays. But President Trump is unlikely to be so circumspect.
The key section of the Insurrection Act provides: “Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any state by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings,” the president may call the state’s National Guard into federal service, and employ whatever federal armed forces he considers necessary.
So at what point does California’s response move from passive resistance (which is permitted) to “unlawful obstructions, combinations ... or rebellion against the authority of the United States?” I’m not sure, and I don’t think we’re there yet. But Sessions’ strong language suggests that he thinks we’re closer than we should be. Stay tuned. .",0
1461,"Millions of people fleeing wars, violence, corruption and poverty in their home countries went on the move this decade, driving politics and anti-immigration sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic. In the U.S., illegal immigration surged in the latter part of the decade, and there was a big change in who was trying to enter the country from the Southern border. As the Mexican economy improved and deportations soared during President Obama’s first term, the number of illegal immigrants from Mexico declined significantly, and in their place came families and children traveling alone, most from the Central American nations of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. By 2014, Mexican nationals for the first time in modern history made up a minority of border arrests. Nearly 140,000 people traveling as families and children traveling alone made up the new majority. Most asked for asylum, saying they were fleeing violence and corruption in their home countries. The Obama administration was initially unprepared for the flood, setting up the first of what would turn out to be multiple humanitarian crises at the border. It opened family jails in an effort to deter the asylum seekers, but the detention facilities were scaled back in the summer of 2015 after a federal judge in California ruled that the government could only detain parents with their children for up to 20 days. Until recently, the families and children seeking asylum were allowed to remain in the U.S. until their claims were decided. Hundreds of thousands are still waiting for that process to play out amid a backlog of more than one million cases pending in immigration court. In the federal fiscal year ended in September, 65% of those arrested crossing the Mexican border—about 550,000 people—were either traveling as families or were unaccompanied minors. That figure, on the rise since 2017, set off its own crisis as the Trump administration tried to deter migrants through tougher detention policies. While the White House reversed course on some of its tactics—including separating migrant children from their parents—it claimed they were effective overall. Its most effective policy appears to have been the one known as “Remain in Mexico,” in which tens of thousands of asylum seekers this year have been forced to wait in Mexico instead of the U.S. until their cases are resolved. The policy, which critics say violates the migrants’ due-process rights and puts them at risk in unsafe Mexican cities, has helped to significantly lower the number of families arrested crossing the border in recent months. In Europe, meanwhile, a steep surge in the number of asylum seekers reaching Europe in 2015 was one of the most momentous political developments on the continent since the eurozone debt crisis broke out five years earlier. The influx of nearly two million people, mostly from the Middle East, Africa and Afghanistan, bolstered anti-immigration parties from Greece to Sweden, Germany, Spain and Denmark. It also opened a deep rift between Eastern- and Western-European countries over how to spread the burden of caring for the newcomers. Thousands of people drowned in the Mediterranean Sea trying to migrate to Europe from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan. Photos of rickety rafts overloaded with migrants and the body of a Syrian boy on a beach drew global attention to the issue in 2015. By the end of 2016, the U.N. estimated that about 5.2 million refugees had fled to Europe. In the U.K., concern over migration was one of the key issues in the campaign leading to the 2016 referendum on leaving the European Union. In Germany, a country where politics is still shaped by memories of the Nazi era, the refugee crisis pushed support for the anti-immigration, nationalist AfD into double digits, allowing it to enter parliament for the first time in 2017. In 2019, the U.N. estimated that there are more than 20 million refugees world-wide and more than 41 million “internally displaced persons” who have fled their homes amid war or other political conflicts.",0
540,"President Trump’s proposed wall along the United States-Mexico border has soared in popularity with American voters across the board, as he battles a split GOP-Democrat Congress to secure funding for the barrier.
The latest OutletName/Washington Post poll reveals a major shift among nearly all demographic groups across the country when it comes to support for a border wall at the southern border.
This time last year, the poll claimed that only 34 percent of voters supported a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Today, support for the wall has climbed to 42 percent overall. Most notable, swing voters are increasingly supportive of the border wall to control immigration.
Last year, less than 30 percent of swing voters said they supported the wall. Today, their support has soared to 40 percent, an 11 percent increase in support year-to-year.
Some good news for Trump on the border wall in new OutletName/WaPo Poll:
Support for a border wall increased from 34% to 42%
Among college-educated, up 13pts
Among Independents, up 11pts
Among midwesterners, up 14pts
Among 18-39 yr. olds, up 5pts
Among nonwhites, up 6pts — Ryan James Girdusky () January 13, 2019
Likewise, now 67 to 87 percent of Republican voters and conservatives support building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrat voters have not increased their opposition to the wall over the last year by even one percent.
Among midwest voters, college educated voters, men, and white Americans, the border wall has jumped in popularity since last year. For midwest voters, the poll claimed only 35 percent supported the wall last year. Today, midwest support for the wall is up to nearly 50 percent, a 14 percent increase.
Only 30 percent of college educated voters supported the wall last year, the poll stated. This year, 43 percent support the wall, a jump of 13 percent. Similarly, a majority of 54 percent of white Americans now support the wall, up ten percent from last year, and nearly 50 percent of American men support the wall, an increase of nine percentage points.
Exclusive–Kris Kobach: A Wall Stops Illegal Immigration, ‘Drones and Sensors’ Don’t://t.co/3kGg2CsPDu — John Binder 👽 () January 8, 2019
Currently, the federal government has remained partially shut down as House Democrats block any funding for physical barriers at the U.S.-Mexico border. A handful of Senate Republicans, meanwhile, crafted a plan to give amnesty to illegal aliens that ultimately failed to gain traction.
President Donald Trump has said he is reviewing a plan to deem the border and illegal immigration a national emergency in order to fund a wall along the southern border.
Border crossings in November 2018 — the last month from which data is available — hit close to 52,000, marking the highest level of illegal immigration in the month of November since 2006. Projections indicate that illegal immigration for next year will reach 600,000 border crossings, the highest level of illegal immigration in more than a decade. Meanwhile, drug overdoses in 2017 killed an unprecedented 72,287 U.S. residents, nearly three times the number of individuals killed by global terrorism. Nearly 50,000 of those deadly overdoses were caused by either heroin or fentanyl.",1
2638,"The Trump administration said on Tuesday it is exploring ways to keep providing food assistance to America’s poor if a partial government shutdown continues much longer, and urged lawmakers to end the uncertainty with a budget deal stalled by President Donald Trump’s demand for funding for border wall with Mexico.The administration’s position places the so-called Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, (SNAP) which feeds roughly 40 million Americans, at the center of a budget standoff between Trump and the Democrat-controlled Congress that has cut off funding for much of the government since late December.
SNAP has received funding through February thanks to a legal provision that allowed money to be allocated within 30 days of a government shutdown, but the government has not identified a mechanism to extend the program into March.
“We continue to examine our options for SNAP benefits in March. The best solution is for Congress to pass appropriations legislation in a form the President can sign,” Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture (USDA) said in an emailed response.
He did not elaborate on the content of options that are being examined.
The partial government shutdown was triggered last month by Trump’s demand that lawmakers provide nearly $6 billion dollars for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border - which he had promised voters during his election campaign.
Democrats have refused to include that funding, arguing a wall is unnecessary, and that there are more sophisticated ways to shore up national security and limit illegal immigration.
There was little sign on Tuesday that Trump and Democrats were any closer to agreeing on a compromise to end the shutdown, now in its fifth week.
The shutdown has rippled through a broad swatch of federal government, impacting national parks, airline security screening and the release of economic data. About 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or are working without pay.
On Saturday, Trump proposed ending the government shutdown in a deal that would have restored temporary protections for immigrants brought illegally to the United States as minors, in exchange for the $5.7 billion he is seeking for the wall. Democrats promptly rejected Trump’s plan as insufficient.
Last year, SNAP was at the heart of months-long bitter partisan debate over farm bill, when Trump wanted to tighten requirements to be eligible for the food stamps, a move for which he failed to garner enough support.",0
839,"An aid group sympathetic to the migrant caravan currently parked in Tijuana says some members of the group are planning to scramble across the U.S. border en masse.
According to OutletName, Angels without Borders founder Sergio Tamai talked to San Diego’s Spanish-language media Telemundo 20 and said, “They have that intention. I believe that thousands could make that jump.”
There are about 3,000 migrants camping out in Tijuana with many more on the way. The locals have not exactly been welcoming, with the mayor and an angry mob calling the would-be Central American refugees “an invasion” and calling them “criminals” and “freeloaders.”
The Department Of Homeland Security is warning Americans that the migrants are not an innocuous collection of women and children. It is uncertain what happens next. A federal judge nixed President Donald Trump’s plans to order a temporary halt to illegal immigrants obtaining refugee status. If the migrants are allowed to apply for asylum, it could take six months to assess their claims.
But many of the migrants aren’t prepared to wait for due process and tell Telemundo that they are prepared to break-in to the United States.
“Most of us, yes — we want to be on the other side,” said Jorge Molina, from Honduras. “Some want to jump over the wall, others to go another way, and others want to wait and see what kind of response they get.” The migrant caravan has attracted controversy and notoriety from the beginning of its trek from Honduras. There have been numerous clashes with Mexican authorities.
A OutletName report detailed how some of the migrants are armed with guns and Molotov cocktails that could be still be used in any border confrontation. One migrant offhandedly told a reporter about his conviction for attempted murder, but said he was sure a pardon awaited him in the United States.",1
1339,"President Donald Trump proposed a path to citizenship for 1.8 million undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, if lawmakers agree to create a $25 billion fund to expand barriers along the Mexican border and implement other deep changes to the immigration system. The White House suggested the proposal moved Mr. Trump a step closer to the Democrats, who have championed the cause of the young immigrants known as Dreamers, but the plan includes demands they have fiercely opposed. The Trump plan also risks the ire of hard-liners who oppose any such pathway to citizenship. The White House proposal, presented to Senate leaders and congressional aides on Thursday, would restrict family-based immigration, the channel by which most immigrants have come to the U.S. for the past half-century. It also calls for an end to a lottery program that randomly awards 50,000 green cards annually to foreigners from countries underrepresented in U.S. immigration. Mr. Trump was in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum on Thursday. His top aides told Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that the president would sign into law legislation that included these changes. Mr. McConnell said he would bring a bill to a vote during the week of Feb. 5, White House officials said. It wasn’t clear whether Mr. McConnell could find sufficient support. To reach the 60 required votes for such measures to pass, he will need backing from most Republicans, who hold 51 seats, and some Democrats. Passage in the House was also in doubt, with opposition from Democrats expected over policy changes and border-wall funding, and opposition from conservatives over a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump’s multipart plan contrasts with calls from some on Capitol Hill, including Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) for a deal largely centered on just two issues: the fate of the Dreamers and border security. Mr. Trump’s proposal would offer a path to citizenship within 10 to 12 years for 1.8 million Dreamers—people whose parents brought them to the U.S. illegally as children. About 700,000 Dreamers were shielded from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program created by former President Barack Obama in 2013. In September, Mr. Trump ended the program, known as DACA, but gave Congress until its expiration on March 5 to replace it. The rest of the immigrants aren’t enrolled in DACA but could have qualified. “This represents a dramatic concession by the White House to get to 60 votes from the Senate,” a senior administration official said, describing the bill as a “compromise on many fronts.” But Mr. Trump’s broad-reaching proposal ran counter to the mood on Capitol Hill Thursday, where lawmakers have been trying to narrow the parameters of negotiations to boost their chances of being able to cut a deal. The White House framework was released shortly after senators scattered for the weekend and while the House is on a week-long recess. But earlier Thursday, both Democrats and Republicans had been advocating winnowing the scope of the immigration talks to focus primarily on border security and addressing the fate of the Dreamers. “As we found time and again, when we open up the negotiations to discussions of broad immigration reform, there is no end to what each party says could be on the table,” Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday. “We should find a narrow deal on DACA and border security.” Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) said the best strategy would be to bring to the Senate floor a slimmer bill that dealt only with border security and giving the Dreamers legal status for now, with the chance to expand it if enough senators agreed on other issues. Some Republicans support allowing Dreamers to become citizens, but others are worried about whether that would enable them to sponsor their parents and other relatives for green cards. Many experts, including some in the Trump administration, say that if Dreamers are going to be allowed to stay in the U.S., they should have a path to citizenship so they don’t have perpetual second-class status. Some conservatives argue it isn’t fair to grant citizenship to people who came to the U.S. illegally and it would encourage others to break the law. “No one should be awarded citizenship for knowingly breaking our law,” said Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R., Tenn.), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, saying most Dreamers were teenagers when they entered the U.S. and knew what they were doing. “It’s an insult to all those who have followed the rules.” When the president said he would be in favor of a pathway to citizenship late Wednesday before leaving for Davos, the conservative website OutletName.com ran a headline referring to Mr. Trump as “Amnesty Don.” But Mr. Trump has long said he was open to protecting Dreamers, and the White House is betting that his supporters will overlook those concessions if he can secure funding for a border wall. Mr. Trump’s path to citizenship would also include requirements for work, education and “good moral character,” which has long been one of the requirements for naturalization in the U.S. That status could be revoked in the case of criminal conduct, public safety concerns or dependency on the government for subsistence, such as cash assistance. While Mr. Trump promised voters he would make Mexico pay for the wall, his plan instead asks Congress to find $25 billion for a trust fund that future lawmakers couldn’t divert to other programs. The goal is to ensure long-term funding for the plan, but doing so will require lawmakers to sign off on a huge expansion of the existing border barrier. Today, 654 miles of the 2,000 mile border have some sort of fencing. Under the Trump plan, the total would top 900 miles, with hundreds of miles of existing fencing replaced and in some cases built higher. The total price tag on Mr. Trump’s plan for border security—along both the southern and northern border—would cost billions more, White House officials said. Asked if it would cost another $5 billion, one White house official said that amount was “in the ballpark.” The administration is also seeking policy changes that would limit the rights of children arriving at the border alone, as well as quicker removal of people already in the U.S. illegally. It also wants more border agents and immigration judges. On family-based immigration, Mr. Trump’s plan would restrict what conservatives call chain migration to only spouses and minor children.That would shut out adult children, siblings and parents. The administration argues that successive rounds of family-based admissions tilts the immigrant pool away from young, skilled workers best equipped to prosper and assimilate. Those who have already applied for family-based immigration would be allowed to continue through the process, under Mr. Trump’s plan. Some of that backlog would be cleared by using slots from the Diversity Visa Lottery. The president called for an end to the process, a marginal visa program once tied to efforts to help Irish migrants, after it was used by the man accused of driving a rented truck through a crowd of cyclists and pedestrian in New York City. Ending the program would also free up visas to be used for skilled migrants, a White House official said.",0
2205,"It’s not just sanctuary cities: There are also sanctuary campuses.
President Donald Trump has been moving fast on immigration reform in the United States, announcing a crackdown on illegal immigration. Undocumented college students, including those registered under President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, are concerned for their future and continued education.
Universities have responded to these concerns after the election in a variety of forms, even while the “sanctuary campus” legalities remain unclear.
Here’s a look at how schools around the country are participating in the sanctuary campus movement.

8,"Images and videos posted on social media Sunday afternoon showed hundreds of migrants from the leading Central American caravan pushing past Mexican riot police and rushing the border at the port of entry in San Ysidro, Calif., in a major test for both U.S. border authorities and Mexican officials. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it suspended northbound and southbound crossings for both pedestrians and vehicles at the San Ysidro port of entry at approximately 11:30 a.m. local time. It later tweeted that the pedestrian crossings had re-opened, a little more than four hours after the initial closure. The vehicle lanes re-opened at approximately 5 p.m. local time, five-and-a-half hours after they were closed. CBP added that some demonstrators ""attempted to illegally enter the U.S. through both the northbound and southbound vehicle lanes at the port of entry itself. Those persons were stopped and turned back to Mexico."" 
U.S. border agents shot several rounds of tear gas after some migrants attempted to penetrate various points along the border and threw what appeared to be rocks at U.S. authorities. Mexico's Milenio TV showed images of migrants climbing over fences and peeling back metal sheeting to enter. Tear gas fumes were carried by the wind toward people who were hundreds of feet away, including some children. Honduran Ana Zuniga, 23, also said she saw migrants opening a small hole in concertina wire at a gap on the Mexican side of a levee, at which point U.S. agents fired tear gas at them. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement that some migrants ""attempted to breach legacy fence infrastructure along the border and sought to harm CBP personnel by throwing projectiles at them. ""As I have continually stated, DHS will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons,"" Nielsen said. ""We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our frontline operators, or violates our nation’s sovereignty."" The Mexican Interior Ministry said Sunday afternoon it would immediately deport the migrants who tried to ""violently"" breach the border. The Mexican government described Sunday's events as ""acts of provocation"" that were ""far from helpful"" for the migrants' objectives. Earlier this month, President Trump said that troops stationed at the border would treat thrown rocks like ""firearms."" ""We're not going to put up with that,"" the president said. ""They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them to consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks, like they did at the Mexico military and police, I said, consider it a rifle."" The situation Sunday was not unprecedented. In 2013, during the Obama administration, Border Patrol agents used pepper spray to fend off a crowd of approximately 100 migrants who attempted to rush the San Ysidro port of entry. The migrants in that episode also reportedly threw rocks and bottles at U.S. authorities. Within an hour on Sunday, the group from the caravan that rushed toward the border largely dispersed. Most of the migrants in the group were men. OutletName had confirmed early Sunday through an organizer for Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the group helping organize the leading Central American migrant caravan, that members of the caravan were planning to attempt to cross the port of entry at San Ysidro later in the day. Footage posted by ITV correspondent Emma Murphy also showed several U.S. Border Patrol helicopters reportedly flying low overhead on the Mexican side of the border. In anticipation of the planned migrant effort, U.S. authorities said they had deployed additional personnel to the San Ysidro port of entry on Sunday, including Air and Marine agents. Other video showed migrants pushing toward a border fence chanting, ""Yes we can."" The dramatic escalation at the border came as Mexico's incoming government denied reports Saturday that it had struck a deal with the White House to keep asylum-seekers in the country while their claims move through U.S. immigration courts. President Trump, for his part, again threatened to close the entire southern border if no deal could be reached between the two counties. On Saturday, the first episode of caravan-related violence directed at U.S. authorities was reported by U.S. Border Patrol in Arizona, as a 31-year-old Honduran man who apparently split off from the caravan threw rocks at agents and a helicopter after setting a tree on fire. The prospective deal between the U.S. and Mexico was seen as a way to dissuade thousands of Central American migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S., a process that can take years. The legal bar for claiming asylum is high and generally requires applicants to show a specific risk of persecution based on factors such as race, nationality, politics or religion. Trump administration officials have characterized the vast majority of asylum claims as fraudulent or legally insufficient, and have taken steps to reduce the backlog of asylum claims that they say are often used by migrants to gain entry into the U.S. and disappear into the country as their claims are adjudicated. ""There is no agreement of any sort between the incoming Mexican government and the U.S. government,"" future Interior Minister Olga Sanchez said in a statement. Hours earlier, The Washington Post quoted her as saying that the incoming administration of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had agreed to allow migrants to stay in Mexico as a ""short-term solution"" while the U.S. considered their applications for asylum. Lopez Obrador will take office on Dec. 1. The newspaper also quoted Sanchez as saying: ""For now, we have agreed to this policy of Remain in Mexico.""  Sanchez did not explain in the statement why The Washington Post had quoted her as saying there had been an agreement. Early Sunday, Trump wrote on Twitter that it would be ""very SMART"" for Mexico to ""stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border"" to avoid future logistics challenges at the border.
There were signs last week that the Mexican government has received that message. Mexican immigration agents on Wednesday detained almost all of the Central American migrants on a fourth caravan that recently entered Mexico seeking to reach the U.S., with Mexico's National Immigration Institute saying 213 migrants were detained and taken to a processing center. Those found to lack proper documents may face repatriation to their home countries. Other administration officials sounded notes of optimism despite the apparent confusion on how to handle the migrants. ""President Trump has developed a strong relationship with the incoming [Lopez] Obrador administration, and we look forward to working with them on a wide range of issues,"" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said over the weekend. Approximately 5,000 Central American migrants have arrived in recent days to Tijuana, just south of California, after making their way through Mexico via caravan. But agents at the San Diego port of entry process fewer than 100 claims per day. On Friday, the mayor of Tijuana declared a humanitarian crisis in his border city of 1.6 million people,  saying he was asking the United Nations for aid to deal with the approximately 5,000 Central American migrants, most of whom were camped out inside a sports complex. The comments by Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum came as city officials and volunteers worked together to assist the 4,976 men, women and children who had arrived after more than a month on the road. Tijuana declares humanitarian crisis amid caravan arrivalVideo
Hundreds of Tijuana residents have protested their arrival, complaining that recent caravans forced their way into Mexico from Guatemala. Trump threatened Thursday, and again on Saturday, to shut down the border crossing entirely if his administration determines that Mexico has lost ""control"" of the situation in Tijuana. Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin, described the Remain in Mexico plan as a strategy to take away the ability of migrants to live and work in the U.S. while cases are processed. ""The hope is that asylum seekers will not want to live in [Mexico] for months/years and won't come,"" Leutert wrote on Twitter. She added: ""The big question is why would Mexico agree to this? ... Mexico has its own migratory enforcement interests and the various caravans have been a huge headache."" U.S. officials have said for months that they were working with Mexico on possible proposals. One variation, called ""Safe Third,"" would have denied asylum claims on the grounds that asylum seekers had found haven in Mexico. President Enrique Pena Nieto offered thousands of Central Americans asylum on Oct. 26 if they agreed to remain in southern Mexico. Close to 3,000 migrants took Mexico up on the offer. Sanchez said Saturday that the next government does not plan for Mexico to become a ""Safe Third"" country. Julieta Vences, a congresswoman with Lopez Obrador's Morena party who is also president of Mexico's congressional migrant affairs commission, told the AP that incoming Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard has been discussing with U.S. officials how to handle a deluge of asylum claims at the border. ""They're going to have to open the borders (for the migrants) to put in the request,"" Vences said. ""They will also give us dates, on what terms they will receive the (asylum) requests and in the case that they are not beneficiaries of this status, they will have to return here,"" Vences said. She said Mexico needs to examine how to accommodate the migrants without angering locals. ""When they come back, we need to see how ... we can integrate them into an economic activity so that they can develop and not generate conflict with our own communities."" Local churches and charities have been feeding the migrants, with assistance from state and federal agencies. They also have distributed thousands of blankets, thin mattresses and personal hygiene kits.",1
2558,"U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to support legislation that would open a path to citizenship for as many as 1.8 million “Dreamers,” young immigrants brought illegally to the country as children, senior White House officials said on Thursday.
The White House offered to more than double the number of people protected from deportation, describing it as a major concession aimed at attracting enough votes for an immigration deal from Democrats.
But the plan comes with significant strings attached to appeal to Republicans, including requirements to slash family sponsorship of immigrants, tighten border security and provide billions of dollars in funding for a border wall with Mexico that Trump made one of his major campaign promises.
The package was immediately panned by pro-immigration groups, which said the plan was a bad trade-off. It was also slammed by some conservative groups, which decried the expansion of “amnesty” for illegal immigrants.
The head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Democratic Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, said the Trump plan used Dreamers as “bargaining chips for sweeping anti-immigrant policies.”
Early reaction from Republicans in the Senate - where the plan may receive a vote in early February - was positive. Conservative Republican Senator Tom Cotton called the plan “generous and humane, while also being responsible.” Republicans narrowly control the chamber by 51-49 and need Democratic votes to pass legislation.
The fight over protections for Dreamers, which are set to expire in March, was part of the standoff between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that resulted in a three-day government shutdown that ended on Monday.
They agreed to extend funding until Feb. 8, leaving a small window to come to a deal on immigration. Trump’s plan will help provide guidance for those talks, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement.
Negotiations will be tough. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, who has championed the cause of the Dreamers, said the plan put Trump’s “entire hardline immigration agenda - including massive cuts to legal immigration - on the backs of these young people.”
Trump, whose tough immigration stance was a key part of his 2016 presidential campaign, said in September he was ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program for Dreamers that was created by Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.
The DACA protections apply to about 700,000 people, but White House officials said there were at least that many illegal immigrants who qualified for the program but did not sign up for it.
Officials said the 1.8 million people could apply to become citizens in 10 to 12 years providing they had jobs and did not commit crimes.
Trump’s plan would require Congress to set up a $25 billion “trust fund” to build a wall on the southern border with Mexico, and invest in better protections at the northern border with Canada.Congress would have to allocate additional money to border guards and immigration judges, a figure that the Republican president pegged at $5 billion on Wednesday, but which White House officials said was up for further discussion.
The White House also wants Congress to change rules to allow for the rapid deportation of illegal immigrants from countries other than Mexico and Canada who arrive at the U.S. border, the officials said.
White House officials made clear that a deal could not only address DACA and the border wall but must also end a visa lottery program for certain countries and limit family sponsorship of immigrants to spouses and minor children - ending sponsorship for parents, older children and siblings.
Stephen Legomsky, who was chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration, called the plan a “horrendous tradeoff” and predicted Democrats would reject it.
“It offers a one-time citizenship path to innocent Dreamers and expects in return a massive permanent cut to family immigration, the permanent elimination of the entire diversity program, and a huge expenditure for a border wall,” said Legomsky, now at Washington University Law School in St. Louis.
A group of immigrant youth called United We Dream said the deal was “pitting us against our own parents, Black immigrants and our communities.”
Groups that oppose allowing illegal immigrants to remain in the United States also voiced criticism, and urged Congress to take its time.
“While it includes a number of tough immigration enforcement provisions, it includes an amnesty that is more than twice the size of the DACA population,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors restrictions.
To become law, the measures would also need to pass the House of Representatives, where Republicans have a bigger majority. A senior White House official declined to speculate on whether the plan would pass the chamber.
“I think the House will have an independent vehicle,” the second official said. “We’re not trying to force something on the House.”
Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican Cuban-American from Miami and longtime advocate of immigration reform, praised Trump for putting forward a “serious proposal.”
Democratic Representative Luis Gutiérrez said, however, that the plan ”doesn’t pass the laugh test.
“It would be far cheaper to erect a 50-foot concrete statue of a middle finger and point it towards Latin America, because both a wall and the statue would be equally offensive and equally ineffective,” the Illinois lawmaker said on Twitter.",0
600,"President Donald Trump will offer another compromise deal on Saturday to end the shutdown over the border wall, and Democrats will approve $1.1 billion to buy extra surveillance technology and additional immigration judges, according to Friday evening media reports.
OutletName reported:
A senior administration official told OutletName News Chief Washington Correspondent Major Garrett that Mr. Trump will present what the White House believes could be a deal to end the shutdown. The deal was largely influenced by talks between Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.
Kushner and Pence met with McConnell in the Senate Majority Leader’s office on Thursday evening.
The proposal will be made via a 3:00 p.m. presidential announcement from the White House.
OutletName reported that the Democratic proposal would not add any money for the border fence, despite Trump’s repeated push for $5.7 billion or his compromise offer of $2.5 billion. Trump’s request for $5.7 billion in 2019 would buy an extra 234 miles of border fence on the 2,000-mile border.
WASHINGTON — House Democrats have added more than $1 billion in border-related spending to a package of funding bills that would reopen most of the government … … About half the money, $524 million, would be for additional infrastructure at ports of entry on the border, one Democrat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the plans have not been formally announced, while $563 million more would be inserted to fund 75 immigration judges, who adjudicate the claims of migrants who make asylum claims at the border.
Trump posted two Tweets on Friday night, including a hinted description of the proposed compromise:
I will be making a major announcement concerning the Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border, and the Shutdown, tomorrow afternoon at 3 P.M., live from the . — Donald J. Trump () January 18, 2019
Trump said:
Everything we are asking for, whether it is the wall or barrier, whether it is the technology, whether it is the drug-detecting equipment, this is what law enforcement wants, this is what they need. Wait until you see the results. They’ll be proud of it and we’ll be even prouder.
On January 9, Kushner and Pence met with a group of business-first GOP Senators, led by Sen. Lindsey Graham. The GOP Senators urged the White House to swap an amnesty for perhaps three million “DACA” illegals in exchange for a few billion dollars for the border wall.
Media reports on the proposal did not say the Senators backed Trump’s call for vital reforms to block the migration of poor Central Americans into the United States via the multiple catch-and-release rules in border law.
Since January 9, Graham has repeatedly urged Trump to give up his wage-boosting “Hire American” policy to get wall funding.
Lindsey 'Gang of Eight' Graham says he will support border-wall emergency if Trump spends 3 weeks offering DACA amnesty & TPS giveaway to Dems & business. IOW, wants Trump to trade his 'Hire American' policy to get a symbolic wall w/o vital asylum reforms ://t.co/in1VRRrc2f — Neil Munro () January 14, 2019
The January 10 reports did say the Senators also want to include an expansion of the H-2B visa program which allows U.S. landscapers, restaurants, fish processors,and forestry companies to import cheap workers and so reduce wages for their American employees.
In the zig-zag talks, Trump has already given several concessions to the Democrats, who have not offered anything in exchange.
OutletName‘ report about an extra $1.1 billion in border security spending is a minor concession. The public — and nearly all legislators — strongly support the deployment of drug-detection technology.
Democrats pocket Trump's several concesssions in the border wall/shutdown talks, and continue to describe the wage-cutting economic migrants as refugees who deserve humanitarian aid. Q: Can the Dem. leaders enforce a compromise in the 'diversity party'? ://t.co/cf9Qnr0tzf — Neil Munro () January 10, 2019
Democrats hate Trump’s border wall because they see it as a symbolic public rejection of their plans to impose greater diversity on Americans. The wall is “an immorality,” according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It “is not who we are as a nation,” she said January 3.
Via Twitter, pro-migrant activists shared their worries about the nature of Trump’s offers, which follow several prior concessions by Trump, including a decision to build a fence of steel slats instead of the proposed concrete wall, which is loathed by pro-migration Democrats.

1274,"After tens of thousands of families streamed across America’s southern border late last year, a Catholic charity in Tucson, Ariz., opened a monastery to house asylum-seeking migrants whom federal agents released. The 66,000-square-foot space is now full. The recent discovery of an unused closet caused excitement. An additional 113,797 people in families had crossed this year by the end of March, and border agents in El Paso, Texas, housed some under a bridge. Last month, Yuma, Ariz., declared an emergency after a converted strip-mall thrift store serving as a shelter hit capacity. Last week, a giant white tent opened on the outskirts of Donna, near the Rio Grande—the government’s latest desperate attempt to house the families. In April, a single-month record of 58,000 parents and children crossing together illegally were arrested, federal data released Wednesday show. A deepening humanitarian crisis on the border is straining towns, aid groups and federal agencies as thousands of families, when released, immediately need shelter. Instead of the single job seekers of a decade ago who aimed to sneak in undetected, these are families openly seeking asylum—more like the groups of refugees familiar on borders elsewhere in the world, where wars, famine and genocide have created massive camps of displaced families with nowhere to go. Families arrive at a U.S. border unprepared to absorb the sheer numbers of adults and children who are, by law, allowed to remain at least temporarily—confounding federal policy and the Trump administration. It is getting more chaotic, as Border Patrol officials shuttle immigrants hundreds of miles to find space. According to the new federal data, 248,000 parents and children had illegally entered the U.S. by April since the federal fiscal year began in October, more than in any prior full year. The families are mostly citizens of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras citing gang violence, hunger, poverty and corruption. Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers have argued that legal loopholes encourage asylum seekers, but those loopholes have existed for years. “President Trump has repeatedly exposed the loopholes littered throughout our immigration laws and offered many solutions to address them,” said a White House spokesman. The administration has tried multiple responses: separating adults from their children, pushing Congress to change immigration law, threatening to close the border before backing down, sending troops to the border. On April 29, President Trump ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department to start drafting regulations to speed up adjudications for asylum cases, charge migrants an application fee for asylum and deny them work permits while awaiting a decision. “The migration flow and the resulting humanitarian crisis is rapidly overwhelming the ability of the federal government to respond,” White House acting Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought told Congress last Wednesday in a request for $4.5 billion in emergency funding. The administration’s moves so far have neither stopped families from arriving nor found a solution to the overcrowding and turmoil at the border. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that the Trump administration for now can resume its practice of sending some Central American asylum-seekers to Mexico to wait for U.S. judge to rule in their asylum case—an unexpected victory for the administration. But that policy, which had been in effect for months before legal challenges interrupted it, has had little effect on the current crisis because of restrictions on who the government can remove. Gregorio, 27, and his 1-year-old daughter, Mirian, left Honduras for the U.S. in late March seeking safety and economic opportunity. They crossed Guatemala largely on foot and Mexico by bus, said Gregorio, whose backpack contains all they left home with, including a blanket for Mirian. They crossed with other Central Americans into the U.S. illegally near Calexico, Calif., a desert border town surrounded by farm and ranch lands about an hour west of the Arizona state line. Gregorio and his group immediately sought out Border Patrol agents, surrendered and started the process of requesting asylum. While authorities can in a number of hours deport single Mexican adults entering illegally for work, the U.S. lets most families requesting asylum stay while their cases are adjudicated. Medical personnel checked out the father and daughter. Immigration officials interviewed Gregorio, who told them he feared his life would be at risk if he went home. Officials approved them for the first step toward asylum. Over the next five days authorities moved him and Mirian to multiple crowded, spartan Border Patrol facilities in California and Arizona, Gregorio said. Typically, such locations include cinder-block holding cells with a sink and toilet—no bed—or holding areas with tents. The facilities were made to hold single men for hours, not families for days. “A lot of our stations were not built for this,” said Matthew Roggow, the Border Patrol’s acting deputy chief of the law enforcement operations directorate. “They weren’t built for this demographic.” Then it was time for Gregorio and Mirian to be let go—and start waiting. Asylum seekers like them spend months, sometimes years, waiting to have their cases heard in an immigration-court system backlogged with more than 869,000 cases. The trouble now: Where do they go meanwhile? Small border cities can’t always handle the daily release of hundreds of migrant families. For Gregorio and Mirian, that meant traveling almost 300 miles to ride to Tucson, where a van later dropped them and 35 others off at the monastery-turned-shelter last month. Other Border Patrol officials last month shuttled migrants to Tucson from the border in El Paso. Last year, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials started releasing migrants at parks and bus stations in San Diego and El Paso. Migrant-aid groups moved most of the newly freed migrants to shelters. As Gregorio and Mirian shuffled into the monastery at the edge of a middle-class neighborhood and barely 2 miles from the sprawling University of Arizona campus, run by Catholic Community Services of Southern Arizona, a 5-year-old Guatemalan boy riding a donated tricycle greeted them: “Bienvenidos!” During an orientation with volunteers, the families were treated to orange and grapefruit slices, Gatorade and water. As they waited for medical screenings and a room assignment, their first questions were where they headed next. “How far is San Antonio?” one man asked. “New Jersey?” another asked. Gregorio would spend a day or two in the shelter before taking a bus to Woodbridge, Va., where he had relatives. He carried a slip of paper with a date to appear in a nearby immigration office, where he would begin the process of asking a judge to let them stay permanently. Immigration researchers and federal officials say they aren’t certain why so many families are coming. Widespread hunger, gang violence, and government corruption have been factors. The spread of the internet and social media has disseminated information—and testimonials—about how to seek asylum that previous generations didn’t have. The numbers aren’t unprecedented. In 2006, border agents arrested more than 1 million illegal immigrants, compared with 460,000 in the first seven months of this fiscal year. That earlier number was driven by single adults, mostly from Mexico. What’s unprecedented is the numbers seeking asylum. One previous flood of asylum seekers came during the 1980 Mariel boatlift, when an estimated 125,000 Cubans arrived on U.S. shores, often in rickety boats, over about six months. They overwhelmed authorities and facilities in South Florida and forced the government to move newly arriving Cubans to temporary holding facilities at military bases around the U.S. and Puerto Rico. It became a political problem for President Carter, whose administration had been granting refugee status to any Cuban who arrived in the U.S. The Obama administration was inundated with tens of thousand of unaccompanied migrant children and families in 2014. Children coming alone reached a high of more than 68,000 that year. While some families were sent home, most took their place in line in the massive immigration-court backlog. The administration called in the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help manage some operations, and opened jails specifically to accommodate entire families. A judge later ruled that children with parents couldn’t be held longer than 20 days. Obama administration officials also launched a public-relations campaign in Central America, warning migrants not to make the trip. The Trump administration hasn’t brought in FEMA but has temporarily moved hundreds of Customs and Border Protection officers to the busiest border sectors to help process migrants. It has added more-rigorous medical screenings for young migrants in the wake of the deaths of two Guatemalan children in government custody in December. ‘Breaking point’
Kevin McAleenan, the former head of Customs and Border Protection and now interim DHS head, said in March that “a breaking point has arrived” because the system he oversees can’t cope with the numbers. The Trump administration has met resistance to the approaches it has cycled through. It tried “zero tolerance,” prosecuting adults for illegal entry and separating them from their children but halted the practice amid an outcry. Mr. Trump backed down from his threat to close the border after U.S.-industry opposition. The administration’s pressure on Congress to change immigration law includes raising the standards for determining a person has a credible fear of returning home and overhauling rules about how long children can be jailed without parents. Congress hasn’t passed immigration reform this century and it is particularly unlikely with Democrats, who control the House, opposed to imposing more punitive policies. Democrats also appear skeptical about the administration’s request for $4.5 billion in emergency border spending. Mr. McAleenan, the DHS interim head, has said that without legal changes and more resources at the border, more children are likely to die in government custody. The most recent was a 16-year-old Guatemalan boy who died at a Texas hospital after becoming ill at a Department of Health and Human Services child migrant shelter. A speedup in asylum-claims processing won’t change the fact that migrant families need a place to stay in the first few days after crossing the border. The new facility in Donna, along with a similar one opened in El Paso, is meant to help. The complex, on a plot surrounded by wildflowers, features a large tent that will temporarily house migrants on mats on the floor. The facility has showers, portable bathrooms and laundry facilities. Officials admit the facilities, each intended to briefly house 500 members of families and unaccompanied children, won’t make a dent in the crisis. The Border Patrol’s Mr. Roggow said they would help alleviate crowding in patrol stations. A Homeland Security Advisory Council in a report last month recommended construction of more permanent regional processing centers. Without legal changes, they are “nothing but a welcoming center and will have no impact on stemming the flow of these family units coming across the border in these remote locations,” said Karen Tandy, chairwoman of the Homeland Security Advisory Council panel that produced the report, who headed the Drug Enforcement Administration under President George W. Bush. Migrant families, eager to avoid weekslong or monthslong lines at legal ports of entry such as Tijuana, head to remote border towns like El Paso, Yuma, Ariz., and Antelope Wells, N.M., where they can easily cross and flag down border agents. When Yuma Mayor Douglas Nicholls declared a state of emergency, he said it was to prompt the federal government to deal with the crisis. The city’s only shelter, a converted Salvation Army thrift store in a strip mall, had hit its capacity of 200, said Mr. Nicholls, a Republican. “We’re getting more people into the shelter than we’re able to move through in a day.” Salvation Army Captain Jeffrey Breazeale said shelter operations were started two days after a request from the city. In March, an El Paso processing center was so full agents created a temporary holding cell outside under a bridge. Photos of families huddled there spread online and prompted a national outcry. A week later, Border Patrol vans dropped migrant families at an El Paso motel advertising rooms for $34.05 a night. Volunteers from the aid group Annunciation House, which rented rooms at the Mesa Inn for migrants, greeted mothers holding belongings in plastic bags with hugs at a room near the courtyard pool, where families arriving earlier milled about and played Jenga. Annunciation House has opened a shelter in a warehouse and plans to house at least 500 people at a time there. Teresa Cavendish, who helps run the Tucson-monastery shelter, said there are Red Cross cots in nearly every available space, including part of the sanctuary. She never imagined it would fill up. “This place seemed enormous,” she said, “like there was no way we could possibly utilize it.”",0
123,"Days after Donald Trump won the White House vowing to deport millions of people in the country illegally and fortify the Mexican border, California farmer Kevin Herman ordered nearly $600,000 in new equipment, cutting the number of workers he'll need starting with the next harvest.
Herman, who grows figs, persimmons and almonds in the nation's most productive farming state, said Trump's comments pushed him to make the purchase, larger than he would have otherwise.
""No doubt about it,"" Herman said. ""I probably wouldn't have spent as much or bought as much machinery as I did.""
Others in California's farming industry say Trump's tough campaign talk targeting immigrants in the country illegally — including a vast number of farmworkers — spurred them into action, too.
EX-AG HOLDER HIRED TO HELP CALIFORNIA FIGHT TRUMP
They're calling on congressional representatives to educate the incoming president on the workforce it takes to feed the country, and they're assuring workers they'll protect them.
San Joaquin Valley farmer Joe Del Bosque recently gathered about 20 year-round employees at a Los Banos steakhouse for their annual holiday lunch.
The festivities began in a serious tone. The topic of immigration took a bigger part of the conversation this year because of Trump, he said.
Del Bosque told his crew he'll make sure the new administration knows their vital role in the farming industry. It's a message Del Bosque wants his managers to spread to another 300 seasonal workers needed at the harvest's peak.
Leticia Alfaro, a food-safety supervisor at the farm, said in an interview that many of her friends who work in the fields don't have proper documentation like her, and they take Trump's threats seriously.
""They're terrified by his comments,"" Alfaro, 53, said in Spanish.
They fear being deported and torn from their children who were born here, she said. After Trump takes office, they wonder if it will be safe to make a simple trip to the grocery store, fearing checkpoints where they'll be pulled over and have to show their documentation.
Trump's remarks were felt sharply in California, which produces nearly half the country's fruits, vegetables and nuts valued at $47 billion annually. Experts say his words resonate nationwide.
Texas, Florida and Georgia are examples of states with large migrant communities dominating home construction, health care, food service industries, said David Zonderman, a labor historian at North Carolina State University.
CALIFORNIA SNOWPACK MEASURES LOW, BUT BIG STORMS COMING
""California might be ground zero,"" he said of immigrant families living in the shadows. ""But it's not a unique California issue.""
The fear stems from Trump's campaign rallies, where he received a rousing response each time he vowed to deport people who are in the country illegally — up to 11 million. That position softened after Trump won the election, when he said he'd start with 3 million with criminal records.
Some farmers point to Trump's postelection shift as a sign his campaign bluster won't become reality. He is, after all, a businessman like them, they say. But others believe this shift underscores the president-elect's unpredictable nature.
""Our workers are scared,"" said Joe Garcia, a farm labor contractor who hires up to 4,000 people each year to pick grapes from Napa to Bakersfield and along the Central Coast. ""If they're concerned, we're concerned.""
Since Election Day, Garcia's crews throughout the state have been asking what will happen to them when Trump takes office. Farmers also are calling to see if they'll need to pay more to attract people to prune the vines, he said.
Garcia tells farmers not to panic. They'll learn how many return from Mexico after the holidays. ""We'll plan around what we have,"" he tells them. ""That's all we can do.""
Roughly 325,000 workers in California do the back-breaking jobs that farmers say nobody else will do, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Manuel Cunha Jr., president of the Nisei Farmers League farming association, estimates 85 percent of California farmworkers live in the United States illegally.
BIG BUSINESS PRESSURING TRUMP TO ABANDON PLEDGES OF MASS DEPORTATION
Farmers for years have scrambled under a shrinking labor pool.
Mexico's improving economy has slowed the flow of migrant workers. The dangerous border, controlled by drug cartels and human traffickers, keeps away others.
Herman, the farmer who bought three new almond sweepers, said Trump influenced him on top of California's rising minimum wage and a new law giving farm laborers overtime rights that are equal to workers in other industries.
Plus, Herman said, he's heard too many workers question whether they'll return from their holiday trips to Mexico. ""It's stories like that that have motivated me to become efficient and upgrade my equipment,"" Herman said.
Tom Nassif, a Trump adviser and president of the powerful trade association Western Growers, said farmers shouldn't fear the president-elect. Trump isn't interested in deporting their workers, he said.
Nassif said he isn't privy to the details of Trump's immigration policy. He's recommended that Trump allow farmworkers to stay by putting immigrants in the country illegally who are otherwise law-abiding residents on a period of probation under conditions that they pay taxes, learn English and obey all laws.
""I think he's looking at people who have committed more serious crimes and start with them first — and rightly so,"" said Nassif, picked by Trump's campaign team to serve on an agriculture advisory committee. ""I think there's less reason to worry than most people believe there is.""",1
170,"As many as 200,000 Salvadoran immigrants living in the United States will no longer be allowed to stay after the Trump administration announced the end to their protected status.
The Central Americans had been permitted to stay following a devastating earthquake in 2001, under Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.
In the 17 years that have followed, every administration has extended their window to stay, including the Obama administration in September 2016.
But new Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen determined Monday that the ""substantial disruption of living conditions caused by the earthquake no longer exist,"" according to the Department of Homeland Security.
The move could force those who had been protected under TPS to leave the U.S. by September 2019 or face deportation.
DHS states that the Salvadoran immigrants have 18 months until the official termination, in an effort to give them time to arrange for departure and for El Salvador to ""prepare for the return and reintegration of its citizens.""
The decision also gives the Salvadorans time to apply for other legal avenues to continue living in the United States. Last year, DHS also announced that they had ended TPS for Haitian and Nicaraguan citizens living in the U.S.
Salvadorans have been, by far, the largest beneficiaries of the program, which provides humanitarian relief for foreigners whose countries are hit with natural disasters or other strife.
The new DHS decision produces a serious challenge for El Salvador, a country of 6.2 million people whose economy counts on money sent by wage earners in the U.S. Over the past decade, growing numbers of Salvadorans -- many coming as families or unaccompanied children -- have entered the United States illegally through Mexico, fleeing violence and poverty.
Nielsen, who faced a Monday deadline for a decision, determined that El Salvador has received significant international aid to recover from the earthquake and that homes, schools and hospitals there have been rebuilt. Homeland Security also said more than 39,000 Salvadorans have returned home from the U.S. in two years, demonstrating El Salvador's capacity to absorb people.

226,"Top defense officials toured sections of the U.S.-Mexico border Saturday to analyze if reinforcement efforts are needed to block drug smuggling and other illegal activity, as the Pentagon weighs diverting billions of dollars for President Trump's border wall.
TRUMP PLANS TO ALLOCATE $8B TO BORDER WALL: SOURCE
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, accompanied by the Joint Chiefs chairman, Gen. Joseph Dunford, was visiting a border site near El Paso, Texas, called Monument Site 3.
Shanahan and Dunford got an up-close look at U.S. Border Patrol vehicles used for surveillance. The Department of Homeland Security has requested Pentagon help in operating about 150 of the vehicle-mounted surveillance cameras, which can see as far as eight miles away.
Shanahan also tried his hand at firing a couple of Border Patrol weapons, including one that uses plastic bullets.
Later, the officials planned to fly over two border control sites farther west. These sites are on a list of high-priority projects DHS submitted to Shanahan on Friday to support its request for money to pay for construction of roads, replacement of vehicle barriers and dilapidated pedestrian fencing, and installation of lighting. The pedestrian fencing would include detection systems that could alert border patrol agents when someone is attempting to damage or break through the fencing. The money would come from the Pentagon's drug interdiction programs.
One such project proposed by DHS, dubbed ""El Paso Project 1,"" includes segments of border west of El Paso, in Luna and Dona Ana counties, New Mexico. This is among areas DHS cites as known drug smuggling corridors used by Mexican cartels. Shanahan and Dunford were to fly over this site in a V-22 Osprey aircraft to get an aerial view of the site and to see where DHS resources are inadequate.
These projects are separate from, but related to, those which Shanahan is expected to pay for by diverting money that Congress appropriated for military construction projects. This could total as much as $3.6 billion, although Shanahan has not yet determined that the diversion is justified. His visit Saturday was meant to help him decide whether to approve such spending.
DHS has yet to provide the details that Shanahan says he needs before making his decision on the repurposing of military construction funds. He has said he is likely to provide the full $3.6 billion the White House is expecting, plus $2.5 billion from the drug interdiction program. Trump authorized the use of these military funds when he declared a national emergency to build a wall.
Wall construction would be done under contracts managed by the Army Corps of Engineers, whose commander, Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, accompanied Shanahan on Saturday. The Corps has built 126 miles (203 kilometers) of border wall in the last two years — mostly replacement barriers, Semonite told reporters.
Democrats in Congress, meanwhile, are seeking to block Trump's emergency declaration to stop the diversion of Pentagon funds for his border wall. The House is to vote Tuesday on a resolution to block Trump.
There are about 2,900 active-duty troops and about 2,100 National Guard troops on the border in support of Customs and Border Protection. That combined total of 5,000 is expected to grow to 6,000 by March 1 as the Pentagon provides additional support.
The border mission for active-duty forces began on Oct. 30, 2018 and has since been extended to Sept. 30.

2234,"University of Pennsylvania faculty gathered late Monday evening to protest alumnus and President Donald Trump’s executive order temporarily banning individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.
Over the weekend, affected Penn students and employees had been advised to contact international student services, and to defer travel abroad if possible.
Penn President Amy Gutmann specifically spoke against the executive order, both at Monday night’s faculty protest and in an email to students.

She said:
“President Trump’s recent Executive Order is injurious to our work and inimical to our values. The damage already done to the lawful freedoms and opportunities of our students and colleagues, here and around the world, is undeniable and indefensible. This order will weaken the promise of educational opportunity, intellectual discovery, and global engagement that so distinguishes American universities.”
She also shared some of her personal story. “I am the daughter of a Jewish immigrant who fled Nazi Germany. My grandfather was an immigrant. My son-in-law is an immigrant. My family’s story is part of a proud and productive American story, as is all of yours,” she said.
Trump graduated from Wharton, Penn’s school of business, in 1968. He is the first Penn graduate to be elected president of the United States. His daughter Tiffany graduated from Penn in May 2016.
Graduation! Congrats to the class of 2016! 🎓🎉 #upenn A photo posted by Tiffany Ariana Trump () on May 15, 2016 at 7:58pm PDT
On Sunday, members of the Penn community joined other Philadelphians in protesting the proclamation, which restricts those from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia from traveling to the U.S., at Philadelphia International Airport.
It is unclear exactly how many Penn students or employees might be affected by this ban. The Penn class of 2020 profile reports that 37 students come from the Africa/Middle East region, though it is unclear if this number simply represents undergraduates students in the United States with visas from those countries, or also includes any student with dual citizenship from a country in the region.
A Penn International “View Book,” published to advertise the University to foreign students, notes students have studied at Penn from Iran and Syria, but does not list any of the other five countries included in the executive order as represented in the undergraduate student body.
One student posted on Facebook that he was now “banned” from the U.S., but did not respond to a request for further comment.
Loujeine Boutar, an international student from Tunisia, said she was shocked and hurt by the executive order. “I tried to be rational, and to remind myself that they should care about national security, but this is not at all a response to national security. It’s something else. It’s not something rational.”
Boutar said she is concerned that in the future, Tunisia might be added to the list of countries. “Some Tunisian people who are marginalized do get recruited by ISIS,” she said. “I fear that if anything happens in Tunisia, or by a Tunisian person, Tunisia will be added to the list.”
Penn’s College Republicans said did not have an opinion on this issue and were awaiting a future board meeting to make an official statement. The group posted this statement on Facebook:
It reads, in part, “Although we consider comprehensive vetting to be of the utmost importance, we are not fully convinced that this order will provide additional security to the American people.”
Mena Shanab, one of the Penn students who attended the protest at Philadelphia International Airport, wrote in an email following the protest that “Donald Trump’s obstruction of migratory flows from Muslim-majority countries and his ban on refugee admissions and the issuance of visas is an irresponsible and morally repugnant proposal.” She continued, “As a Muslim-American whose close friends and family are currently living in several of those seven countries, I am petrified and deeply despondent. I took this painful amalgam of fear and despair out to the protest today the PHL airport and felt marginally better. On the one hand, it is uplifting and reassuring to see thousands of people come out in solidarity but at the same time, there is a feeling of hopelessness that pervades everything.”
Chloe Snyder, another Penn student who attended the airport protest, had a positive experience there. “It was really great. People were very orderly and peaceful. I went because I’m a Jewish-American. Seeing this type of executive action taken has struck a chord. We say never forget,” she said. “We’ve seen this story before. It can’t happen in America.”",0

Agents assigned to the Hebbronville Station received a call from a rancher whose property is located west of the town of Hebbronville, Texas, on Texas Highway 359. The agents responded to the scene along with a Webb County Medical Examiner’s Office death investigator, according to information obtained from Laredo Sector Border Patrol officials. The Border Patrol agents and the death investigator examined the remains and searched the area for clues as to the migrant’s identity.

Human smugglers, often connected to Mexican cartels, use ranches to march migrants around the immigration checkpoint. When one of the migrants becomes injured, dehydrated, overheated, or otherwise cannot keep up, the smuggler leaves them behind where they frequently die. Laredo Sector agents found the remains of another deceased migrant earlier this week on a ranch near Rio Bravo, Texas, OutletName News reported on Sunday. In nearby Brooks County, agents and sheriff’s office deputies recently recovered the bodies of two more migrants during a five day period. Officials suspect one of the migrants to be a Honduran national because of currency found in his pants. The second body belonged to a 34-year-old woman from Mexico. Her sister identified her body after Border Patrol agents apprehended her elsewhere on the ranch located on the west side of Brooks County. The sister told Border Patrol agents she saw their “guide” give her sister two pills after she became too weak to keep up with the group. The woman passed out a short time later and the human smuggler forced the group to leave her behind to die. The death toll for migrants who illegally crossed the border from Mexico into Texas now stands at 211, according to the International Organization for Migrants’ Missing Migrant Project. At least 348 migrants died during or shortly after illegal border crossings all along the U.S.-Mexico Border.",1
2535,"Many Norwegians rejected on Friday a suggestion by U.S. President Donald Trump that they would be more welcome to move to the United States than immigrants from “shithole countries” such as Haiti or African nations.
The Nordic country, one of the richest in the world by GDP per capita, was last year named the happiest nation on the planet and is known for a cradle-to-grave welfare state funded in part by large reserves of oil and natural gas.
Trump mentioned Norway in derogatory comments about other countries of migration as U.S. senators briefed him on Thursday on a newly drafted bipartisan immigration bill, according to two sources who asked not to be identified.
One of the sources who was briefed on the conversation quoted him as saying: “Why do we want all these people from Africa here? They’re shithole countries ... We should have more people from Norway.”
In one of several Twitter posts on Friday, Trump defended his stance on a bipartisan Senate immigration deal, but denied using the vulgar language ascribed to him.
“The language used by me at the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) meeting was tough, but this was not the language used,” he said. He also later denied using derogatory language about Haitians.
“On behalf of Norway: Thanks, but no thanks,” tweeted Torbjoern Saetre, a politician representing Norway’s Conservative Party in a municipality near Oslo.
Others condemned the U.S. president’s comments as inappropriate or racist.
“We are not coming. Cheers from Norway,” one woman wrote.
While hundreds of thousands of Norwegians emigrated to the U.S. in the 19th century, just 502 out of a population of 5.3 million people moved there in 2016, down 59 from the previous year, according to Statistics Norway.
“Will there be more now?” the statistics agency asked in a tweet.
Government officials, seeking to deflect attention, turned down a chance to comment. “We respectfully decline the opportunity,” one government official said when contacted by OutletName.
The reference to Norway may have been prompted by Prime Minister Erna Solberg who visited the White House on Wednesday when the president praised Norway for running a trade deficit with the United States and for buying U.S. military equipment.
Christian Christensen, an American professor of journalism at Stockholm University in neighboring Sweden, tweeted:
“Of course people from #Norway would love to move to a country where people are far more likely to be shot, live in poverty, get no healthcare because they’re poor, get no paid parental leave or subsidized daycare and see fewer women in political power. #Shithole”
Before the “shithole” controversy, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt tweeted that, judging by Solberg’s visit, “keys to success with Trump is personal charm, a solid trade deficit with the U.S. and buying tons of U.S. military hardware.”
Solberg, whose office also declined to comment on Trump’s remarks, is expected to announce soon an expansion of her cabinet to include Norway’s Liberal Party, a centrist group that favors strong environmental policies and more immigration.
“The first point of order in the new government declaration: Norway will still not be a shithole country,” tweeted Kjetil Alstadheim, the political editor of financial daily Dagens Naeringsliv.",0
834,"During his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Donald Trump spoke on the issues of illegal immigration and why more security is needed on the country’s southern border.
“We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens,” Trump said as he gave his 2019 State of the Union address. “Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.”
The speech comes as Congress remains divided on how to move forward with border security.
Trump, who made the issue a major campaign platform in 2016, has demanded $5.7 billion in funding to build a 234-mile long wall, citing a need to control crime and illegal immigration. However, Democrats have vehemently opposed the idea, framing it as immoral and a waste of taxpayer dollars.
A select group of 17 Republicans and Democrats from both the Senate and House met last week for the first day of border negotiations. The group, formed after the federal government officially existed the shutdown, is tasked with reaching a long-term compromise. The federal government experienced the longest partial shutdown in U.S. history, with Democrats and Republicans still at odds over the administration’s proposal for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The government will enter a shutdown again if Congress is not able reach a compromise by Feb. 15.
“No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards,” Trump continued in his speech Tuesday night. “Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime and a depleted social safety net.”
“Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border,” the president continued.
Trump went on to cite the success of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, citing their arrests of criminal aliens over the past two years. He then touted his “smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier” proposal his administration sent to Congress. His proposal also includes more enforcement officials, humanitarian assistance, drug detection and eliminating loopholes that can protect child smugglers.
“Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe,” the president concluded in his case for the wall.",1
2287,"Xavier Becerra, California's top law enforcement official, struck an optimistic tone Tuesday night in his Spanish-language rebuttal to President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech, leaning heavily on his family’s immigration story as he urged U.S. Latinos to turn out to vote in 2020.
""Your vote in November changed the votes in Congress,” said Becerra, the former 12-term U.S. House member who is also the state's first Latino attorney general. “Now that you see your power, are you ready to open new doors? Doesn’t it seem to you that it’s now time that we and our government build schools, not walls?”
Becerra in his brief address gave Democrats credit for blocking Trump’s proposed border wall, which led last month to a 35-day partial government shutdown, the longest such closure in U.S. history. Becerra said the Trump administration has sowed confusion, hostility and disorder.
Becerra, 61, has quickly emerged as a top Trump administration adversary since being appointed in 2017. His office has filed at least 45 lawsuits against Trump policies related to immigration, energy policy and the controversial immigration-status question proposed for the 2020 U.S. Census.
President Donald J. Trump (C) delivers the State of the Union address, with Vice President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, at the Capitol in Washington, D.C, February 5, 2019. Trump’s State of the Union address came after a bitter showdown with congressional Democrats, who successfully blocked the president’s signature campaign proposal of erecting additional miles of a U.S.-Mexico border wall.
Trump eventually relented as the costs of the government shutdown cascaded, reopening the government for three weeks with no money for his proposed border wall. He has threatened another shutdown, however, if Congress does not provide funding ahead of his Feb. 15 deadline.
Trump on Tuesday again urged Congress to approve funding for the border wall, painting an ominous picture of the impact of illegal immigration. He warned that another migrant caravan is once again making the trek through Mexico to the U.S. border, calling it a “tremendous onslaught.”
He also claimed illegal immigration was disproportionately affecting working-class Americans who “are left to pay the price” while “wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind gates and walls and guards.”
Becerra, who spoke from his alma mater, C.K. McClatchy High School in Sacramento, said Democrats are willing to debate comprehensive immigration reform, but he vowed that Democrats would fight any effort by the president to issue an emergency declaration to fund his wall, as Trump has threatened.
“Not only is it immoral, it’s illegal,” Becerra said. “We are prepared to reject this foolish proposal.”
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tapped Becerra to give the Spanish-language response. The Democratic leaders also chose former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams to give the English-language response to Trump's national address.
In a statement, Schumer said Becerra ""embodies the promise of America,"" while Pelosi praised him as ""a towering champion of equal justice and a tireless fighter for every American’s right to quality, affordable health care.""
Becerra, who once was the highest-ranking Latino in Congress, left Congress to become the state’s attorney general after Kamala Harris was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2016. Becerra often touts his biography in explaining why he has made it his mission to defend the rights of immigrants. His mother is an immigrant from Guadalajara, Mexico, who married his father, a U.S. citizen, who often traveled between the U.S. and Mexico.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra discusses various issues during an interview with The Associated Press, in Sacramento, California, Oct. 10, 2018. Becerra, California’s top prosecutor, has been among the most aggressive of the Democratic state attorneys general who have fought President Donald Trump in court. “I am the son of working-class immigrants,” Becerra said Tuesday. “My parents started their lives here for the same reason many people come to this country.”
In Congress, Becerra served as chair of the House Democratic Caucus and was also the first Latino to serve on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. He also served one term in the California Assembly from 1990 to 1992.

387,"A sobbing Alyssa Milano shared a video with her 3.6 million Twitter followers in which she referred to the United States’ southern border as “arbitrary lines in the sand” and accused border patrol agents of “destroying children’s lives” by enforcing America’s immigration laws. “I just watched this video of a baby being reunited with her mom,” said Milano, as she sobbed in front of the camera. “What the fuck are we doing? We are destroying lives. We are destroying children’s lives because of fucking arbitrary lines in the sand.” “We can’t let this be the new normal. Besides what this country was founded on — this is not innately who we are as human beings,” continued the actress. “We’ve gotta take inventory of this, of what’s happening, and the humanitarian crisis at the border. We gotta do something. We can’t ignore what’s happening. We can’t allow it to continue.” “We must take inventory,” reiterated Milano during her snivelling rant. “We must do something, please. I’m going to post this video. I’m going to post it right now … please turn up the sound.” Milano — who last May called for a “sex strike” in an effort to boycott states that do not allow for women to terminate their pregnancies after their child’s heartbeat is detected — urged her followers to allow themselves “to feel” and “to have empathy” with regards to illegal immigration. “Please watch the whole video,” said the actress. “Please allow yourself to feel, to have empathy, and then I need you to get angry because this is being done in our names, with our taxpayer dollars. We can’t allow it to continue, please.” “Please,” begged Milano. “Please allow yourself to feel what’s happening.” ",1
843,"OutletName and Politico both issued dubious fact-checks on President Donald Trump’s Tuesday night State of the Union address.
Trump’s address had a theme of “choosing greatness,” and began with a call for unity. He went on to share the successes of his administration. He also implored Congress to act on immigration, prescription drug pricing, trade and infrastructure among other issues.
At one point while discussing illegal immigration, Trump said, “One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.”
Politico immigration reporter Ted Hesson fact-checked that claim and rated it “partially true.”
Here’s Hesson’s explanation for the rating: “A 2017 report by Doctors Without Borders found 31 percent of female migrants and 17 percent of male migrants said they had been sexually abused while traveling through Mexico.”
So, Politico ruled Trump claiming 33.3 percent of women who make the trek from Central America to the U.S. get sexual assaulted on the way is only “partially true,” because the percentage he shared was off by 2.3 percent. In one of the more enthusiastic moments of Trump’s SOTU address, he said, “And exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.”
Democrats proceeded to stand up and clap. Cheers of “USA! USA!” also erupted.
“That’s great. Very great. And congratulations. That’s great,” Trump continued.
OutletName fact-checked Trump’s claim about having “more women serving in Congress than at any time before.”
“There are more women in Congress than ever before, but that is almost entirely because of Democrats, not Trump’s party. The number of Republican women in the House has, in fact, fallen from 23 in the last Congress to 13 in this one ,” their fact-check read. “Altogether, there are 127 women in Congress, up from 110 in 2018. But even with that large jump, women remain hugely underrepresented on Capitol Hill — less than 1 in 4 members of Congress is a woman. (Meanwhile, women are the majority of voters .)”
So, OutletName “fact-checked” the president’s statement about the number of women in Congress by saying that it’s a result of the opposition party, not that the statement he made was false.",1
586,"Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has taken to social media to denounce the executive order signed by President Donald J. Trump calling for the construction of a border wall and stronger security. Peña Nieto said that Mexico will not pay for the project.
During a short message that was posted on his Facebook page and a video message sent via Twitter, Pena Nieto informed his countrymen about the executive orders that would be focusing on immigration and the wall.
Un mensaje para todos los mexicanos: pic.twitter.com/EFcNh7fQtm — Enrique Peña Nieto () January 26, 2017
“As a response, I have ordered Mexico’s Foreign Ministry to redouble the protection measures to our countrymen,” Peña Nieto said. “The 50 Mexican Consulates in the U.S. will be turned into authentic defenders of the rights of migrants.”
Peña Nieto called on civil rights groups and legislators to team up and provide support for the protection measures.
“Where there is one Mexican migrant in risk that requires our support, that is where we need to be … that is where his country needs to be,” the Mexican president said.
During his message, Peña Nieto called out the executive order for the border wall claiming that it divides the two countries rather than unites them, especially at a time when trade and border security are top bilateral matters of discussion.
“Mexico does not believe in walls,” he said. “I have said it time and time again; Mexico will not pay for a wall.”
In his speech, Peña Nieto made no mention of the various Mexican drug cartels that have been responsible for the out-of-control violence along the border and the related human and drug trafficking. As OutletName Texas has reported, Mexican drug cartels have been protected by government officials at the highest levels, including two former border governors, that are current fugitives of the U.S. Department of Justice.

266,"President Trump slammed Democrats Tuesday, suggesting they want to “shut down the Government,” just days before the deadline, underscoring his non-negotiable campaign promise to build a “great WALL” along the U.S.-Mexico border.
“We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER, and we must have a great WALL to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.
Minutes later, he tweeted again, pushing for a “merit based” immigration system.
“The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military, at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now! No more dangerous lottery,” Trump tweeted.
On Friday at 11:59:59 p.m. ET, the funding to keep the federal government running expires. If congressional lawmakers cannot come to a bipartisan agreement, the government will close on Jan. 20—the one year anniversary of Trump taking office.
Congressional lawmakers, on both sides of the aisle, have punted a long-term budget solution, and have continued to pass just short-term stop-gap spending deals as they negotiate their policy must-haves.
The president has accused Democrats of blocking any agreement on a spending bill, due to their demands of preserving the Obama-era Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals—the program that protects immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children from deportation.
Republicans, though, are looking for increased defense funding, and for border security—including changes to the so-called Visa Lottery System and to “chain migration” programs. The president has argued that the wall along the southern border must be included in any comprehensive immigration reform deal.

670,"Vice President Mike Pence sat down with OutletName host Tucker Carlson on Thursday night and revealed that approximately 2,000 people are apprehended trying to enter the country illegally each day.
“I want the American people to know that this is a real crisis at our border. We made progress last year. It probably was a result of the fact that the American people elected a new president who delivered a very strong message about confronting illegal immigration. We actually saw a decline in illegal immigration and incursions on the southern border,” Pence began.
“In the last 12 months, we have literally seen a dramatic increase in the number. 2,000 people a day apprehended at our border or found to be inadmissible trying to enter our country,” he continued. “That represents, as much as we were all troubled about the caravans moving north and there’s talk about more caravans. Literally 2,000 people a day attempt to come into this country illegally by one means or another.”
The Vice President added, “We can agree on those facts, come together around solutions. But part of that solution means a wall, it means a barrier along our southern border. And it also means technology, drones, the kind of support that our border agents know will assist them in doing their job. But, bottom line, if there is no wall, there is no deal.” 
As Pence referenced, the president has been adamant that he would not agree to any deal to end the partial government shutdown if there is no money allocated for a wall along the southern border.",1
1382,"A new shelter for migrant teenagers who crossed the border alone in this small Texas town is only 10% full and the contractor running it concedes it may be “too much, too late.” “It should have been here in May, so kids weren’t in the Border Patrol jail cells,” said Kevin Dinnin, chief executive of BCFS, a privately run nonprofit operating the emergency influx shelter, which can house up to 1,300 teen boys and girls. He was referring to reports of children spending weeks in crowded cells built to hold adults for a few hours. As the migrant crisis on the U.S. border with Mexico intensifies, government agency leaders have been invited to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Here's a look at the conditions drawing scrutiny and the answers lawmakers will be seeking. Photo: AFP
Government officials have blamed a shortage of available shelter space for the fact that some children spent nearly a month in the cells, which lack basic amenities such as showers and have been widely criticized as unsafe. At the same time, some facilities built to hold children weren’t full or were being used for adults instead. More than 63,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border between October, the start of the government’s fiscal year, and June, the most since 2016. Illegal border crossings slowed last month, however. In May, about 300 children each day were being transferred from the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees border enforcement, to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement, which oversees care for unaccompanied minors. In recent weeks, transfers have dropped to about 150 a day, said Mark Weber, an HHS spokesman who was at the Carrizo Springs shelter Wednesday during a press tour. The Carrizo Springs shelter is one of 168 overseen by ORR, all operated by private contractors, currently housing about 12,000 children. On Wednesday, the Carrizo Springs shelter housed 223 teenagers in two dorm buildings. Mr. Dinnin said a third dorm is available and bed space can be quickly made available for about 1,000 additional teens. For the first 60 days the facility is open, BCFS will be paid up to $50 million, according to federal contracting records. The records show the contract could be worth as much as $300 million through January. The dorms, which previously housed oil workers, have three-bedroom suites, each with two sets of bunk beds and a private bathroom. The young residents have decorated the rooms with drawings, including some of family, and flags from their home countries, which include Guatemala and El Salvador. Amid the national outcry over conditions for migrant children in Border Patrol cells, BCFS has taken the unusual public-relations steps of offering members of the media weekly tours of the compound. Mr. Dinnin said elected officials will be allowed to visit the site any time they want. While many such facilities don’t advertise who is residing there, the fence ringing the shelter at the Studios at Carrizo Springs has signs explaining how they are treated. “All youth in this temporary shelter have prompt on-site access to medical care, mental health services,” the signs read, “as well as 3 meals and 2 snacks a day, telephone access, and daily scheduled activities pending their placement with families or sponsors.” Previously, most facilities for migrant children have been off limits to the public, save for a handful of tours given to journalists and elected officials following criticism of the conditions inside. “One of the requirements I gave HHS was the increased transparency,” Mr. Dinnin said. “There’s nothing to hide here.” A detailed schedule provided to reporters Tuesday featured classes in reading, math, social studies and science. During one class session, a teacher told dozens of girls she would be using music to help teach them English, explaining that she had learned to speak Spanish the same way. “Don’t be afraid of your accent,” the teacher told the class. “There are many different accents in this country.” In a separate class nearby, a group of dozens of boys practiced reciting the alphabet in English. The menus for meals included tacos on Tuesday with chicken mole for dinner Wednesday night. Recent scrutiny of poor conditions for children in Border Patrol cells has already brought attention to the new Carrizo Springs shelter. A small protest took place last week on the road to the facility. Employees at online home-furnishings retailer Wayfair Inc. staged a walkout last month at the company’s Boston headquarters in protest of its sale of $200,000 in bedroom furniture to BCFS for the new facility. Mr. Dinnin said he wants children to stay in the shelter in Carrizo Springs, two hours southwest of San Antonio, no more than 30 days. Children are typically released when ORR can identify a family member or sponsor qualified to take them in. Mr. Weber said HHS has reduced the length of the average stay from about 90 days late last year to about 45 days now. He said several changes have been made to help get children reunited with their families sooner, including eliminating a requirement that all parents and close relatives be fingerprinted before a child could be released. Hope Frye, a San Francisco-based immigration lawyer who has visited several child shelters and border stations to document conditions, said she believes ORR should do more to release children sooner. However, she added, she is heartened by transparency efforts at Carrizo Springs.",0
344,"In a new biography by Keith Koffler, OutletName News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon shares his reminiscences about Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, calling the tome one of his six most formative influences, and comparing America’s challenges to those to which our forebearers succumbed. “I’m not a multiculturalist,” Bannon relates in Bannon: Always the Rebel, explaining: America has “an underlying culture, that has been passed down from Jerusalem, to Athens, to Rome, to London. It’s the belief in self-reliance, it’s the belief in the self-determination of the individual. It’s freedom to be the traditional family. The culture that is our way of life. I think it’s absolutely vital and important. And we have an obligation to those that came before us as much as we have an obligation to the people in the future to pass that down.” The Romans, Bannon gleans from Gibbon, “[Are] the people most like us. … They built this great empire and how it all slipped away over time.” First published in six volumes between 1776 and 1789, the Englishman Gibbon’s work is a landmark of historical scholarship, setting the pattern for modern history writing. The Roman Empire was the greatest power the Western world had ever known, and its long shadow still cast noticeably over Gibbon’s enlightenment Europe. His flowery narrative of three centuries of decadence and decline that followed the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius featured prominently in the schooling of ten generations of school children and university students across the English-speaking world. Like much of the classical Western Canon, it began to fall out of favor in the latter twentieth century. Bannon, a devotee of the work, sees striking parallels in present-day America. Key to Gibbon’s depiction are the steady corrosion of the core virtues, and, while the term was still centuries from being coined, “social capital” of the Roman Empire by mass uncontrolled immigration, decadence among the elite, and the loss of cohesion around societal institutions with the rise of what Arnold Toynbee would describe – 140 years later – as the Empire’s “internal proletariat” of early Christianity. “You can see that power of Roman virtue, these Roman virtues of manliness, and service to the state. And that’s why everybody in the world wanted a part of that,” Bannon told Koffler of the state of affairs in Rome at its peak. That virtue, like the civic virtue of “melting pot”-era America, was enough to assimilate controlled immigration – the first waves of barbarians to the Roman citizenship 212 A.D.’s Edict of Caracalla granted them. But those barbarians came, in Gibbon’s view and Bannon’s, to overwhelm the capacity of the society to subsume them, like the unchecked mass of often-illegal third world immigration threatens to do to America today. And that “overrunning” of the Empire’s values at its frontiers was matched by the abandonment of them at its heart, among its elites. As Koffler relates of his conversation with Bannon: The Roman Senate “was bought and paid for by the elites. … The exact thing we face today!” he exclaimed. “What the Roman Empire faced is exactly what we face, that you lose the citizenship — and the power of citizenship — of the Roman Republic, you become an Empire, and that empire becomes a massive concentration of power and wealth, which is detached from the people. And then eventually, you’re having people who don’t want to serve in the legions, you have to go for foreign soldiers. Everybody is a mercenary. And therefore, no one really stood up or was prepared to die, really, in service to the country. And then what happened? Wave, after wave, after wave of migrations from the Goths, the Visigoths, the Huns. Coming into the empire and changing the culture and destroying the civic society they had in Rome. The empire could not withstand it.” According to the biography, other works of the Western Canon and Christian tradition from which Bannon draws inspiration for his worldview include Thomas à Kempis’s The Imitation of Christ, The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola, The Brotherhood of the Common Life and Its Influence by Ross Fuller, The History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides, and Plutarch’s Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans.",1
1305,"Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday praised plans by U.S. President Donald Trump’s new administration to build a wall on the Mexico border, saying his country’s own barrier on the Egyptian border had halted illegal immigration. “I built a wall along Israel’s southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration,” Mr. Netanyahu wrote on his official Twitter account, adding emoticons of the U.S. and Israeli flags. “Great success. Great idea.” Earlier this week, Mr. Trump ordered his government to start on building a wall on the border with Mexico, as he attempts to crack down on immigration. He has also imposed a ban on entry to the U.S. for people from certain Muslim-majority countries. Calls by the U.S. leader for Mexico to pay for the wall sparked a rift earlier this week with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, who canceled a planned trip to Washington. Mr. Netanyahu’s tweet drew criticism from the Mexican government and from Mexico’s Jewish community. The Foreign Relations Ministry expressed “profound surprise and disappointment” at the tweet. “Mexico is a friend of Israel, and should be treated as such by its prime minister,” it said in a statement, adding that “only yesterday” Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray presided over an event at the ministry to honor and remember victims of the Holocaust. The Jewish community in Mexico issued a statement rejecting Mr. Netanyahu’s message and expressing support for Mexicans living in the U.S. “As Mexicans and Jews we support the actions taken by President Enrique Peña Nieto in negotiations with the U.S.,” it said. The Israeli ambassador to Mexico, Jonathan Peled, tweeted in Spanish that the Israeli prime minister was “referring to our experience in security that we want to share, it does not express a position on the U.S.-Mexican relationship.” He added in a later tweet that the Israel-Sinai border—“a closed border that protects against terror with no exchanges of any kind”—isn’t comparable with the U.S.-Mexican border. Israel began the construction of a barrier fence on its border with Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula in 2012 in a bid to stem the flow of thousands of illegal African migrants entering the country. The Israeli government has since come under criticism for its treatment of some 45,000 African migrants, mostly from Eritrea and Sudan. It hasn’t deported the migrants but has refused to grant them asylum and detained thousands. Israel also has erected barriers around the Gaza Strip and along much of its border with the West Bank to protect against potential attacks from Palestinians. The Gaza barrier has been in place since the 1990s, while the West Bank barrier, which comprises wire fencing and concrete walls, was begun in 2002 and is still in the process of being completed. Messrs. Netanyahu and Trump spoke by phone on Jan. 22 as the two leaders attempt to reset relations between their countries. Mr. Netanyahu clashed with Mr. Trump’s predecessor, former President Barack Obama, who favored a separate state for Palestinians and pressured the Israeli prime minister to stop building on contested land. In December, the U.S. abstained from voting in at the United Nations Security Council on a resolution that condemned settlement construction in the West Bank and parts of Jerusalem, allowing it to pass. By contrast, the pro-Israel rhetoric from Mr. Trump’s administration has emboldened Mr. Netanyahu’s government. On Tuesday, Mr. Netanyahu approved the construction of 2,500 new homes in settlements in the West Bank, the largest such settlement expansion in recent years. Mr. Netanyahu plans to travel to the White House in early February to meet Mr. Trump in a visit expected to be closely watched by Israelis and Palestinians. The visit could alter policy on the Middle East peace process by encouraging the country’s right wing to drop the notion of a separate state for Palestinians. Former U.S. ambassador to Israel Daniel Shapiro criticized the Israeli leader’s comments, suggesting that Mr. Netanyahu was attempting to curry favor with the new U.S. president ahead of the meeting. “Hard to explain this intervention on a hotly debated issue in domestic U.S. politics,” Mr. Shapiro, who worked with the Obama administration before leaving his post earlier this month, said on his official Twitter account later Saturday. “To me, it looks like Trump is already squeezing Netanyahu hard.”",0
2131,"Many will have you believe that President Obama's 2011 immigration order is the same as President Trump's travel ban. Veuer's Nick Cardona has the story. Buzz60
President Trump signs executive orders at the Pentagon on Jan. 27, 2017. President Donald Trump defended his sweeping immigration policy by calling it “similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.” That’s a faulty comparison.
There was a delay in processing Iraqi refugees in 2011 after it was discovered that two Iraqi refugees living in Kentucky had been involved in roadside bombing attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq. One of the refugee’s fingerprints were found on a detonation device in Iraq, prompting U.S. immigration, security and intelligence agencies to use federal databases to rescreen about 58,000 Iraqi refugees in the U.S. and more than 25,000 Iraqis who had been approved to enter the U.S., but had not yet been admitted, Department of Homeland Security officials testified at the time.
The Kentucky case not only caused a backlog in processing Iraqi refugees in 2011, but it also resulted in an overhaul of the refugee screening process.
The Obama administration’s actions were limited to one country and in response to a specific threat — the potential for other Iraqi refugees to take advantage of a flaw in the screening process.
By contrast, Trump ordered a far wider ban — albeit also temporary — without identifying a specific threat.
President Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27 that bars Syrian refugees from entering the U.S. indefinitely and bars all other refugees for 120 days, and keeps out visitors for 90 days from seven predominately Muslim countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. Initially, as OutletName reported, administration officials said the ban also applied to U.S. green card holders re-entering the United States from those seven countries, though they could get a waiver to re-enter. But two days after Trump signed the executive order, administration officials said green card holders, who are permanent residents, would be admitted on a case-by-case basis after additional security screening.
Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said in a statement that “lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.”
The order caused confusion at the nation’s airports over the weekend as refugees, legal visa holders and visitors affected by the new policy were detained and some even sent back to their home countries. Democrats and someRepublicans criticized the Republican president for overreaching his authority and jeopardizing Muslim relations in the fight against terrorism.A day after Trump signed the order, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union won a temporary stay in federal court to allow those already in the U.S., or en route to the U.S., to remain in the country.
As a candidate, Trump called for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” But, in response to criticism of his executive order, Trump issued a Jan. 29 statement accusing the media of “falsely reporting” that it is a “Muslim ban.” Trump said his policy is “not about religion — this is about terror and keeping our country safe.”
Trump also drew comparisons to the Obama administration’s action on Iraqi refugees.
Trump, Jan. 29: ""My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months.""
But what Obama did was not a ban, and it did not involve visas.
Trump and the White House did not elaborate on the 2011 reference, but the conservative OutletName website posted a story the same day with the headline, “Flashback: Obama Suspended Iraq Refugee Program for Six Months Over Terrorism Fears in 2011.” Trump’s senior counselor and chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, is the former executive chairman of OutletName.
OutletName, Jan. 29: ""In 2013, OutletName first revealed that two years earlier, the State Department had imposed a freeze over the processing of Iraqi refugees for six months. The halt was the result of the discovery of two al-Qaida members admitted as refugees from Iraq who were living in Bowling Green, Kentucky and who had admitted to targeting U.S. troops in Iraq.""
That is an accurate summary of the OutletName article.
Iraqi refugees Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi settled in Kentucky after entering the U.S. in 2009. Alwan entered the U.S. in April of that year and Hammadi in July, according to the federal indictment.
Alwan was involved in planting and detonating IEDs against U.S. troops in Iraq from approximately 2003 to 2006, the Department of Justice said. OutletName reported that the FBI opened an investigation after receiving an intelligence tip that led them to Alwan, who then led investigators to Hammadi.
Alwan “had claimed to be a refugee who faced persecution back home — a story that shattered when the FBI found his fingerprints on a cordless phone base that U.S. soldiers dug up in a gravel pile south of Bayji, Iraq on Sept. 1, 2005,” OutletName wrote. “The phone base had been wired to unexploded bombs buried in a nearby road.”
The FBI set up a sting operation that led to the conviction of both Iraqi refugees on several charges, including attempting to provide support to terrorists in Iraq. The men were sentenced in January 2013.
“As a result of the Kentucky case, the State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told OutletName — even for many who had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets,” OutletName reported.
The case also “prompted the bureau to assign hundreds of specialists to an around-the-clock effort aimed at checking its archive of 100,000 improvised explosive devices collected in the war zones, known as IEDs, for other suspected terrorists’ fingerprints,” OutletName reported.
OutletName, Nov. 20, 2013: “ 'We are currently supporting dozens of current counter-terrorism investigations like that,' FBI Agent Gregory Carl, director of the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC), said in an OutletName interview to be broadcast tonight on OutletName’ 'World News with Diane Sawyer' and 'Nightline.' ""
At a congressional hearing on Sept. 13, 2011, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the Kentucky case resulted in an overhaul of the screening process.
Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said more than 58,000 Iraqi refugees had been admitted to the United States (since 2007), but more than 25,000 Iraqis at the time had been approved but not yet admitted and resettled. Collins asked Napolitano “is there a hold on that population until they can be more stringently vetted to ensure that we’re not letting into this country people who would do us harm?”
Napolitano would not use the word “hold,” but explained that tens of thousands of Iraqi refugees already in the U.S. had to be rescreened and Iraqi citizens in the future would undergo a tougher screening process.
Napolitano, Sept. 13, 2011: ""Yup. Let me, if I might, answer your question in two parts. First part, with respect to the 56, 57,000 who were resettled pursuant to the original resettlement program, they have now all been revetted against all of the DHS databases, all of the NCTC [National Counter Terrorism Center] databases and the Department of Defense’s biometric databases and so that work has now been done and focused."" Collins: ""That’s completed?"" Napolitano: ""That is completed. Moving forward, no one will be resettled without going through the same sort of vet. Now I don’t know if that equates to a hold, as you say, but I can say that having done the already resettled population moving forward, they will all be reviewed against those kinds of databases.""
On July 13, 2011, Rand Beers, undersecretary for the National Protection and Programs Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security, testified at a Senate hearing that it had rescreened about 58,000 Iraqi refugees already living in the United States, but the rescreening process had caused a backlog. Beers said that “it was not an easy process because it required some database adjustments and interactions that we had not even tried before.”
At a congressional hearing on Jan. 7, 2014, a homeland security official said the screening process was strengthened as a result of the Kentucky case.
“Following the May 2011 arrest of Mohanad Hammadi and Waad Ramadan Alwan in Kentucky, DHS and DOS have worked closely with the Intelligence and Law Enforcement communities to enhance our screening regime for refugee resettlement applicants,” Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary Molly Groom said.
“While the exact details of these new checks are classified, we are prepared to provide a classified briefing to members should there be interest in this information,” Groom said. “While no screening is infallible, we believe that current screening systems to vet refugee applicants are more likely today to detect individuals with derogatory information should they apply.”
The new screening process for Iraqi refugees in 2011 reduced the number of Iraqi refugees admitted that year.
In calendar year 2011, the U.S. admitted only 6,339 Iraqi refugees — down from 18,251 in 2010, according to the State Department’s refugee admissions database. The number of Iraqi refugees jumped to 16,369 in 2012 after the screening systems were changed.
Trump’s comparison of his immigration actions to Obama’s policy in 2011 is a faulty one. The fact is that the Obama administration was responding to a known and specific threat from one country and limited its response to refugees from that country, while Trump’s order temporarily bans refugees from all countries — indefinitely in the case of those from Syria — and temporarily bars all other visitors from seven predominately Muslim countries.",0
1310,"President Trump stands behind his campaign promise to build a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexican border. On the campaign trail, he insisted he could get the job done for no more than $10 billion because he is the master of completing construction projects quickly and under budget. This past weekend the president took to Twitter to lash out at reports that the true cost of the border wall would be well north of $10 billion. The critics are almost certainly correct. Mr. Trump fails to take into account the major hurdle the wall faces: eminent domain. To build the wall, the U.S. would need to own all 1,954 miles of the border. Most of this land is now private property—especially in Texas, where the U.S. government owns only 100 miles of the 1,254-mile border. To acquire the rest of the land it would need, Washington would need to employ eminent domain, the authority under the Fifth Amendment to seize private property for public use upon payment of “just compensation.” Recent history shows that’s easier said than done. In 2006 Congress passed the Secure Fence Act with strong bipartisan backing, including the support of New York Democrat Chuck Schumer, now Senate minority leader. The law authorized construction of a border fence along 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border, including 100 miles in Texas. Lawmakers expected swift completion of the project. Instead, a decade later, there are unfenced gaps—because the fence had to have holes to accommodate local ranchers whose cattle graze on the southern side, but also due to property owners’ fighting land seizures in federal court. At the end of 2016, more than 120 separate cases pertaining to eminent-domain seizures for the fence were still active in the U.S. court system. In 2009 the Department of Homeland Security inspector general issued a report that noted, “Acquiring real property from non-federal owners is a costly, time-consuming process requiring negotiations and sometimes condemnation.” The cost of paying landowners “fair market value” is often higher than estimated. In building the border fence, OutletName reported, the U.S. government ended up paying $4.7 million for one developer’s land when the initial offer was $233,000. After originally proposing $114,000 for another parcel, the government shelled out $1 million to settle a lawsuit alleging that the fence’s construction had diminished the value of the conservancy’s land. The high cost is a feature, not a bug. The Fifth Amendment is part of the Bill of Rights, and while it recognizes the government’s authority to condemn land, its purpose is to protect property owners from confiscation. How could Mr. Trump overcome this obstacle? He may be a great negotiator, but for logistical reasons alone it’s unlikely he can personally make a deal with each of the hundreds, if not thousands, of landowners who’d turn to the courts to resist the seizure. And his own record in this regard isn’t promising. In the 1990s he failed to persuade Vera Coking, an Atlantic City, N.J., widow, to sell her house on the site of a proposed Trump Plaza parking lot. The city’s Casino Reinvestment Development Authority attempted to force her out using eminent domain, but Mrs. Coking prevailed in court. The president is right to focus on border security. At present, it is quite easy to enter the U.S. illegally. But an estimated 40% of illegal aliens entered the U.S. legally and overstayed their visas. A wall would do nothing about those overstays. Thus Mr. Trump would be prudent to move away from a physical wall to one that is “virtual” or “electronic.” That would entail investing in electronic surveillance equipment such as drones and motion sensors that the Border Patrol could use to enhance its operations. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could also expand the E-Verify system, which checks aliens’ employment eligibility, to track the location of foreign visitors and reduce visa overstays. Surely Mr. Trump has the persuasion skills to sell his supporters on this tough but practical approach. It would also earn him the backing of Democrats from border areas and even some of the Democratic base. More important, the president would avoid seizing Americans’ private land—a policy that is anathema to the conservatives who overcame their doubts to vote for him.",0
572,"The nation’s new pro-American immigration policies will help Mexicans as well as Americans, President Donald Trump told the nation today.
“It is going to be very, very good for Mexico,” he told a cheering audience at the headquarters of the Department of Homeland Security. “Our relationship with Mexico is going to get better and better,” he said Jan. 25, shortly after he signed orders ending a series of pro-migration policies established by President Barack Obama.
Trump’s emphasis on the benefits to both Americans and Mexicans flips the standard script pushed by progressives who argue that Trump’s pro-American policies are motivated by hostility towards foreigners, including Mexicans and Central Americans.
At the DHS, standing beside Gen. John Kelly, the new DHS chief, Trump declared:
The unprecedented surge of illegal migrants from Central America is harming both Mexico and the United States, and I believe these steps … starting right now, will improve the safety in both countries … A nation without a border is not a nation.
The policy of firm borders will be used to increase “economic opportunity on both sides” of the border, Trump said, after describing the northward flow of drugs and criminals.
“I want to emphasize that we will be working in a partnership with our friends in Mexico to improve safety and economic opportunity on both sides of the border,” he said, adding “I have deep admiration or the people of Mexico.”
He continued:
We are going to save lives on both sides of the border, and we also understand that a strong and healthy economy in Mexico is very good for the United States. Very, very good. We want that to happen.
Trump’s support for Mexicans living in Mexico is popular among his supporters.
Thirty-three percent of Trump supporters have a positive view of Mexican immigrants in the United States — but 75 percent of his supporters also have a positive view of “Mexicans living in Mexico,” according to an October 2016 survey. That positive view of Mexicans-in-Mexico is shared by 80 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of all Americans, and 82 percent of Democrats, leaving Trump’s supporters with similar generous attitudes as other Americans towards foreigners living in their own countries.
Trump’s new pro-border policies are furiously opposed by globalist progressives.
“President Trump’s fantasy of sealing the border with a wall is driven by racial and ethnic bias that disgraces America’s proud tradition of protecting vulnerable migrants,” claimed Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. Jadwat continued, according to a ACLU statement:
The DHS deportation force has a track record of racial profiling and excessive force abuses, and expanding it will further erode the rights of millions of people who call our safe border communities home. Locking up asylum seekers who pose no danger or flight risk is unconstitutional and benefits nobody except private prison corporations and politicians looking to score rhetorical points. We will see the Trump administration in court if they go down that road.
Pro-American immigration reformers, however, welcomed Trump’s new policies, even as they also called for action to curb many other pro-migrant policies established by Obama.
Top of the list is a law requiring companies to check that possible hires are allowed to work in the United States.
The reformers also want Trump to deploy a visitor-tracking system so that officials know when legal visitors, such as tourists or temporary workers, have left the country. The system would help reduce the number of “overstay” illegal workers. Congress has repeatedly authorized the deployment of the tracking system since the 9/11 atrocity, but has not provided the needed funds. In 2015 roughly 500,000 foreign visitors overstayed their visas, according to a government report.
The reformers also want Trump to reverse Obama regulations which sharply increased the inflow of foreign while-collar professionals who compete for professional jobs sought by young American graduates.
Trump is coming under criticism from pro-American immigration reformers for not immediately stopping the renewal of two-year work permits given to roughly 750,000 illegal immigrants by Obama’s 2012 quasi-amnesty.
Throughout his term, Obama increased the inflow of legal immigrants so much that his agencies brought one migrant into the United States for every two births during the first half of 2016, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. For much of his tenure, Obama’s agencies annually imported one million new legal immigrants plus one million foreign contract workers, even as 4 million young Americans annually entered the job market. By a lopsided margin, most Americans believe companies should hire Americans before hiring additional immigrants.
Trump’s pro-American policies are mostly opposed by business groups and by many GOP leaders, especially House Speaker Paul Ryan. The GOP’s leadership tend to favor a business-friendly high-immigration, low-wage economic strategy. For example, Ryan has repeatedly argued that business needs a steady supply of foreign blue-collar workers and white-collar professionals about the four million Americans who join the labor force each year, and that foreign workers are needed to prevent any wage increases for American workers.
The current inflow of cheap foreign workers cuts’ Americans salaries and effectively transfers roughly $500 billion a year from pay packets into investors’ profits, according to calculations by Professor George Borjas, a Harvard researcher.

2337,"In declaring a national emergency at the Southwest border, President Donald Trump strung together a long list of false, misleading and unsupported claims on illegal immigration, drug smuggling, human trafficking, trade deficits and other issues.
We briefly cover some of the statements the president made in his Feb. 15 Rose Garden remarks – nearly all of which we have debunked numerous times before.
‘Catch-and-release’
Trump said: “We have a real problem. We have catch-and-release. You catch a criminal, and you have to release him.”
The facts: That’s not accurate. The U.S. does not have to release criminals; in fact, it is required to detain certain criminals.
Those attempting to enter the U.S. without “valid entry documents” or “by fraud or misrepresentation” must be detained pending an expedited removal proceeding, as explained in a 2018 report by the Congressional Research Service. And they are subject to deportation whether they have a criminal record or not.
Now, some people apprehended trying to cross the border illegally (or legally for that matter) may seek asylum in the U.S., a process that can stretch for years in some cases. The immigrant must first get a U.S. official to determine that he or she faces a “credible fear” of prosecution or torture if forced to return home, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If an asylum officer doesn’t find there’s a credible fear, the immigrant can request a review by an immigration judge. If the judge agrees with the officer, the immigrant can then be removed from the U.S.
Even for those who have passed this initial “credible fear” threshold, they still must have a formal asylum hearing, which can take years. But authorities are under no obligation to release those awaiting a long-term removal proceeding.
In fact, ICE is required to hold certain criminals, including those who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, those who have multiple criminal convictions, and those who have served more than a year in jail for a criminal offense. That’s spelled out in the Immigration Nationality Act, Section 236 (c).
Those apprehended near the border who have committed a less serious offense and who are deemed not to pose a risk to public safety, can be released pending the long-term proceeding. But authorities are not obligated to do so, especially if they are deemed a risk to public safety, Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told us.
“There is no obligation to release anyone,” Pierce said.
‘Chain migration’
Trump said: “You have chain migration. Where a bad person comes in, brings 22 or 23 or 35 of his family members – because he has his mother, his grandmother, his sister, his cousin, his uncle – they’re all in. You know what happened on the West Side Highway. That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured – nobody talks about that – horribly, like loss of legs and arms. … He had many people brought in because he was in the United States. It’s called chain migration.”
The facts: Trump is referring to Sayfullo Saipov, a Uzbekistan national who has been charged in a 2017 terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people and injured 11 others. Trump hasrepeatedlyclaimed that Saipov used “chain migration” to bring 22 people with him into the United States. There’s no evidence that Saipov brought even one relative to the country.
Saipov came to the U.S. in 2010 through theDiversity Immigrant Visa Program, according to the Department of Homeland Security. As a green card holder, Saipov could not have sponsored anyone other than a spouse and children, and he married in the United States in 2013 – so he could not have been responsible for bringing in the relatives cited by Trump. Saipov’s father and mother – Habibullo Saipov and Muqaddas Saipova – were living in Uzbekistan at the time of the attack, as reported by the Daily Mail and the OutletName.Diversity immigration visa
Trump said: “And then you have the lottery. It’s a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, they’re not putting you in; they’re putting some very bad people in the lottery. It’s common sense. If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to the United States, I’m not going to put in my stars; I’m going to put in people I don’t want. The lottery system’s a disaster. I’m stuck with it.”
The facts: The president hasrepeatedlymisrepresented how the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program works. Under the program, the Department of State randomly selects up to 50,000 qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Contrary to Trump’s claim, countries do not “put in people” for visas; the individuals themselves apply. And those selected in the “lottery,” as Trump calls it, must pass an extensive background check before they are given green cards, or legal permanent resident status.
There are more than a dozen grounds of inadmissibility, including health issues, criminal activity, national security concerns and the “likelihood of becoming a public charge,” meaning “a person who is primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.” That’s all done in an attempt to prevent “very bad people,” as Trump called them, from getting into the country.
Southwest border apprehensions
Trump said: “So we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we’ve ever had before.”
The facts: The number of people who try to enter the U.S. illegally each year is unknown, but federal authorities use the number of apprehensions to gauge changes in illegal immigration. Southwest border apprehensions totaled 396,579 in fiscal year 2018, which was up from 303,916 in fiscal 2017. Still, the 2018 figure is down 76 percent from the peak of 1.64 million apprehensions in fiscal 2000, according to Border Patrol data. (For more, see our updated story, “Illegal Immigration Statistics.”)Illegal drugs at the border
Trump said: “But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border. When you look and when you listen to politicians – in particular certain Democrats – they say it all comes through the port of entry. It’s wrong. It’s wrong. It’s just a lie. It’s all a lie.”
The facts: The Drug Enforcement Administration– not just “certain Democrats” – say that Mexican cartels “transport the bulk of their drugs over the Southwest Border through ports of entry (POEs) using passenger vehicles or tractor trailers.” This is particularly true for heroin and fentanyl – two opioids that Trump mentioned in his remarks. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection drug seizure statistics for fiscal year 2018, which ended Sept. 30, 2018, 90 percent of heroin seizures occurred at legal ports of entry in the first 11 months and 80 percent of fentanyl in the first 10 months. “A small percentage of all heroin seized by CBP along the land border was between Ports of Entry,” the DEA said in its 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment.
Last month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection made thelargest fentanyl bustin its history when a Mexican national “attempted to enter the United States through the Port of Nogales.” Border agents discovered nearly 254 pounds of fentanyl worth about $3.5 million “concealed within a special floor compartment of a trailer that was laden with cucumbers.” Trump has been making this claim since 2017 and, most recently, in this month’s State of the Union address.
Human trafficking at the border
Trump said: “If you’re going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you’re going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don’t have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again.”
The facts: There’s no data on how many are smuggled illegally across the border with Mexico for human trafficking, as we said in our story when Trump made a similar claim in his State of the Union address. But experts told us legal ports are the typical mode of entry in the bulk of the cases they deal with concerning foreign nationals. A spokesperson for Polaris, which operates the National Human Trafficking Hotline, told us “the vast majority of people are coming through legal ports of entry.” That’s based on statistics the group has compiled from the calls it receives through the hotline.
In addition, the United Nations’ International Organization on Migrationhas foundthat “nearly 80% of international human trafficking journeys cross through official border points, such as airports and land border control points,” based on 10 years’ worth of cases on which the IOM has assisted.
Paying for the border wall
Trump said: “And, by the way, the USMCA, from that’s United States, Mexico, Canada – that’s where the money’s coming from, not directly, but indirectly, for the wall. And nobody wants to talk about that.”
The facts: The White House has sought as much as $25 billion for the wall, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection has estimated that it will cost $18 billion in the first 10 years of construction. The president has made the claim – which we have debunked onmanyoccasions– that the revenue generated from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, will indirectly pay for the wall. But the White House has provided no analysis to support the president’s claim, and trade experts we interviewed said it’s not possible.
The agreement – which was signed by the leaders of all three countries in November, but has yet to be approved by Congress – represents an arguably slightly better deal for the U.S. than the current North American Free Trade Agreement, experts told us, but not enough to generate enough federal revenues to pay for the wall. Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told us the additional revenue could not “cover annual maintenance and improvements of the wall much less the original build.”
‘Wall’ construction, so far
Trump said: “I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn’t need to do this. But I’d rather do it much faster. And I don’t have to do it for the election. I’ve already done a lot of wall for the election – 2020.”
The facts: Despite the president’s claim that he has “already done a lot of the wall,” little new fencing has been constructed, and none of it is the type Trump promised during the campaign. As we have written, Congress last year approved $1.6 billion to replace existing barriers and add some fencing in new areas. But Congress stated that the money can only be used to build “operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, [May 5, 2017] such as deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety.” That language prohibits the administration from building any of the wall prototypes that the administration had designed and that the president toured last year in California.
Although the administration says the $1.6 billion appropriated last year will fund 100 miles of “wall,” we calculated that there would be about 40 miles of new barriers, which have yet to be completed, while the rest is for upgrades to existing barriers. And the 100 miles of barriers is far short of the 722 miles of new and replacement barriers that the administration has said it plans to build.
Crime in El Paso
Trump said: “The other night I was in El Paso. We had a tremendous crowd and – tremendous crowd. And I asked the people, many of whom were from El Paso … I said, ‘Let me ask you the – as a crowd, when the wall went up, was it better?’ You were there, some of you. It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.”
The facts: Trump continues to peddle the false claim that construction of a fence in El Paso transformed the border city from one of the most dangerous in the country to one of the safest. Those from El Paso in the crowd may have agreed with the president, but as we have written, crime statistics from the FBI contradict the president’s narrative.
El Paso has never been one of the most dangerous cities in the country. The city had the third lowest violent crime rate among 35 U.S. cities with a population over 500,000 in 2005, 2006 and 2007 – before construction of 57 miles of fencing started in the El Paso sector in mid-2008. Nor was there an “immediate” or “overnight” drop in violent crime in El Paso after the fence was constructed, as the president has said. In fact, the city’s violent crime rate increased 5.5 percent from 2007 to 2010 – the years before and after construction of the fence, which began in mid-2008 and was completed in mid-2009. Looking from 2006 to 2011 – two years before the fence construction began and two years after it was finished – the violent crime rate increased about 9.6 percent.
El Paso murders
Trump said: “In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall. And they had 23 murders. It’s a lot of murders. But it’s not close to 2,000 murders, right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico. So everyone knows that walls work.”
The facts: There were 1,247 murders in Juarez, Mexico, in 2018, according to El Diario, while just across the border, El Paso police reported 23 murders. But that’s not evidence that “walls work.” While there has long been a high number of murders in Juarez, the number of murders in El Paso has remained relatively low among U.S. cities, both before and after the fence.
In 2007, the year before construction of the fence began, there were 336 homicides in Juarez compared with 17 in the city of El Paso. In 2008, a war between drug cartels in Juarez sent the number of homicides in the Mexican city soaring to 2,570. Yet across the border in the city of El Paso, the number of homicides remained at 17, according to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program.
In 2010, the year after the fence was completed, the number of homicides dropped to 5 in El Paso, before climbing back up to 16 in 2011 and 23 in 2012. Most recently, the city of El Paso recorded 17 homicides in 2016 and 19 in 2017. Those figures are in line with those before the fence went up. The city averaged 15.2 homicides a year in the five years between 2003 and 2007.
Total trade deficit
Trump said: “You saw last month, the trade deficit went way down.”
The facts: Trump made this same misleading claim at a rally in El Paso, Texas, this week. It’s true that the monthly goods and services trade deficit was $49.3 billion in November, down $6.4 billion from $55.7 billion in October, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis figures. But the October trade deficit was the highest monthly deficit in 10 years. Also, the November monthly figure was still higher than it was at the same point in 2017 and 2016.
Overall, the trade deficit is up 20.3 percent for the 12 months ending in November, compared with 2016, the year before Trump took office.
Trade deficit with China
Trump said: “We’ve been losing on average $375 billion a year with China. Lot of people think it’s $506 billion. Some people think it’s much more than that.”
The facts: Trump has been exaggerating the U.S. trade deficit with China since the 2016 election. The goods-and-services trade deficit with China averaged almost $222 billion between 1999 and 2017, according to BEA data. The deficit with China was $275 billion through the first three quarters of 2018, which is the most recent BEA data available. ",0
2139,"Demonstrators urge to protect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program rally outside the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein in Los Angeles. SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge on Tuesday night temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s decision to end a program protecting young immigrants from deportation.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup granted a request by California and other plaintiffs to prevent President Trump from ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program while their lawsuits play out in court.
Alsup said lawyers in favor of DACA clearly demonstrated that the young immigrants “were likely to suffer serious, irreparable harm” without court action. The judge also said the lawyers have a strong chance of succeeding at trial.
DACA has protected about 800,000 people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children or came with families who overstayed visas. The program includes hundreds of thousands of college-age students.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in September that the program would be phased out, saying former President Barack Obama had exceeded his authority when he implemented it in 2012.
More: In extraordinary public negotiation with Congress, Trump promises to sign DACA bill
The move sparked a flurry of lawsuits nationwide.
Alsup considered five separate lawsuits filed in Northern California, including one by the state and another by the governing board of the University of California school system.
During a court hearing on Dec. 20, the judge grilled an attorney for the Department of Justice over the government’s justification for ending DACA, saying many people had come to rely on it and faced a “real” and “palpable” hardship from its loss.
Alsup also questioned whether the administration had conducted a thorough review before ending the program.
Brad Rosenberg, a Justice Department attorney, said the administration considered the effects of ending DACA and decided to phase it out over time instead of cutting it immediately.
DACA recipients will be allowed to stay in the U.S. for the remainder of their two-year authorizations. Any recipient whose status was due to expire within six months also got a month to apply for another two-year term.
The Justice Department said in court documents that DACA was facing the possibility of an abrupt end by court order, but Alsup was critical of that argument.
People took out loans, enrolled in school and even made decisions about whether to get married and start families on the basis of DACA and now face “horrific” consequences from the loss of the program, said Jeffrey Davidson, an attorney for the University of California governing board.
“The government considered none of this at all when they decided to rescind DACA,” he said at the hearing.
DACA recipients are commonly referred to as “dreamers,” based on never-passed proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act that would have provided similar protections for young immigrants.",0
2613,"U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, under intense questioning from Democratic senators, said on Tuesday she did not hear President Donald Trump use a vulgarity to describe African countries during an impassioned White House meeting last week.
Nielsen’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee echoed statements she has made since the meeting on Thursday with Trump and Republican and Democratic legislators, which roiled the debate on an immigration law deal and generated accusations of racism toward Trump.
Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, who attended the meeting, said Trump used the word “shithole” to describe African countries but Nielsen, also who participated in the meeting, said she did not hear that.
In one of the hearing’s most dramatic moments, Democratic Senator Cory Booker grew emphatic after Nielsen said she did not want to answer more questions about the language at the meeting.
“When Dick Durbin called me I had tears of rage when I heard about this experience in this meeting,” Booker told her.
“Your silence and your amnesia is complicity,” he said.
Trump has said Durbin misrepresented his comments. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who also was at the meeting, issued a statement last week that did not dispute news accounts that Trump used the vulgarity to describe African countries. During the hearing Graham did not ask Nielsen about Trump’s comments, but described Durbin as a “decent, honest man.”
Nielsen said she did not remember Trump categorizing African countries in a specific way.“The conversation was very impassioned. I don’t dispute that the president was using tough language,” Nielsen said, adding that several people in the room were using profanity.
The comments have complicated the debate over an immigration deal to protect immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children, and also overshadowed larger spending negotiations ahead of a possible federal government shutdown this week.When asked about Trump’s reported statements about preferring immigrants from Norway, Nielsen said Trump was using Norway as an example of a country whose citizens work hard.
Nielsen also was asked about the administration’s decision to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era policy to protect from deportation immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. Trump ended the program in September, giving Congress six months to find a permanent solution.
Nielsen said she did not believe Trump would have the authority to extend the March 5 deadline for the ending of the program. On Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security said it would resume accepting DACA renewals, after a federal judge blocked Trump’s decision to end the program.
Nielsen also testified about a DHS study on the link between immigration and terrorism. The report, issued on Tuesday, said about 73 percent of the 549 individuals convicted of “international terrorism-related” charges in U.S. federal courts between Sept. 11, 2001, and Dec. 31, 2016, were born outside the United States.
In a briefing call with reporters, a senior administration official pointed to the report as evidence that the United States needs to reform its immigration system, including to eliminate the diversity visa lottery and extended family-based immigration, in favor of high-skilled immigrants.
But the official said the administration was not ready to release statistical information on the manner of entry of the individuals convicted.",0
256,"President Trump said Tuesday that a “drone flying around” will not stop the new migrant caravan that is moving from Central America toward the U.S. border with Mexico, doubling down on his claims that “Only a Wall will work.”
“A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras. Tell Nancy and Chuck that a drone flying around will not stop them. Only a Wall will work. Only a Wall, or Steel Barrier, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!” Trump tweeted early Tuesday.
The president’s tweet comes on day 25 of the partial government shutdown, which has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors without pay. The shutdown began on Dec. 22, over a border security funding battle between the White House and congressional Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
NEW MIGRANT CARAVAN LEAVES HONDURAS FOR JOURNEY TO US BORDER
The president requested $5.7 billion in funding toward border security and construction of a wall or physical barrier along the border, while Democrats vowed to block any request for wall funding.
Last week, the president mentioned the new caravan and said “we’re trying to break it up.” But the caravan of at least 500 migrants began its journey from Honduras to the U.S. border late Monday, members of the group told OutletName.
The caravan left the northern city of San Pedro Sula earlier than expected. The group consists of a mix of people that included some mothers carrying their young children on their shoulders. As they walked, some migrants pleaded with local store owners to give them food or water for their journey, according to The Associated Press.
TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON BORDER WALL, AS POLLS SHOW VOTERS TURNING AGAINST HIS SHUTDOWN STRATEGY
The president has continued to sound the alarm over the immigration flow along the border, saying that it amounts to an “invasion,” and called it “far worse” than people understand after he visited the front-lines in Texas last week. Trump has repeatedly called it a “humanitarian crisis”—one that Democrats have claimed he “manufactured.”
Meanwhile, the president has continued to say the public is with him as he tries to shift blame for the shutdown to the Democrats.
“Democrats will soon be known as the Party of Crime. Ridiculous that they don’t want Border Security!” Trump tweeted Tuesday.
But as more than 800,000 federal workers missed their first paychecks, fresh polling suggests the president is losing the battle of public opinion.
A Quinnipiac University poll released Monday found that 63 percent of voters agree with the Democratic proposal to reopen parts of the government that do not involve border security, with 30 percent opposed. The same poll founded 63 percent also oppose using the shutdown to force wall funding, with just 32 percent supporting.
The poll found that 56 percent of American voters blame Trump and Republicans in Congress for the partial shutdown, compared with 36 percent who say Democrats are responsible.
Neither side is showing any sign of budging, with Trump continuing to insist on upwards of nearly $6 billion for a border wall and Democratic leaders saying they will not entertain a wall in this spending package.
OutletName’ Dan Gallo, Edward DeMarche, Andrew O’Reilly and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",1
554,"Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer suggested that he offered a concession on the border wall to President Donald Trump during their midday White House meeting before Democrats shut down the government’s 2018 budget at midnight.
“In exchange for strong DACA protections, I reluctantly put the border wall on the table for discussion,’ Schumer said on the Senate floor as he tried to blame Trump for the Democrats’ near-unanimous move to block a procedural vote, so preventing the GOP from passing the government budget with 51 votes.
Schumer did not provide any details on his wall offer. For example, Schumer did not say if he promised the Democratic Party’s endorsement for Trump’s $33 billion, 10-year plan for construction and operation of a wall, or if he was just willing to declare his personal support for a few billion dollars for future construction of a wall.
Many Democrats strongly oppose a border wall as a supposed “trophy” for Trump — but also because it is a symbolic distinction between the United States and other countries. Democratic groups and business groups also oppose the wall because it would hinder the northward flow of cheap-labor migrants to Democratic-run low-wage cities on the coasts.
Trump rejected his wall offer, said Schumer. “When President Trump is ready … Democrats will be ready,” he added.
In 2006, Congress voted for the construction of a 700-mile wall but later refused to provide the funding. That lack of funding has ensured the 2,000-mile border is shielded by only a short stretch of double-layer fencing.
The Democrats’ “Gang of Six” group, led by Schumer’s deputy, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, has offered an amnesty plan to Trump, which Trump rejected. The plan offered $1.5 billion in exchange for an amnesty. But the amnesty would be far bigger and more expensive than the 1986 amnesty, which was said to be for 3 million illegals.
The Gang of Six’s amnesty would cover at least 5 million foreigners, including at least 3 million young illegals, their parents, and 400,000 additional migrants, pus a large but unclear number of their chain-migration relatives. Few of the migrants would have university degrees, and so most would get more in taxpayers’ aid than they would pay in taxes.
Schumer tried to blame the shutdown on Trump and he pushed the claim that Trump does not know what he wants on immigration policy. He said:
Republican leadership can’t get to yes because President Trump refuses to. Mr. President, President Trump, if you are listening, I am urging you: please take yes for an answer.
House Democratic Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi also tried to blame Trump for the Democrats’ shutdown.",1
2247,"President Trump’s choice to become Labor secretary acknowledged Monday that he employed an undocumented immigrant for years, an admission that has derailed other Cabinet nominees in the past, according to published reports.
OutletName reported late Monday that Andrew Puzder admitted in a statement that he had hired an undocumented household worker for years.
“My wife and I employed a housekeeper for a few years, during which I was unaware that she was not legally permitted to work in the U.S.,” Puzder said in a statement to the network. “When I learned of her status, we immediately ended her employment and offered her assistance in getting legal status.”
He added: “We have fully paid back taxes to the IRS and the state of California and submitted all required paperwork.”
Reports that Puzder had hired an undocumented immigrant first appeared Monday in The OutletName.
Sen. Lamar Alexander, who chairs the committee that will hold Puzder’s confirmation hearing, said the revelation should not automatically disqualify Puzder from the Cabinet post.
“Based upon what I’ve learned, since Mr. Puzder reported his mistake and voluntarily corrected it, I do not believe that this should disqualify him from being a Cabinet secretary,” said Alexander, a Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
Puzder’s confirmation hearing before the panel had been scheduled for Tuesday. But the committee announced last week it was delaying the hearing to allow him to complete his paperwork and to give senators enough time to review it.The delay marked the fourth time Puzder’s hearing has been postponed. A new hearing date has not been set.
Puzder, who lives in Franklin, Tenn., outside Nashville, is the chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. fast-food chains. He served as a senior economic adviser during Trump’s campaign and in 2012 was an economic adviser for the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney.
Puzder has drawn intense fire from labor unions and other groups over his opposition to raising the minimum wage and over questions about low wages and other workplace practices at his restaurants. He also has criticized a now-halted rule enacted under President Obama that would have expanded eligibility for overtime pay to 4 million Americans.
His revelation that he employed an undocumented worker is certain to bring more criticism and further complicate his confirmation prospects.
In 2001, President George W. Bush’s choice for Labor secretary, Linda Chavez, withdrew her nomination amid reports that she had employed an undocumented immigrant a decade earlier.
In 1993, Zoe Baird withdrew her nomination to become Bill Clinton’s attorney general after revelations that she had hired undocumented help and had failed to pay taxes on them. ",0

2124,"Thousands of people protest President Trump's immigration ban on citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries outside the White House in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 29, 2017. Forty-eight hours after President Trump signed an executive order temporarily banning immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, chaos reigned at U.S. airports, as authorities, travelers and lawyers struggled Sunday to understand how the ban is being implemented.
Attorneys for civil rights and immigration advocacy groups said Customs and Border Protection agents are interpreting Trump's orders differently. At some international airports, including Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas, all people who were detained have been allowed to enter the United States. At others, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York's JFK International Airport, lawyers said an undetermined number of travelers remained in custody.
Three federal courts — in New York, Virginia and Boston — have issued rulings since Saturday night to protect people who were in transit to the U.S. when the order went into effect Friday and got caught in legal limbo. The ban affects people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
The Department of Homeland Security said that as of Saturday night, 109 people had been detained, but it has yet to follow through on a New York judge's order to release a list of all people still being detained, including travelers who may have arrived on U.S. soil Sunday.
The result? ""Mass confusion,"" said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project who argued the case in New York. ""The government took no steps to make sure that people understood what the order means and how it should be implemented. (Trump) just threw it out there without ensuring that it would be implemented fairly and even-handed and properly.""
The White House and Homeland Security countered that they provided new guidelines to agents working at airports and that only a small fraction of travelers were affected by the order. On Saturday, when asked about the roll-out of his executive order, Trump said ""it's working out very nicely."" And several White House officials appeared on Sunday talk shows to say that civil rights groups were blowing the confusion out of proportion.
So where do things really stand?
A ruling issued late Saturday by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York barred Customs and Border Protection officials across the country from deporting any immigrants, including refugees and legal immigrants from the seven predominantly Muslim countries targeted in Trump's order, so long as they hold a valid visa. That order dealt only with immigrants who had already arrived in the U.S. or were already in transit.
Homeland Security said it would comply with that order, but made clear it would continue carrying out Trump's executive order, meaning they will try and stop any other refugees or legal immigrants from the seven countries listed in the president's order from heading to the U.S.
Lawyers will soon begin arguing the overall legality of Trump's executive order, a possibly weeks-long process that will ultimately determine whether the order is allowed to stand.
But much remains unclear.
Part of the problem has been the lack of information coming from the departments of Homeland Security and State.
The first official mention of the new guidelines to appear online came from an Arabic-language Twitter account run by the State Department. It sent out three tweets on Saturday instructing citizens from the seven countries listed in Trump's order not to travel to the U.S., pay any visa fees or show up for visa interviews. The tweets did not mention, however, that those with permanent resident status — or green-card holders — from those countries are still allowed to enter the U.S.
Homeland Security said it provided new guidance to all of its port officials immediately after Trump signed the order, and updated its computerized targeting system to identify those people. But the department did not start providing guidance to travelers until Sunday.
Hundreds of protesters in Boston chanted and held signs opposing President Trump's executive order banning all refugees and citizens of seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the U.S.
Homeland Security's first tweet came early Sunday, which linked to the department's statement declaring that it would carry out Trump's order and that ""prohibited travel will remain prohibited."" There was no guidance on which travelers should stay home and no clarification of how the order affected green-card holders.
It wasn't until Sunday night that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly declared that he had deemed ""the entry of lawful permanent residents to be in the national interest."" That leaves refugees and people entering the country on temporary visas, such as for business and tourism, barred from entering the country.
The web sites of both agencies made no mention of the new order as of Sunday evening.
Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, echoed the sentiments of many Republicans when he praised Trump for his executive order, arguing that the U.S. vetting system was overdue for an overhaul. But he criticized the way it’s been carried out.
""(The administration) failed to provide clear guidance on the policy which caused substantial confusion at the ports of entry,"" Labrador said. ""Inadequate review and poor implementation of this executive action threatens to undermine otherwise sound policy.""",0
336,"Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents rescued a Honduran migrant after he nearly died from dehydration after illegally crossing the Rio Grande. Agents assigned to the Eagle Pass South Station began tracking a group of illegal immigrants who crossed from Mexico into Texas on June 6. The agents eventually came upon a 24-year-old man lying on the ground. The agents determined the man to be suffering from dehydration and immediately summoned Border Search, Trauma, and Rescue (BORSTAR) agents who were working nearby, according to information obtained from Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials. The BORSTAR agents arrived on the scene and immediately began treating the man for heat-related injuries. The BORSTAR agents stabilized the man who would have likely died had the agents not found him. The agents litter-carried the man for a quarter-mile through the brush where they met up with a local ambulance. The ambulance crew transported the man, identified as a Honduran national with no legal authorization to be in the U.S., to a nearby hospital for “more advanced treatment.” “The majority of people attempting to illegally enter this country are ill-prepared for the treacherous terrain they face,” Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul L. Ortiz said in a written statement. “Had our agents not been out patrolling the remote areas of our border, this man would have most likely died from exposure.” U.S. Border Patrol Chief of Law Enforcement Operations Brian Hastings told reporters during a press call on Wednesday that the number of rescues of migrants is increasing dramatically this year. “So far this fiscal year, the men and women of the Border Patrol have done over 3,000 rescues,” Hastings told the reporters. “We’ve seen a massive increase in the amount of water-related rescues that are taking place — primarily in Del Rio, RGV, and Laredo’s areas of operation.” “Water-related rescues alone have gone up 907 percent this fiscal year,” the chief explained. “They’ve (the rescues) have gone from 51 in Fiscal Year 18 to 514 during Fiscal Year 19. That means, a lot of times, risking their lives to save the lives of others.”",1

The video shows the group of illegal immigrants, including what appears to be minors, climbing down and dropping from the border wall after being assisted by a human smuggler on the Mexican side with a ladder. The migrants used the ladder to reach the top of the outdated fencing technology that is being replaced in many other sections of the border. They then climbed down or dropped from the top of the wall.
Yuma Sector officials told OutletName News on Thursday that 118 migrants in total crossed in this incident. Of those, the majority were Family Unit Aliens from Guatemala.
The Yuma Sector is seeing massive exploitation of the weaknesses of the existing border fencing in recent weeks as the government remains partially shut-down over funding for new border barriers. The location of this particular crossing was about 1.5 miles west of where a large group of 376 migrants recently exploited the fencing technology by digging underneath the outdated fencing.

In a dramatic late-night session, senators blocked a bill to extend government funding through Feb. 16. The bill needed 60 votes in the 100-member Senate but fell short, with only 50 supporting it.
Most Democrats opposed the bill because their efforts to include protections for hundreds of thousands of mostly young immigrants known as Dreamers failed.
Huddled negotiations by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer in the last minutes before midnight were unsuccessful, and the U.S. government technically ran out of money at midnight.
The shutdown formally began on Saturday, the first anniversary of President Donald Trump’s inauguration.
Trump immediately sought to blame Democrats.
“Tonight, they put politics above our national security, military families, vulnerable children, and our country’s ability to serve all Americans,” the White House said in a statement.
It also said it would not discuss immigration until the government is up and running again.
“We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands. This is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators.”
In return, Schumer pointed the finger directly at Trump.
“It’s almost as if you were rooting for a shutdown and now we’ll have one and the blame should crash entirely on President Trump’s shoulders,” he said.
Until a funding deal is worked out, scores of federal agencies across the country will be unable to operate, and hundreds of thousands of “non-essential” federal workers will be put on temporary unpaid leave.The Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a stopgap funding measure on Thursday. But Republicans then needed the support of at least 10 Democrats to pass the bill in the Senate. While five Democrats ended up voting for the measure, five Republicans voted against it.
Democratic leaders demanded that the measure include protections from deportation for about 700,000 undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers who arrived in the United States as children.
Despite bipartisan negotiations, Republican leaders refused to include those protections, and neither side was willing to back down. McConnell and Schumer insisted they were still committed to finding an agreement that restores government funding as soon as possible.
Trump, who had made strict measures on immigration a cornerstone of his presidential campaign, last week rejected a bipartisan proposal, saying he wanted to include any deal for Dreamers in a bigger legislative package that also boosts funding for a border wall and tighter security at the U.S. border with Mexico.Schumer met with Trump on Friday afternoon and later said he had reluctantly agreed to include the border wall in the negotiations but that it still was not enough to persuade Trump to find a compromise.
Schumer also called on Trump and leaders of both parties to resume negotiations on Saturday.
McConnell said he would seek a new funding bill through to Feb. 8 but a Senate Democratic source said that was too far out. Democrats had argued for an extension of four or five days to force both sides into serious negotiations on the immigration issue.
In a shutdown, “essential” employees who deal with public safety and national security would keep working. That includes more than 1.3 million people on active duty in the military who would be required to work but would not be paid until funding is renewed or handled with separate legislation.
Although past government shutdowns have done little lasting damage to the U.S. economy, they can rattle financial markets.
This impasse follows a months-long struggle in Congress to agree on government funding levels and protections for Dreamers, most of whom are originally from Mexico and Central America.
They were given temporary legal status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program started by former President Barack Obama.
In September, Trump announced he was ending the program and gave Congress until March 5 to come up with new legislation.",0
316,"Young Republicans and President Trump supporters are the most skeptical of the United States’ mass legal and illegal immigration policy, a new Harvard poll finds.  The latest Harvard Insitute of Politics (IOP) Youth polls reveals that Trump’s youngest supporters — 18 to 29-year-olds — and young Republican voters are largely skeptical of immigration and its benefits that are routinely touted by big business interests, corporate executives, and the open borders lobby.  The poll discovered that nearly 4-in-10, or almost 40 percent, of Republican voters between 18 and 29-years-old said they disagree that recent immigration to the U.S. has done more good than harm. Similarly, about 41 percent of Trump supporters in that age bracket said the same.  Only about 26 percent of young GOP voters and young Trump supporters agreed that recent immigration has been a net bonus to the U.S. The Harvard IOP Youth poll found that young people, overall, were split on whether the country’s national immigration system — which admits more than 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants annually — was a benefit or not to Americans. While 31 percent of young people said they believed recent immigration has done more good than harm, nearly 30 percent disagreed. Roughly 37 percent said they neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement. Young swing voters were more likely than not to disagree that immigration has done more good than harm to the U.S., and among young white voters, about 35 percent said they disagreed that recent immigration has been a net positive for the country. Less than 30 percent of young white voters said the opposite. Young American college graduates, specifically, have been subjected to competing against a growing number of foreign visa workers that businesses and corporations import to take high-paying, professional jobs every year. Through the H-1B visa program, alone, businesses last year attempted to outsource nearly 420,000 U.S. professional jobs — many in the STEM fields — to foreign workers. The poll comes as Trump gears up for his 2020 re-election bid amidst soaring illegal immigration levels at the U.S.-Mexico border and a mass legal immigration policy that has yet to be reformed.",1
790,"Brad Parscale, the campaign manager for President Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign, thanked OutletName’s Jim Acosta for making the case for a border wall Thursday.
Acosta traveled to McAllen, Texas to cover the presidential visit there and, as he awaited Trump, recorded a video of himself wandering along the border. “We’re not seeing any imminent danger,” Acosta says in the video as he walks the border fence. “There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence. No sign of the national emergency the president has been talking about.”

“I found some steel slats down on the border. But I don’t see anything resembling a national emergency situation,” Acosta tweeted.
Conservatives noted the hypocrisy of the tweet. Among them was Parscale, who wrote, “I would like to thank Acosta for pointing out how peaceful, safe and secure it is at a part of the border that HAS a wall.”

803,"You may have read the news that there is a heated election recount taking place in Florida — again.
Eighteen years after the nation held its breath while a presidential election result was delayed for over a month, accusations of vote-counting improprieties are being hurled over contested Sunshine State races for senator, governor and agriculture commissioner.
Unlike the recount of 2000, this standoff has cast a spotlight on a very dangerous and existential threat to our democracy: non-citizen voting.
Though their side later denied it, it has been documented that lawyers for Florida Democratic gubernatorial and Senate candidates objected to the rejection of a provisional ballot cast by a non-citizen. To those who might say “big deal,” it’s actually a very big deal.
For the record, it is illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections. Federal law clearly states it here, here and here. Illegal immigrants found to have voted in federal elections are subject to fines, imprisonment and deportation, and are deemed ineligible to receive visas or allowed entry into the United States.
Isn’t this really about cold-hearted, nativist Americans being mean to foreigners? Hardly.
The integrity of our elections is one of the fundamental principles of our nation. Allowing non-citizens to vote devalues U.S. citizenship. It cancels out the votes of American-born and naturalized citizens and is an insult to those who lawfully participate in our elections.
Non-citizen voting also weakens American values.
What exactly does our country gain by allowing foreign nationals to decide who will lead us? Do those foreign nationals have any understanding of the founding principles that made America exceptional? Do they revere our uniquely American heritage that holds sacred the concepts of liberty, individualism and free speech? Probably not.
More than likely, they come from places where corruption, rigged elections and repression of basic human rights are accepted as the norm.
Without assimilation and taking the proper steps toward citizenship, those people are also vulnerable to the charms of unscrupulous politicians who dangle easy access to government handouts in exchange for ever-expanding government and the loss of individual freedoms. That path leads to a very bad place for the country, its citizens and its immigrants.
Not surprisingly, non-citizen voting is all the rage among those in America’s anti-borders movement. While the practice is illegal at the federal level, there are no such restrictions for elections at the local and state levels.
Many of the same places that gave us sanctuary cities and states are now seeking non-citizen voting rights. San Francisco has started the process, allowing non-citizens to vote in school board elections.
Boston is seriously considering the idea of allowing non-citizen voting in municipal elections. Given California’s zeal for all things illegal immigration — sanctuary laws, tipping off aliens before ICE operations, et al. how long will it be until illegal aliens have full voting rights in the Golden State? The smart money is on “not long at all.”
Other communities have employed a more devious, back-door approach to non-citizen voting. Take Chicago, which this year approved a new identification card for illegal aliens in the city.
“Undocumented workers” need an ID card for basic needs in the city, its supporters would argue. Then comes the twist: the ID cards will be accepted as a valid form of identification to register to vote, available to all Chicago residents regardless of immigration status or criminal record. Citizens of the world, you too can now determine who runs Chicago.
These cases and many more show how advocacy for non-citizen voting creates an opportunity for large-scale voter fraud. That’s why the Immigration Reform Law Institute has been relentless in its efforts to ensure integrity in our voting procedures.
Last year, for example, we filed an amicus curiae brief in the Supreme Court in support of a lower court decision in Fitzpatrick v. Sessions. The U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals had decided to expel from the United States a non-citizen who falsely stated that she was a U.S. citizen on a voter registration form and illegally voted in two elections.
If such flagrant violations of our election laws are not vigorously prosecuted, the damage to the integrity our republic will be incalculable.
What is currently taking place with the Florida recount is shameful. The presidential election recount in 2000 was decided by 537 votes. With each vote in states like Florida critical to the outcome, we can’t afford a single illegal vote.
Even in this increasingly polarized political climate, we should at least be able to expect our elections to be decided by U.S. citizens and no one else. Often, people fail to act on an issue because they feel it does not directly affect them. This is not one of those issues.
Demand voting integrity or live with destructive consequences.

319,"There are now more illegal aliens giving birth to anchor babies in the Los Angeles, California metro area than there are total United States births in 14 states and the District of Columbia. New wide-ranging analysis by the Center for Immigration Studies‘ Steven Camarotta reveals that there are an estimated 28,000 births to illegal aliens every year in the Los Angeles metro area, exceeding the total number of U.S. births in 14 states and the District of Columbia. The children of illegal aliens are commonly known as “anchor babies,” as they anchor their illegal alien and noncitizen parents in the U.S. and eventually are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country through the process known as “chain migration.” About 1-in-5 U.S. births — or 791,000 — are to legal and illegal immigrant mothers, with legal immigrant mothers accounting for about 12.4 percent of those births and illegal alien mothers accounting for 7.5 percent. In the Los Angeles, California metro area, illegal alien births make up nearly 18 percent of all births in the region. In the Las Vegas, Nevada metro area, illegal alien births account for about 17 percent of all births. California — a sanctuary state for illegal aliens — has the largest number of illegal alien births with about 65,000 illegal alien births every year. Texas has about 51,000 illegal alien births every year, while Florida has about 16,000 illegal alien births every year. There are an estimated 12 million illegal aliens living across the U.S. at any given time. Most recent research by Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, revealed that there is likely an estimated 22 million illegal aliens in the U.S. Additionally, every year, 1.5 million legal immigrants are admitted to the country.",1
2554,"The U.S. Justice Department asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to quickly overturn a lower court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump’s move to end a program that protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children.
Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in a court filing “time is of the essence” and asked the high court to rule on the case before its current term ends in June.
The Republican president in September rescinded, effective in March, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program put in place in 2012 by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump asked the Republican-controlled Congress to come up with a legislative fix, which it has not yet done.
A variety of Democratic state attorneys general, organizations and individuals challenged Trump’s action in multiple federal courts.
The administration is challenging a Jan. 9 decision by San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who ruled that DACA must remain in place while the litigation is resolved.
The Justice Department did not file an emergency application that, if successful, would result in the judge’s ruling being put on hold within days. That means the program will remain in effect until the Supreme Court resolves the case.
A decision could take more than a year if the court takes up the case but declines to speed up resolution of it issuing a ruling in its current term.
About 800,000 young, mostly Hispanic adults dubbed “Dreamers,” have been protected from deportation and allowed to work legally in the United States since the program was implemented. As of September, when the most recent figures were made available, 690,000 young adults were protected under the program.
Alsup’s ruling came during negotiations between Trump and congressional leaders over immigration policy. Those talks fell apart after Trump rejected a bipartisan deal and provoked outrage with his reported use of vulgar language to describe African countries in a meeting with lawmakers on immigration.
The Justice Department’s move to go directly to the Supreme Court is unusual because the administration is essentially seeking to circumvent the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which previously ruled against it over Trump’s temporary travel bans on people entering the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries.",0
401,"The Pentagon is preparing in case President Donald Trump orders the military to build the southern wall, according to a defense official.
Trump has hinted in recent days that he may do so, amidst an impasse in negotiations with Democrats that has shut down the government.
“I may declare a national emergency dependent on what’s going to happen over the next few days,” Trump told reporters on Sunday.
While no order has been given, the Pentagon has been making plans just in case such an order comes down, the official said on Monday.
The idea of declaring a national emergency to have the military build the wall has been considered since fall, the official revealed.
Some money could come from unobligated funds for military construction projects in 2019, the official said. “Unobligated” means that the funds have been authorized for a certain purpose, but for whatever reason, have not yet been used.
The Army Corps of Engineers would likely be in charge of overseeing the construction.
The organization would not build the wall itself, but would subcontract the project out, and then inspect it to make sure it meets specification and Defense Department standards.
While most Democrats have claimed Trump did not have the authority to order the military to build the wall, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Adam Smith (D-WA) acknowledged Sunday that the president does have the authority.
“There is a provision in law that says the president can declare an emergency. It’s been done a number of times. But primarily it’s been done to build facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq,” he said Sunday on OutletName’s “This Week.”
A Pentagon spokesman told reporters in December in response to queries: “Congress has provided options under Title 10 U.S. Code that could permit the Department of Defense to fund border barrier projects, such as in support of counter drug operations or national emergencies.”
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan is unlikely to oppose any such order for the military to build the wall.
After a Cabinet meeting last week on the border, he praised the Army Corps of Engineers for its work so far in restoring fences and the “building out of additional mileage for the wall.”
“The Army Corps of Engineers is dialed in on doing this cost-effectively, quickly, and with the right amount of urgency as to where we can build additional standup walls quickly and then get after the threat. The threat is real. The risks are real. We need to control our borders,” he said.
But Smith and a number of other Democrats say they are opposed to the idea, and that Trump would be open to legal challenges.
“In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, where is the emergency? You have to establish that in order to do this. But beyond that, this would be a terrible use of Department of Defense dollars.”
The president is slated to give a nationwide Oval Office address on Tuesday evening on the border situation, and is expected to travel to the border on Thursday.
Defense officials say they will be monitoring to see if a declaration of national emergency comes during those events this week.
Separately, the Department is slated to announce an extension of troops serving at the border by the end of this week.
Military support to the border was extended through January 31 by former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and it is expected to be extended again.
There are approximately 5,000 who are helping border patrol agents secure the border. Trump ordered the deployment ahead of at least two migrant caravans that were headed to the United States from Central America.",1
79,"Illegal immigrant families received nearly $1.3 billion in Los Angeles County welfare money during 2015 and 2016, nearly one-​quarter of the amount spent on the county’s entire needy population, according to data obtained by OutletName. The data was obtained from the county Department of Public Social Services -- which is responsible for doling out the benefits -- and gives a snapshot of the financial costs associated with sanctuary and related policies. The sanctuary county of Los Angeles is an illegal immigration epicenter, with the largest concentration of any county ​in the nation, according to a study from the Migration Policy Institute. ​The county also allows illegal immigrant parents with children born in the United States to seek welfare and food stamp benefits. Robert Rector, a Heritage Foundation senior fellow who has written extensive studies on poverty and illegal immigration, said the costs represent “the tip of the iceberg.” He said the costs of education, police and fire, medical, and subsidized housing can total $24,000 per year in government spending per family, much more than would be paid in taxes. “They get $3 in benefits for every $1 they spend,” Rector said. The Trump presidency’s hardline immigration policies, though, may be playing some role in curtailing the population seeking welfare payments in recent months. The same stats show Los Angeles County is expected to dole out $200 million less this year than in 2016, and several thousand fewer families are collecting benefits. “The number of entrants nationwide is going down. The population is static if not shrinking,” Rector said. The welfare benefit data from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services shows: During the first five months of 2017, more than 60,000 families received a total of $181 million.
Welfare and food stamp costs for the county’s entire population were $3.1 billion in 2015, $2.9 billion in 2016 and $1.5 billion so far in 2017.
Roughly a quarter of California’s 4 million illegal immigrants reside in Los Angeles County. In 2013, California spent a total of $25.3 billion on illegal immigrants – or $2,370 per U.S. citizen household, according to a 2013 study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform. Texas and New York were second and third, at $12.1 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively. Former state Republican Party Chairman Shawn Steel blasted Los Angeles policies but credited Immigration and Customs Enforcement with stepping up deportations. “The amazing thing is that everyone was expecting a big wall to stop [illegal immigration],” he said. “The decrease has been enhanced dramatically by ICE agents just doing their job.” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a proponent of the city’s sanctuary status, is a driving factor behind expanding immigrant benefits. He founded the Office of Immigrant Affairs shortly after taking office in 2013 to help immigrants navigate the maze of government benefits. “Immigration is at the heart of LA’s story,” he said in a written statement. “LA’s become one of the world’s great cities by embracing immigration and diversity and we’ll continue supporting anyone who wants to work hard and invest in our future – no matter who they are, where they came from or what language they speak.”",1
2364,"Right-wing firebrand Michelle Malkin delivered a fiery speech on immigration in which she slammed moderate Republicans, including the ""ghost of John McCain,"" at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington on Friday.
Malkin painted immigration, both legal illegal, as an invasion and an existential threat to America. And she did not just blame Democrats for the problem.
""It's the GOP sell-outs, not just the radical, open-borders left, that is in bed with immigration saboteurs,"" she said. ""Like the ones who hijacked the tea party movement to shill for amnesty. Those are the real grifters cashing in and practicing deceit at the expense of their base and at the expense of our country.""
Malkin cited a number of immigration policies that she believes demand reform such as granting visas to migrants' family members and the process that allows migrants to apply for asylum or refugee status.
""Both parties are to blame,"" she said. ""And yes, I'm looking at you, retired Paul Ryan, and yes, I'm looking at you, Mitch McConnell,"" she added, referring to the former Republican House speaker from Wisconsin and the current Senate majority leader from Kentucky.
""And yes, I'm looking at you, Bush family, and yes, I'm looking at you, the ghost of John McCain,"" she continued with a gesture toward the ceiling. The line drew a standing ovation from the audience.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., died in August from brain cancer. Former President George H.W. Bush died in November. McCain, Bush and former President George W. Bush all advocated a comprehensive immigration approach with increased border security and a path to citizenship for migrants who had already entered the country illegally. Immigration opponent like Malkin deride such a policy as ""amnesty"" for those migrants' immigration violations.
""How is it that we have Republicans on Capitol Hill that are doing the bidding of the Dreamer movement?"" Malkin said of the effort to protect from deportation undocumented migrants who arrived in the U.S. as minors. ""What about our dreams?""
Malkin is Asian-American but said she ""identifies"" as a ""proud, unhyphenated, unapologetic, fully assimilated American."" She said that critics had called her ""white"" because of her views.
""I'm not white, I'm just right,"" Malkin said.
She said that migrant families like hers who ""revere the rule of law"" are ""being replaced by militantly unassimilable and hostile generations"" of ""future Democrat voters whose tribal allegiance to the left has only hardened over time.""
Malkin said that ""from the comfort of TV green rooms and Beltway back rooms and corporate board rooms and conference ballrooms, it may not look like civil war is imminent.""
But she said conservatives are under attack in what she called the ""Disunited States.""
""The divide in this country is between decent people, who stand up for America, and dastardly people who want to bring America to its knees,"" she said.
""Diversity is not our strength – and I know those words are a 'trigger,'"" Malkin concluded, echoing a phrase that has been used by controversial figures like Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. ""Diversity is not our strength, unity is.""",0
2225,"Many will have you believe that President Obama's 2011 immigration order is the same as President Trump's travel ban. Veuer's Nick Cardona has the story. Buzz60In defending his executive order banning immigration and travel from certain countries, which has touched off widespread anger and confusion, President Trump compared the order to action taken by the Obama administration in 2011.
“My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months,” Trump claimed.
Obama administration officials and fact checkers say the claim is wrong.
Trump’s order banned visitors from seven Middle Eastern countries — Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Sudan and Syria — from coming to the United States for 90 days. The executive order signed Friday also suspended for 120 days all refugees coming to the United States.
In 2011, the State Department significantly slowed the number of visas it issued to Iraqis in order to review its vetting process. The concern stemmed from the arrests of two Iraqi refugees on terrorism charges in Bowling Green, Kentucky, in 2011. One of the men was linked through fingerprints to an improvised explosive attack in Bayji, Iraq.
The arrests triggered concerns in the administration and on Capitol Hill and led to a massive review of Iraqi refugees already admitted to the country and more extensive vetting of those applying to immigrate to the United States. The action only applied to refugees from Iraq.
Jon Finer, an Obama administration official, said the review slowed the pace of Iraqis coming into the United States, but never completely halted it.
The “flow of Iraqi refugees slowed significantly during the Obama administration’s review,” Finer wrote in an article for Foreign Policy magazine’s website, but “there was no outright ban.”
But in 2012, the flow of refugees from Iraqi had returned to close to pre-2011 numbers.
Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post’s fact checker, gave the Trump claim “three Pinocchios,” indicating a “significant factual error.”
He cited several differences between the Obama administration action and Trump’s recent executive order:
Obama’s action was in response to a specific threat, it was not a complete halt of refugees from Iraq and it did not apply to all visitors from Iraq entering the United States, he said.",0
182,"A 32-year-old is suing San Francisco, alleging that the city violated its sanctuary city ordinance by reporting him to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after reporting his car stolen in 2015.
Pedro Figueroa Zarceno, who is from El Salvador and lives in the Mission District, was in federal immigration custody for two months. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that it is prohibited in the city to use local resources to help federal law enforcement.
“With an incoming federal administration threatening mass deportations and targeting sanctuary cities, we must hold SFPD and the Sheriff’s Department accountable and ensure that every single officer is following the city’s due process protections,” Saira Hussain, an attorney representing Figueroa, told the paper.
The suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court, seeks an unspecified amount and calls on police to admit that he was a “victim of false imprisonment.”
A spokesman from the city reportedly said that San Francisco has “strong policies in place to encourage victims and witnesses to report crimes without fear of being deported.” The report pointed out that in February, then-Police Chief Greg Suhr acknowledged that the man should not have ended up in custody.
The report said that Figueroa reported the car stolen in November 2015.
Authorities eventually found the car, and when he filled out the paper work to pick up the car, he was arrested.
Homeland Security told the paper that police ran the background check and learned that he had a 10-year-old, outstanding warrant for deportation after failing to appear at an immigration hearing in Texas in 2005, and a 2012 conviction for drunken driving, authorities told the paper.
His attorneys told the paper that he planned to file for asylum and intended to go through the hearing process. He reportedly did not hear from authorities about the matter again. And his attorneys told the paper he had no idea there was an outstanding warrant.",1
363,"An open letter to the Hollywood Elite and the rest of America: My Dear friends and colleagues, I have recently been pondering President Trump’s executive action with regard to our nation having extreme vetting and our immigration policy finally being enforced. It has pained me deeply to see such a violent reaction to something that, to my mind, makes absolute common sense. Let me begin by saying that I am from a family of immigrants that came to this country for a better life. They came to the US “legally,” assimilated, integrated, and learned English to the best of their ability, and demanded we speak it. As we all know, we live in a time in which there are forces who wish to destroy our way of life. There are thousands of illegal immigrant criminals in the United States whose country of origin will not take them back. These criminals are free on the streets of America. We have recently heard from a plethora of Hollywood stars on this issue — Meryl Streep, Robert DeNiro, Ashley Judd, Madonna, major agencies, musicians, singers and even the indomitable Shia LaBeouf. After much prayer on this issue, I must now stand in solidarity with all of my Hollywood elite brethren. They are right! The rest of you are wrong! It is now in this spirit that I make an appeal to all in Hollywood and the media for us to use the Oscars to take a stand for the entire world to see and hear. It is time for Hollywood to lead the way. I propose that Meryl Steep, Chelsea Handler, Richard Gere, Robert DeNiro, Christoph Waltz and others lead an Oscar first: let’s do away with the rules, barriers, and tickets to the Oscars and after-parties, such as the swanky Vanity Fair party or the Weinsteins’ star-studded affair. I ask all migrants, all illegal immigrant criminals and all un-vetted refugees to converge on Hollywood to come to the Oscars and all the after-parties, even those held at the mansions or the Chateau Marmont or anywhere else. After all, we in the Hollywood community want to show all Islamic extremists that we have love in our hearts — and what better way to do that than by inviting them along on our most important night? It’s time the walls and electronic security gates come down. There are roughly 3,600 seats to the Oscars; we should have at least 2,500 seats reserved for illegal aliens, refugees and migrants, or maybe even more. For those celebrities skipping the ceremony, each should invite at least 100 illegal aliens, refugees or migrants to come to their home to watch the Oscars with them. The Academy and the Vanity Fair people should also get the 150 criminals who have recently been deported from Los Angeles and bring them to the show as honored guests. I find it curious that when President Obama did the same exact thing — and more — in terms of enforcing the law on illegal immigration, the Hollywood elite were silent. Why were they silent then, but are so vocal now when President Trump is doing basically the same thing? Is Hollywood racist? Why — when Christians are being slaughtered in Syria, Iraq, and other places in the Middle East — is Hollywood silent? Of course, the people that wish death upon Christians, Jews, gay people and the West are greeted with open arms by the elite in Hollywood — so why can’t they come to our Oscar parties? Additionally, I am now pleased to announce that Hollywood and the recording industry no longer require the protection of the Men in Blue at any of their events! We do not need a country of laws; only a country of illegal immigrants, refugees and migrants. How dare we ignore the words inscribed on the Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…” So now, we ask you all: please come to the Oscars on February 26th at the Dolby Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. We welcome you to our homes with open arms and love in our hearts. Together, let us celebrate the Progressive left and its policies, which have helped make blue collar America Tired, Hungry, and Poor. And the Oscar goes to… With love in my heart,",1
1449,"In “The Immigration Dodge” (Review, March 25) Mark Krikorian discusses the possibility of American culture being overwhelmed by an increase in immigration. He describes the evolving self-identification of second-generation teenagers from simply American to foreign-national identity or pan-racial identity, blaming the American education system’s teaching of civic education and multiculturalism for this change in identification as well as the social distrust found in diverse communities. As an 18-year-old born and raised in America by immigrants, I am proud to identify myself as Asian and Chinese-American. I do this because despite my 18 years in this country, and the 30-plus years of my parents’ being here, I will never belong in the undeniably white normative culture of America. Our political system, popular culture and definition of national culture constantly reflect the whiteness of our country. Insulating our country against multicultural acceptance through immigration reform won’t foster stronger communities. Rather, the rhetoric needs to change to allow for those already in this country to better assimilate and feel a sense of belonging. That starts with accepting our changing demographics and reshaping the narrative of this nation to encompass the experiences of ethnic minorities. By propagating a stricter immigration policy laced with nativist rhetoric, the social dysfunction and lack of belonging for the diverse populations that already exist in this country is magnified as immigrants feel less and less that they can belong here. As a nation built by immigrants, we must not protect against difference, but rather re-envision what America could accomplish when we work together. Grace Wong Portland, Ore. The social fabric of American society has been torn asunder, in large part because there is now no national American identity (or even national language, e.g., press 1 for English, 2 for Spanish). Israel is another country that has taken in people from all over the world with different language and cultures, but universal service in the Israel Defense Forces is arguably the most important institution in molding an Israeli society. People in Israel have skin in the game because they or close family members are fully integrated into Israeli society. Mr. Krikorian talks of 43 million foreign born living in the U.S., almost half of them naturalized citizens. But how many of these are dual citizens (a concept I abhor) who have divided loyalties and aren’t “all in” in America? I am stridently against any need-based aid, indeed any aid, to those I consider “other,” which includes all of those I don’t consider sufficiently assimilated into American life. This would include many American born, which is another powerful argument against birthright citizenship. I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Krikorian’s call for reduced immigration, but I would go even further. As President Trump might put it, “forgotten America” wants its country back; this can never happen with unchecked immigration, both legal and illegal, almost all of which is from the Third World, which has made the U.S. unrecognizable to me. Although the businesses both large and small that are the beneficiaries of this wealth transfer won’t like it, how about an effective halt to almost all immigration until we can figure out what is going on? Michael G. Brautigam Cincinnati Mark Krikorian frames immigration policy as a choice about protection. Immigration policy is primarily about opportunity: not the opportunity America offers to immigrants, but the opportunity for people brave, persistent and hopeful enough to immigrate offer America. While we benefit from the best and brightest—which has been our policy in employment-based immigration since 1990—immigrants’ real contribution is their belief in American ideals and values, which many of us born here take for granted. We didn’t achieve world-leader status by cowering in fear of the new and different. Sure, the road to e pluribus unum is rocky and always has been. As an immigration lawyer in practice more than 25 years, I can attest that current law already embodies choices and numerical limits that are strictly enforced. Extralegal results are caused by cynical political failure to adjust those choices when the focus on “merit” was no longer sufficient for our economy and demographics. While immigration isn’t a panacea, it is an immutable component of the American experiment. Lori Chesser Des Moines, Iowa In support of his argument to limit immigration, Mr. Krikorian misleadingly cites my research on the consequences of immigration. In research published in 2007, I provided empirical evidence for three major points: 1. Increased immigration and diversity are not only inevitable, but over the long run they are also desirable. Ethnic diversity is, on balance, an important social asset, as the history of the U.S. demonstrates. 2. In the short to medium run, however, immigration and ethnic diversity challenge social solidarity and inhibit social capital. 3. In the medium to long run, on the other hand, successful immigrant societies like the U.S. create new forms of social solidarity and damp the negative effects of diversity by constructing new, more encompassing identities. Mr. Krikorian deftly cherry-picks the middle point but entirely ignores the first and last because they are inconvenient for his policy recommendations. Mr. Krikorian is entitled to his own opinions, and he is entitled to cite or not to cite relevant scholarship, but he isn’t entitled to distort the findings of research that he chooses to cite. In my 2007 article, I specifically warned against this danger: “It would be unfortunate if a politically correct progressivism were to deny the reality of the challenge to social solidarity posed by diversity. It would be equally unfortunate if an ahistorical and ethnocentric conservatism were to deny that addressing that challenge is both feasible and desirable.” Mr. Krikorian’s tendentious use of my research illustrates precisely how our civic culture, which he claims to value, is being undermined in today’s public dialogue.

752,"No single issue can fire up a national debate quite like anything related to immigration — particularly during the Trump era.
When President Trump decried the doctrine of birthright citizenship on the campaign trail in 2015, it sparked a national debate, with many on the Left and Right issuing ad hoc condemnations.
When news broke Tuesday that the president is considering ending birthright citizenship with an executive order, many of these same voices, once again, condemned the president, claiming birthright citizenship is indeed constitutional.
But if this were true, why wasn’t the 14th Amendment applied to illegal or temporary immigrants prior to the 1960s?
The doctrine of birthright citizenship — the idea that citizenship is granted merely by being born within the geographic limits of the United States — is nowhere to be found in the Constitution.
The 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, also known as the Civil War Amendments, were promulgated to protect the newly freed slaves and to emphasize that they are, in fact, citizens of the United States and privy to the same natural and constitutional rights as any other citizen.
It’s no coincidence that the citizenship clause is within the 14th Amendment that also includes the Equal Protection Clause.
Prior to the amendment, state citizenship automatically conferred national citizenship. After the conclusion of the Civil War, however, the states decided to nationalize citizenship out of fear that some states would not recognize the newly freed slaves as citizens.
“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof (italics mine), are citizens of the United States,” reads the Fourteenth Amendment’s citizenship clause.
Presently, it’s as if the Courts, politicians and the punditry who support birthright citizenship elide completely any mention of jurisdiction as if it were to only say “all persons born or naturalized in the United States … are citizens of the United States.”
But there’s one glaring problem: it does not.
The author of the clause — Michigan Sen. Jacob Howard — made clear in the halls of Congress the clause’s intent. He explains that “jurisdiction thereof” was meant to exclude “persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to families of ambassadors or foreign ministers,” and that “jurisdiction” meant “full and complete jurisdiction.”
This was as understood both by Congress and the people as Howard’s speeches were disseminated to the public at the time.
No one is disputing that anyone on American soil is not subject to territorial jurisdiction, and required to follow American law. But it doesn’t follow that one is also afforded political jurisdiction. If, for example, an illegal alien were afforded the latter he would be able to vote, serve on jury and could not be deported, he could self-immigrate and be afforded complete sovereignty akin to that of a citizen.
Only when an alien becomes an American citizen, repeating the oath of allegiance to the United States that is part of our naturalization process, are they granted political jurisdiction. This is the moment when jurisdiction becomes full and complete.
As late 19th-century scholar and Judge Thomas Cooley writes in his treatise The General Principles of Constitutional Law in America:
[A] citizen by birth must not only be born within the United States, but he must also be subject to the jurisdiction thereof; and by this is meant that full and complete jurisdiction to which citizens generally are subject, and not any qualified and partial jurisdiction, such as may consist with allegiance to some other government.
“This amendment which I have offered is simply declaratory of what I regard as the law of the land already,” Howard said in his remarks introducing the new language before the Senate in 1866. The law he was referring to was the Civil Rights Act of 1866, passed less than two months prior over a veto from then-President Andrew Johnson by a two-thirds majority in both houses.
“[T]hat all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States,” read the citizenship provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.
Considering the political climate immediately following the Civil War, there were legitimate concerns the Act may be in jeopardy, so “the Congress took steps to include similar language when it considered the draft of the Fourteenth Amendment,” according to the Library of Congress.
In 1873, five years after the Fourteenth Amendment’s passage, U.S. Attorney General George Williams, in a legal opinion, explained that the term “jurisdiction” meant “absolute and complete jurisdiction” excluding aliens, even those born on American soil. The clause also excluded Native Americans (who the majority of, at the time, had little desire to be American citizens).
Howard assured his colleagues this language would not confer citizenship on Native Americans, who were born within the Country’s geographical limits, because they owe allegiance to their tribes.
To Lyman Trumbull, chairman of senate judiciary committee, subject to the “jurisdiction thereof,” meant “not owing allegiance to anybody else and being subject to the complete jurisdiction of the United States.”
The desideratum of “absolute” jurisdiction excludes any children who might owe allegiance to another sovereign, such as children that are subjects of any foreign government as explained in Elk v. Wilkins in 1884.
Foreign citizens cannot bestow jurisdiction on their children merely by giving birth within the geographic boundaries of the United States, only with the consent of the sovereign people can they be conferred jurisdiction.
It wasn’t until 1898 in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, that the “separate but equal” court, held that any child born in the U.S. of legal immigrant parents with “permanent” residence in the United States are guaranteed citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment. A narrow exception would be for children of diplomats.
There is zero precedent for allowing citizenship to children born to illegal alien parents. Article 1, section 8, clause 4 gives plenary power to Congress over naturalization and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment over jurisdiction, which Congress altered to allow Indians born in the US to become citizens in 1924.
There is no existing law passed by Congress as of now that gives jurisdiction to illegal aliens born in the United States.
The executive and judiciary don’t have the power to decide the issue.
The debate over whether Trump can sign an executive order to end the practice of birthright citizenship is a different argument entirely.",1
708,"A coalition of 16 states led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a brief at the Supreme Court Tuesday, urging the justices to reinstate key provisions of President Donald Trump’s executive order on refugees and migrants.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) asked the high court to let the president’s order take effect last Friday, after the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court injunction barring enforcement of its travel ban provision. DOJ asked the Court to stay the lower court orders and schedule the case for oral arguments. The Court asked challengers to the travel ban to file a response to the government’s petition by June 12.
“The executive order is a tailored response to a very real threat to our national security,” Paxton said in a statement. “A temporary pause on entry from countries with heightened security concerns is necessary to shore up our nation’s vetting procedures. The president is fulfilling his solemn duty to protect Texans and all Americans.”
The states make three arguments: that the order deserves the strongest presumption of validity under relevant precedent; that the challengers cannot show the actual purpose of the order is to establish a discriminatory policy; and that the lower court injunction impermissibly extends constitutional rights to aliens abroad.
“This injunction is contrary to law, and it denies the federal government — under a statutory regime crafted by the representatives from the States in Congress — the latitude necessary to make national-security, foreign-affairs, and immigration policy judgments inherent in this country’s nature as a sovereign,” the brief reads.
Texas is joined on the amicus (or “friend-of-the-court”) brief by Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant.
Several other states, including Hawaii and Washington have been involved in litigation challenging the order.",1
1290,"Mexico’s apprehensions and deportations of Central American migrants trying to reach the U.S. remained high in July, but fell from the previous month as a policy reversal that cracked down on irregular migration deters attempts to cross Mexico’s southern border with Guatemala, Mexican officials said. Mexican authorities detained 18,758 migrants in July, more than double the number apprehended in the year-earlier month, according to preliminary data on Sunday from Mexico’s immigration agency. The figure is below the record 31,573 apprehensions reported for June, primarily because of an about-40% drop in migrant flows through Mexico to the U.S. from May to July, officials said. Mexico deported 18,168 migrants in July, fewer than in June but more than triple the deportations in December, when President Andrés Manuel López Obrador took office. On June 7, Mexico agreed to step up law enforcement against irregular migration to avoid import tariffs on Mexican goods the Trump administration threatened to impose unless Mexico did more to curb the number of migrants crossing its territory. To the surprise of migration activists, President Trump has found in his leftist nationalist counterpart an unlikely ally in stemming the flow of Central American asylum seekers heading to the U.S. At first, Mr. López Obrador opened Mexico’s doors to Central American migrants, offering them humanitarian visas and jobs, a move that resulted in a surge of migrants heading to the U.S.-Mexico border. In a March speech, he said: “My government is not in favor of the use of force to contain migration.” But after the agreement reached with the U.S. in June, his government deployed along Mexico’s northern and southern borders more than 20,000 members of the newly created National Guard, formed by members of the military and federal police. As the migrant crisis on the U.S. border with Mexico intensifies, government agency leaders have been invited to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Here's a look at the conditions drawing scrutiny and the answers lawmakers will be seeking. Photo: AFP
Mexico’s stepped-up migration enforcement marks a departure from Mr. López Obrador’s views when he was campaigning to become president. ""He said he would be an advocate of Mexico’s dignity and sovereignty, and what we have seen is a López Obrador at the service of Trump,” said Jesús Silva-Herzog, a political analyst at the Tecnológico de Monterrey university. “Mexico didn’t pay for the wall, but became Trump’s wall.” In early 2017, Mr. López Obrador filed a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights against Mr. Trump’s plans to build a wall along the length of the U.S.-Mexico border and several executive orders on migration that Mr. Trump issued shortly after his inauguration. Mr. López Obrador said at the time that Mr. Trump’s “policy of hate” was discriminatory and violated migrants’ human rights, and that then Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto was “obedient, silent in the face of Donald Trump’s arrogance.” He later described Mr. Trump’s immigration rhetoric as xenophobic and neofascist. Mr. López Obrador’s relations with Mr. Trump improved after the 2018 election, when the Mexican leader began speaking of a mutually respectful relationship. Mr. López Obrador’s shift on migration is popular among most Mexicans. A recent poll by the Reforma newspaper showed 55% of Mexicans are in favor of deporting illegal immigrants, and most also agree they are a burden on Mexico. Mr. López Obrador’s approval ratings remain high at 61%, according to pollster Consulta Mitofsky. But his new approach disappointed human-rights activists. ""We never thought a leftist president would unleash this unprecedented hunt. He went as far as arresting social activists,” said Gina Garibo, an activist with migration advocacy group People Without Borders. In June, Mexican authorities detained two prominent pro-migrant activists on charges of human smuggling. A judge later dismissed the charges and they were released. Many migrants have postponed trips north because the risk of being detained in Mexico is now high, said Jeremías Estrada, a resident of Ciudad Hidalgo, a Mexican town bordering with Guatemala, who collaborates with pro-migrant groups. “This is not a good time to go north,” he said. A Mexican government official said the presence of the National Guard has dissuaded some migration. In recent weeks, immigration officers and National Guard members have raided guest houses and hotels in the southern border city of Tapachula in search of illegal migrants, according to a report released by the Crossborder Migration and Gender Working Group, which includes more than 20 charities and volunteer organizations assisting migrants. Migrants are being detained at checkpoints staffed by immigration officers, federal police and National Guard members along the southern border. They are being transferred to overcrowded detention centers in towns like Tapachula, Comitán and San Cristóbal, the group said.",0
821,"OutletName called one of President Donald Trump’s Facebook posts concerning Muslims racist, implying the religion of Islam is actually a race.
TheNYT asserted Muslims are a race in an article entitled Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook’s Leaders Fought Through Crisis, concerning Facebook’s potential to spread racist ideals, among other things. The author highlighted a Facebook post from Trump calling for a “‘total and complete shutdown’ on Muslims entering the United States” as an example of said racism. “Then Donald J. Trump ran for president. He described Muslim immigrants and refugees as a danger to America, and in December 2015 posted a statement on Facebook calling for a ‘total and complete shutdown’ on Muslims entering the United States. Mr. Trump’s call to arms — widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans — was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the site’s power to spread racist sentiment,” the piece reads.
The page linked in the Facebook post from Trump has since been taken down. Regardless, TheNYT’s take on the post is inaccurate at best, as Muslims are simply followers of the religion of Islam and represent many different races and ethnicities around the world. At worst, its take could be interpreted as TheNYT implying that Muslims only come from a particular race of people.",1
1298,"Across most of the southern U.S. border, hundreds of immigrant families are being ushered out of the country every day as part of the Trump administration program known as “Remain in Mexico.” But in Arizona, many families are finding the policy is still “remain in the U.S.” Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan pronounced in September that virtually all asylum-seeking families would be either quickly deported or sent to Mexico to wait for their cases to be resolved. Authorities and advocates confirmed, however, that in Arizona many hundreds of such people each week are instead being released to shelters, from which they will likely travel to other states and wait for their cases to be resolved, a process that can take years. Shelters in Arizona say the number of migrants being dropped off by border authorities has been roughly constant for the past few months, while shelter operators in other Southwestern states say the number has fallen significantly. Now some migrants are heading to Arizona as word spreads that they are far more likely to be allowed to stay in the U.S. there than if they cross in Texas, New Mexico, or California. “We heard it was easier here,” said Orlando, who left Cuba with his 21-year-old son Oscar six months ago and initially made his way to Ciudad Juárez, the Mexican city across the border from El Paso. After months of waiting for their chance to cross and request asylum, a Venezuelan migrant the pair met recommended they head to Nogales, just across the border from Arizona, because the program officially known as Migrant Protection Protocol isn’t in effect there. Orlando and Oscar spoke on the condition that they only be identified by their first names. Some migrants seeking asylum do so after legal border crossings. Those traveling as families often cross illegally and, under previous policies, were often allowed to wait in the U.S. for their cases to be decided. Customs and Border Protection, which includes the Border Patrol, confirmed that MPP isn’t in place in Arizona, but said some migrants arrested there are being shuttled to Texas or California and returned to Mexico from there. The agency didn’t respond to questions about why the program isn’t in place in Arizona and how it fit with a statement by acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan last month that, “we have essentially ended catch and release at the southwest border.” Teresa Cavendish, who runs the Casa Alitas shelter in Tucson, said federal authorities have told her that the logistics of returning migrants to Mexico are more difficult in Arizona. Nogales, one of the state’s main crossings, is more than an hour’s drive from the nearest immigration court in Tucson, where migrants would be brought from Mexico for hearings, and is in a cramped area with little room to build holding facilities. Yuma, another of the state’s busy crossings, is three hours away from Tucson or Phoenix, which also has an immigration court. More than 55,000 migrants, mostly from Central America, have been sent back to Mexico since the administration launched the program in late January. A CBP spokeswoman didn’t respond to requests for comment about how many of them initially crossed in Arizona. Administration officials have said the turn-back program would ease crowding in congested Border Patrol stations and deter families for whom the ability to await their cases in the U.S. was a draw. They also said it would allow asylum seekers to have their cases heard in weeks or months instead of years. The expansion of MPP this year, along with greater cooperation from Mexico in blocking migrants from reaching the border, has contributed to dramatic decreases in arrests along the border from a peak of more than 132,000 in May to 36,300 in September, according to administration officials and numbers reviewed by OutletName. As the migrant crisis on the U.S. border with Mexico intensifies, government agency leaders have been invited to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Here's a look at the conditions drawing scrutiny and the answers lawmakers will be seeking. Photo: AFP
Immigration advocates and lawyers have argued that MPP violates migrants’ due process rights and all but ensures that they will face deportation. Several civil and immigrant rights groups have sued to block the program. A federal appeals court in California has allowed the program to continue while the case is litigated. Katie Sharar, who works with the aid group Kino Border Initiative, said word is spreading on social media and informal information networks that migrants who cross into Arizona aren’t being returned to Nogales. Nelson Casique, a Venezuelan migrant, flew to Mexico from Colombia and started his wait to cross the border in Reynosa, across the Rio Grande from McAllen, Texas. He left after his nephew crossed into the U.S. there a few months ago and was sent back to Mexico with a court date for November. He is hoping he will have better luck by crossing into Arizona. “Friends told me that in Nogales they aren’t returning people,” he said.",0
1414,"President Trump said Thursday the U.S. would impose escalating tariffs on all Mexican imports beginning June 10, in an effort to push the country to deter the flow of asylum-seeking Central American families to the southern border. Reacting to what he described as “Mexico’s passive cooperation in allowing this mass incursion,” the president said the tariff on America’s third-largest trading partner would begin at 5% and grow steadily, hitting 25% on Oct. 1 unless Mexico takes satisfactory action to halt the migrants. “If the illegal migration crisis is alleviated through effective actions taken by Mexico, to be determined in our sole discretion and judgment, the Tariffs will be removed,” Mr. Trump said in a statement released by the White House. The president also lashed out at Democrats, who he said “refuse to help in any way, shape, or form.” Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador responded with a letter addressed to Mr. Trump in which he called for deeper dialogue on the migration issue. “Social problems are not resolved with taxes or coercive measures,” he said. He reiterated his proposal to confront migration through development efforts in Central America, adding that Mexico is doing what it can to curb the flow of migrants across Mexico without violating human rights. “People don’t leave their homelands for pleasure but out of necessity,” Mr. López Obrador said. “I don’t lack courage, I’m not a coward or timid, but act out of principles. I believe in politics which, among other things, was invented to avoid confrontation and war.” He asked Mr. Trump to make U.S. officials available to meet with Mexican officials, led by Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who will travel to Washington on Friday. Mr. Trump’s disclosure had an immediate impact on stock trading in Tokyo, pressuring shares in car makers with significant investments in supply chains that span the U.S.-Mexico border. In currency markets, Mexico’s peso slumped against the dollar, falling almost 2% in a few minutes. The trade action also complicates Mr. Trump’s effort to win congressional ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal intended to supersede the North American Free Trade Agreement. “This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “I support nearly every one of President Trump’s immigration policies, but this is not one of them.” Mazda Motor Corp., which assembles passenger cars in Mexico for the U.S. market, was down as much as 7% in midmorning trading in Asia on Friday before rebounding from those lows. Honda Motor Co. was down 3.2%, Toyota Motor Corp. fell 2% and Nissan Motor Co. slid 3.6%. “It’s very bad news for them,” says Toshiyuki Suzuki, market economist at MUFG Bank, referring to Japanese car makers. Business groups voiced alarm at the tariff plans, which they say could harm current and future trade agreements between the two countries and lead to retaliation against U.S. farm products and manufactured goods in the North American supply chain. In addition to autos and auto parts, the U.S. imports a variety of consumer goods from Mexico, such as appliances, and agricultural products like fruits and vegetables. “You can’t use trade as a weapon in areas like immigration and not think that you’re completely and totally violating the commitments you just made to another country on trade,” said Rufus Yerxa, president of the National Foreign Trade Council. “This is going to be devastating for the auto sector.” It wasn’t immediately clear if the tariff warning was a short-term effort to make gains in an area important to Mr. Trump or part of a longer-term plan to ratchet up security and economic tensions as the 2020 election season approaches. Mr. Trump in 2016 repeatedly threatened to pull the U.S. out of Nafta, only to negotiate a successor to the 1994 pact. The administration has acted decisively on some tariffs plans—including steel and aluminum duties—while others such as auto tariffs have been delayed and are often seen as a negotiating tactic. Democratic lawmakers, who weren’t consulted ahead of time, criticized the plan. “The President is unilaterally imposing the equivalent of a 17 billion dollar sales tax which sounds not very free market-y to me,” wrote Sen. Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) on Twitter. The tariffs would likely take an economic toll in both countries. The U.S. imported $346.5 billion of Mexican goods in 2018, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. U.S. importers would pay more for Mexican products due to the tariffs, essentially a tax at the border, and likely pass a significant portion of the price hike on to consumers. Meanwhile, Mexican exporters, many linked to U.S. or international investors, in turn would come under pressure to lower prices or face a loss of customers to competing manufacturing economies world-wide. The U.S. agricultural sector over the past year has endured lower crop prices and commodity-market swings driven by trade disputes. Farmers have been counting on the USMCA trade deal bringing stability, said a spokesman for the American Farm Bureau Federation. “New tariffs would only serve to cloud that trade horizon,” he said. In the past the Trump administration has blurred the line between economic and national-security concerns, including when it put tariffs on Mexican steel and aluminum. Cold War-era security laws give him broad powers to regulate trade without a vote in Congress. The Trump administration has repeatedly blamed Mexico for not doing enough to stop Central Americans from crossing through that country en route to the U.S. However, Mexico has allowed the U.S. to return thousands of asylum-seeking migrants to Mexico to await U.S. immigration court hearings, and officials there have made efforts to detain and deport some Central Americans traveling through the country. Between January 2018 and August 2018, Mexico deported more Central Americans than the U.S., according to the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations agency. On Thursday, hours ahead of Mr. Trump’s announcement, Customs and Border Protection officials said they had encountered a group of more than 1,000 migrants at the border. Large groups of people, traveling with children and seeking to turn themselves in to gain asylum, pose particular logistical and security challenges for Border Patrol agents. Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan said there were three specific actions the administration wanted to see Mexico take: stepping up its security efforts at the southern border with Guatemala to impede the northern flow of migrants, cracking down on smuggling organizations and aligning some of its asylum rules with U.S. demands. The tariff threat comes at an awkward time, since the Trump administration is working to secure ratification of USMCA in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. All three countries took steps to ratify USMCA this week. The Trump administration on Thursday submitted to Congress a document known as the draft statement of administrative intent that prepares the way for legislation that would implement the deal, and Mexico’s Senate is also reviewing the deal for ratification. Democrats in Congress are seeking changes and could block ratification. The tariffs could deal a blow to Mexico’s vital export industry. Mexican exports, the vast majority of which go to the U.S., account for about 37% of Mexico’s overall economy. Mexico’s economy already contracted 0.2% in the first three months of the year. The leftist policies of Mr. López Obrador, who took office in December, have cast a chill on investment, and trade uncertainty could hit investment further, tipping the economy into recession. “If Mexico’s economy falls into recession, it will have fewer resources and ability to stop Central Americans or indeed its own people going north,” said Shannon O’Neil, a senior fellow for Latin America at the Council on Foreign Relations. Many investors and companies that have operations in Mexico had assumed that USMCA would likely spare Mexico and Canada from the type of trade frictions the U.S. is currently having with China. But this move will create a new level of uncertainty, said Ms. O’Neil.",0
1430,"For 17 years, Cesar has risen at 4 a.m. to work in a barn behind the Churchill Downs racetrack, tending to the prize thoroughbreds assigned to him: icing and wrapping their legs, washing them down after practice runs, raking their stalls. Like scores of other so-called backstretch workers preparing for next month’s Kentucky Derby, Cesar—one of his given names—is in the U.S. illegally. He lives on the racetrack grounds but is increasingly unwilling to set foot outside the gates, afraid he will be arrested and sent back to Guatemala. “Because of Trump,” Cesar said. “I have a car, I bought it for $3,000, but I don’t want to drive it.” Kentucky is Trump country, with more than 62% of voters in the state siding with the Republican candidate. His message of toughened immigration enforcement, for both security and economic reasons, resonated here. But Kentucky is also horse country, and many in the state’s most glamorous business say the president’s immigration crackdown is causing a pinch. Trainers say they depend on a steady supply of foreign labor, primarily from Latin America and Mexico, to do jobs Americans won’t. At Churchill Downs, backstretch workers are part of an ecosystem that for decades has operated on a “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy. No one at the track could recall a raid or any other enforcement action related to immigration on the grounds themselves, but all agreed the threat is increasingly acute as they prepare for the sport’s marquee race. Trainers say they would prefer to hire legally, but faced with a deficit of American applicants or legal visa-holders, they have no choice but to accept people willing to work jobs that require long hours and pay between $10 and $15 an hour. “We’d be out of business if we didn’t have them,” one trainer said. At racetracks around the country, many of the grooms, exercise riders and stablehands have green cards or full citizenship, but a greater number are in the country illegally, according to immigration lawyers and trainers. Other workers come and go each year on temporary visas, which some trainers say they depend on for a legal, steady workforce. “We’ve made it so difficult for us to get a labor force that’s necessary,” said Dale Romans, one of racing’s most successful trainers, with almost $100 million in winnings over a 30-year career. One of his horses, J Boys Echo, is slated to run in the Derby on May 6. “If they start rounding up people, they are going to realize how important” the immigrant workforce is to the industry, Romans said. A number of his workers left the country in mid-April when their visas expired. “We’re really rolling the dice that we get them back,” Romans said. Meanwhile, some say immigration enforcement has toughened, even against people who don’t have criminal backgrounds. Will Velie, an immigration lawyer in Norman, Okla. who has many trainers as clients, said more workers are being stopped by police for traffic violations and other suspected offenses, then detained and deported if they lacked proper paperwork. “No small offense is going unpunished,” Velie said. Twice a year, the Department of Labor issues 33,000 H-2B visas to employers for seasonal “unskilled” workers, in industries from landscaping to seafood preparation. (President Trump’s businesses have used H-2B visas: earlier this year, the Trump National Golf Club outside New York City filed paperwork seeking eight H-2B visas for food services this summer, paying $14.08 an hour.) In 2015, 1,513 positions for “nonfarm animal caretakers,” which include backstretch workers, were certified nationally by the Department of Labor. Until last fall, returning workers who had already received H-2Bs didn’t count against the annual 66,000 cap and had more flexible start dates. That exemption expired on Sept. 30 and hasn’t been extended, leaving trainers rushing to file their applications for their spring and summer workforce to avoid getting shut out of the contracting supply of visas. “The reality of our visa system is that it is woefully insufficient to meet the needs of companies,” said Jeremy Robbins, executive director of the New American Economy, an advocacy group that promotes the role of immigrants in the American workforce. While many in the racing industry describe the H-2B program as cumbersome and expensive, they are still pushing to have the exemption reinstated, arguing that the program supports tens of thousands of other jobs. “All of those jobs are in danger, if you don’t have somebody to take care of the horses,” said Ben Pendergrass, senior vice president of policy and legislative affairs at the American Horse Council, a lobbying group. “Without the H-2B visa program, I’m shutting down my business,” said Niall Brennan, a horse trainer in Ocala, Fla. whose stables helped train 2016 Kentucky Derby winner Nyquist. Brennan applied for and was granted 35 visas to last through the end of the summer, but he’s not sure what will happen in the fall once that group leaves. Like Romans, Brennan said he would like to see a pathway to citizenship for his workers, many of whom have returned year after year. “They are great employees,” Brennan said. “They pay taxes, they are vital to the local economy.” One foreman at Churchill Downs came to the U.S. from Mexico 18 years ago on an H-2B visa. Eight years ago, he said, he applied for residency—he said he was approved, but never received his papers. He has been without a visa for five years, and hopes that his U.S.-born children will one day be able to sponsor him for legal residency. “The visa is very important, to live without fear of anything,” said the foreman. He said workers won’t leave, as visas often require, without a guarantee that they can return. “Nobody knows if it will be more difficult.” Cesar has returned to Guatemala just once in 17 years, and stays in touch with his children over the phone. On his afternoon shifts, Cesar keeps his phone at his side, softly playing Guatemalan news and sports radio. At Churchill Downs, some people are “in flight from the police,” Cesar said. At home in Guatemala, it’s the gangs. “I tell my sons, ‘Don’t go into them, because you will never come out.’”",0
172,"A proposed law that would punish countries that refuse to take back their illegal immigrant criminals is two years too late to save Casey Chadwick, but the Texas congressman behind it figures it’s the least Washington can do.
Chadwick was murdered in 2015 by Jean Jacques, an illegal immigrant from Haiti and one of thousands freed onto U.S. streets each year after they serve prison time because their homelands refuse deportation. But a proposal by Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, the Criminal Alien Deportation Enforcement Act, would force such countries to take back their citizens or risk losing foreign aid and travel visa privileges.
“The problem is hundreds of Americans are being robbed, assaulted, raped or murdered every year by criminal aliens who are then released back onto the streets because their countries of origins refuse to take them back,” Babin said. “I have personally met with a number of these victims, or if the victim is deceased, I have met with their families. It is heart-wrenching.”
Chadwick’s case is among the most egregious, Babin said. Jacques was sentenced to 60 years in prison last year for stabbing Chadwick, 25, to death in her Norwich apartment. The killer had been in the U.S. illegally since 1992, had already spent 17 years in prison for attempted murder and possession of a firearm without a permit.
He was not deported after serving time, but it was not for lack of U.S. effort. Jacques was listed as a passenger on three charter flights to Haiti in June, August and October of 2012, but each time the Haitian government refused to repatriate him.
A 2001 Supreme Court ruling, Zadvydas v. Davis, held that illegal immigrants ticketed for deportation but unaccepted by their home countries cannot be detained indefinitely. Jacques was held for 205 days, but ultimately freed less than six months before he killed Chadwick.
“For the sake of Casey and thousands of other Americans who have been victimized, it is time we start putting the safety of our citizens first and stop this revolving door that is allowing dangerous criminals who should be deported back onto our streets,” Babin said.
A House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing in April documented that since 2013, 86,288 illegal immigrants have committed 231,074 crimes after being released from prison. Many of those illegal immigrants are ultimately deported, but some 2,166 who had served their time for various crimes were released last year when their home countries refused to take them back.
Babin’s bill would require the Department of Homeland Security report to Congress every three months the names of uncooperative countries. The federal government would then withhold foreign aid to those countries while the State Department would suspend travel visas.
Under President-elect Donald Trump, the bill faces “renewed interest” because Trump “has voiced his strong support for punishing countries that refuse to accept deportations,” Babin said.
The problem is “getting out of hand,” agreed Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies.
There are now more than 20 countries that refuse to cooperate with the U.S., and more than 60 that make the process extremely difficult, Vaughan said.
“It’s not just Cuba and Cambodia anymore; now it’s China, Bangladesh, Nigeria and many others,” she said.
The State Department has imposed visa sanctions only once, on Gambia, just a few months ago, which worked right away, Vaughan said.
“All they had to do was stop issuing visas to Gambian government officials, and they suddenly started cooperating, within weeks, which is fast in the diplomatic context,” Vaughan said.
Under current law, the State Department must impose sanctions upon request of the Department of Homeland Security, but that rarely happens, said Vaughan.
Claude Arnold, a former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations, said in past administrations, DHS would raise this issue to the State Department but nothing would ever happen. He believes under this proposed bill, will be more Congressional oversight.
“The U.S. is the center of international trade. As soon as businesses are not allowed to come to the U.S. to do business internationally, that’s all it would take,” Arnold said. “Those countries would start accepting back their deportees immediately because they would get such pressure from their citizenry who would be hurt financially.”
Neither the State Department nor the Department of Homeland Security comments on pending legislation.
But a State Department official told OutletNameNews.com facilitating the removal of aliens subject to a final order of removal, particularly those who pose a danger to national security or public safety, is a “top priority.”
“Stepped-up diplomatic efforts by [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and the State Department have resulted in significant increases in cooperation among the 23 countries currently on ICE’s Uncooperative list, with nearly half of these countries improving their records of issuing travel documents, accepting charter deportee flights with deportees, and agreeing on formal arrangements for future removals in recent months,” the spokesman said.
A spokesperson for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement said the agency is working through “diplomatic channels” to ensure that other countries accept the timely return of their nationals in accordance with international law.
But Babin said he will fight for tougher restrictions.
“Many of these countries are getting millions and millions of dollars from the American taxpayer, and then not taking their criminals back,” Babin said.

800,"West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin is bucking the Democratic Party, announcing that he will vote for legislation funding a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
“Today I will vote for both gov funding bills b/c I believe we must end this harmful shutdown immediately & it’s our first opportunity in the Senate to do so,” the Democrat tweeted Thursday. “Even though they will probably fail, these votes are a start to finding a way to reopen the gov & get WVians back to work.”
Today I will vote for both gov funding bills b/c I believe we must end this harmful shutdown immediately & it’s our first opportunity in the Senate to do so. Even though they will probably fail, these votes are a start to finding a way to reopen the gov & get WVians back to work — Senator Joe Manchin (_JoeManchin) January 24, 2019
The Senate will vote on two sharply different funding bills Thursday. First, lawmakers will vote on a GOP-backed bill that includes $5.7 billion the president has requested to fund his border wall and protections for some migrants. Following that vote, lawmakers will then decide on a Democratic-led budget proposal that does not include funding for the wall.
Both bills are expected to fail.
Despite Republicans holding a 53-seat majority, Senate rules require at least 60 votes for budget bills, and Democrats have remained steadfast in their opposition to the border wall. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have agreed to allow both bills to receive a floor vote in hopes that it will be a step toward a compromise.
Manchin is not the only lawmaker who will vote in favor of both bills. Republican Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine indicated they plan to vote for both bills, stressing the necessity to open the government and let federal employees finally receive a paycheck.
Thursday marked the 34th day since the federal government entered a partial government shutdown. While some lawmakers in both the Senate and House have floated compromises, both parties have remained deadlocked on funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Democrats maintain they want to fund the government before border security negations can continue. Trump on Saturday extended an olive branch to Democrats, offering Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) protections for “Dreamers” and extended legal status for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders in exchange for a wall, but that offer was flatly rejected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.",1
425,"Press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters in Wednesday’s briefing that the White House will release an immigration deal bill framework on Monday.
“Last fall the White House sent Congress a list of the core reforms necessary to fix our immigration system,” said Sanders. The list was compiled in considering talks on the issue with frontline law enforcement officers and career public servants.
Sanders pointed to dozens of meetings since that list was sent – meetings to discuss the reforms and find a “bipartisan path forward” with Republican and Democrat leadership and rank and file members of the House and Senate. Those negotiations are the basis of a new legislative framework that the White House has assembled and will release on Monday.
This framework “represents a compromise that members of both parties can support,” said Sanders, adding they will encourage the Senate to bring it to the floor. “This framework will fulfill the four agreed upon pillars: securing the border and closing legal loopholes, ending extended family chain migration, canceling the visa lottery, and providing a permanent solution on DACA.”
President Donald Trump himself has been repeatedly emphatic that any deal on DACA recipients must include an end to the visa lottery, end to chain migration, and funding for border security including his signature campaign promise for a southern border wall.

458,"The U.S. government’s failure to establish border security is a moral failure and support for illegal immigration is “cruel,” President Donald Trump declared in his second State of the Union as the nearby Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, refused to clap.
The President’s focus on morality contrasts with the Democrats’ determination to persuade Americans that immigration curbs are merely forms of shameful racial discrimination. Trump built his moral case for border security and a border wall by first highlighting the criminal role of the drug and labor trafficking cartels:
Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business …
This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our Southern Border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws … Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.
This emphasis on morality shifts the focus from the poor migrants who try to get jobs in U.S workplaces towards the U.S. politicians who quietly endorse the mass migration.
Trump next spotlighted the Democrats’ support for easy-migration policies which transfer wages and opportunities from working-class Americans to older, wealthier investors:
No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded that you can’t get in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not clap as Trump slammed the immorality of her party’s welcome of migrants.
Trump pushed his moral argument even more by tacitly charging Democrats with cruelty for welcoming illegal migration:
Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery. Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our Southern Border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they’re going to keep streaming back in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads and families — no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.
Trump then introduced three Americans whose elderly relatives were allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant:
Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter Madison. To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.
Trump also spotlighted an immigrant Hispanic border security officer to undermine the Democrats’ attempt to portray border security as a racist campaign:
We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: “If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve done my job.” Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.
Then Trump made his case for the border wall:
My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our Southern Border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.
Trump rarely departed from the text of his speech. For example, he added the boldfaced text to this passage: “I want people to come into our country, in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.”
The establishment’s economic policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.
That annual flood of roughly one million legal immigrants — as well as visa workers and illegal immigrants — spikes profits and Wall Street values by shrinking salaries for 150 million blue-collar and white-collar employees and especially wages for the four million young Americans who join the labor force each year.
The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that coastal investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices and pushes poor U.S. Americans, including Latinos and blacks, out of prosperous cities such as Berkeley and Oakland, California.",1
1355,"Manuela Hernández began receiving death threats a couple of months ago on notes demanding she pay a “war tax” to the violent street gangs that control her neighborhood. Unable to give them $50 a month, the 36-year-old single mother said she feels like she has just one option: flee to the U.S. with her 5-year-old daughter. “I have to go because if not,” she said, and paused to draw a finger across her throat. “You can’t have a life with the gangs.” President Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants hasn’t deterred people like Ms. Hernández from trying to reach the U.S., highlighting the severe living conditions for many people in Central America’s Northern Triangle, which includes Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Violence and a lack of economic opportunities drive people to flee, according to migrants and activists, as unemployed youth are recruited into the rival MS-13 and Barrio 18 gangs that are involved in drug trafficking, extortion, kidnapping and murder. Criminal violence scares businesses away, further hurting job opportunities. Hondurans continue to risk their lives on the journey, traveling by bus, by cargo train or on foot in the hope of escaping the poverty and violence ravaging the country. Most days, planes arrive in San Pedro Sula carrying migrants deported from the U.S. “The migrants who are coming regardless of what is happening in the U.S. are those who can’t afford to wait,” said Maureen Meyer, an immigration expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human-rights advocacy organization. “You have asylum seekers saying I’d rather be in jail in the U.S. than killed in my own country.” Immigration experts say people will continue trying to enter the U.S. unless there are policies that create economic opportunities and reduce crime. That will require cracking down on rampant corruption and strengthening the rule of law, policies that have been launched in Honduras as the government looks to expel corrupt police officers. Some organizations are trying to provide young people opportunities to stop migration from Honduras, where about two-thirds of the country’s nine million people live in poverty, according to the World Bank. On a recent weekend, young men and women who have been deported from the U.S. and Mexico were learning job skills in a program in San Pedro Sula run by the Mennonite Social Action Commission. Johanna Bonilla, a 24-year-old in the program, recalled going hungry in the Mexican desert and being detained for two months after crossing into the U.S. a few years ago. “It was a terrifying experience,” she said. Central Americans are increasingly the face of undocumented immigration at the southern border of the U.S. Immigration from Mexico has fallen sharply in recent years, mostly due to slower population growth. Asylum petitions from the Northern Triangle have significantly risen since 2010, according to U.S. figures. The region has a long history of political strife, from bloody civil wars to last year’s contested presidential election in Honduras that sparked social unrest and led to the deaths of two dozen people. Today, about 95% of homicides in the Northern Triangle countries go unpunished, creating a deep distrust of police, according to the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, a think tank at the Atlantic Council. Erasmus Salinas, a 64-year-old who sells beans on a street corner in San Pedro Sula, said he doubts police will ever find the killer of his brother-in-law, who he said was murdered two years ago. “There is no justice,” said Mr. Salinas. In El Salvador, Carlos Arguetta, said he used to make $1,000 a month carrying out robberies and extortion as a former gang member. Now, Mr. Arguetta, a born-again Christian, said he earns less than half that as a security guard at a garment factory. “One of the main reasons the gangs are so strong is unemployment,” he said. “If someone offers you $25 to sell some drugs or do an errand, a lot of times that’s the only open door you’ll find.” Iván Buezo said he is determined to make it back to the U.S. after recently being detained in Houston and deported. Days after being flown back to Honduras, the 17-year-old was waiting for a bus, ready for another attempt at migrating to the U.S., where he wants to find a job. In Honduras, he said he can earn just $5 a day working on a farm. “You can’t make any money here,” he said. “I want to go to work, to have a better future.”",0
2142,"President Trump presides over a meeting about immigration with Republican and Democrat members of Congress in the Cabinet Room at the White House Jan. 9, 2018 in Washington, D.C. During immigration talks in the Oval Office, President Trump reportedly grew frustrated, using a crude description of Haiti, El Salvador and African countries, according to a report from the Washington Post.
""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Trump reportedly told lawmakers on Thursday.
The president then suggested that the U.S. try to increase immigration from countries like Norway, whose prime minister he met with this week.
The Post's report was based on two sources who were briefed on the meeting. The meeting was attended by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Tom Cotton, R-Ark.,, as well as Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.
Per the Post, lawmakers were surprised by the president's comments.
This week the Trump administration announced that it was ending temporary legal protective status for 200,000 immigrants from El Salvador who have lived in the United States for nearly two decades. Last year, he removed protections from immigrants from Haiti. The temporary status was granted to immigrants from those two countries plus Nicaragua because of natural disasters that made their homes uninhabitable.
In response to the reported ""shithole countries"" comments, the White House did not deny that the president used the phrase.
""The president will only accept an immigration deal that adequately addresses the visa lottery system and chain migration -- two programs that hurt our country and allow terrorists into our country,"" White House spokesman Raj Shah said in a statement. ""Like other nations that have merit-based immigration, President Trump is fighting for permanent solutions that make our country stronger by welcoming those who can contribute to our society, grow our economy and assimilate into our great nation.""
The reported comments come as Trump and lawmakers are in negotiations over immigration reform. Trump has signaled he would sign a bill to protect 800,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the country as children, known as ""DREAMers, but only if it included funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Thursday that there is no deal yet, but ""we still think we can get there.""",0
1480,"Regarding Jason Willick’s “The Weekend Interview with David M. Kennedy: Does America Still Have a Common Creed?” (Nov. 30): David Kennedy wonders if the U.S. still has a common creed; diversity has become our new creed. I don’t think so, and I doubt that Mr. Kennedy means it quite that way. Immigrants don’t come to the U.S. to be different from all the rest of us. They come for the American dream: economic, political and religious rights and freedoms guaranteed by law, an equal chance to work for a higher standard of living, a better way of life, freedom to make their own choices and pursue their dreams, a life without fear, justice for all, no one above the law, tolerance of diversity, willingness to help others and many other elements of our common creed. Of course, we don’t all respect all of the elements all of the time, and we loudly debate our differences. Some Americans abuse and demonize other Americans and would-be Americans, but our occasional spurts of fear, hatred and nativism die out fairly quickly, and in the long run our common creed holds firm as we, together, regularly repeat the Pledge of Allegiance, sing the national anthem, celebrate our national holidays, honor our veterans, criticize our leaders and cast our votes. Native born or immigrant, it all eventually sinks into our souls—what it means to be an American. Don Peters Spokane, Wash.",0
652,"A multi-vehicle crash last week that claimed the life of the son of a Knoxville, Tennessee fire department captain was the result of a “chain reaction” begun by an illegal immigrant driving in the wrong lane, investigators said.
Pierce Kennedy Corcoran, 22, the son of Knoxville Fire Department spokesperson Captain D.J. Corcoran, was driving a Honda Civic south on Knoxville’s Chapman Highway the evening of December 30 when a Chevrolet pickup truck driven by Franco Cambrany Francisco-Eduardo reportedly veered into their lane and struck the vehicle.
Son of Knoxville Fire Captain dies in wreck, firefighters across the state come together to help
Corcoran was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel, and a passenger was treated but is expected to live. Both were wearing seat belts.
A Knoxville Police Department press release reported the accident to be the result of a “chain reaction crash” involving two other vehicles. No one was injured in the other vehicles involved.
44-year-old Franco Cambrany Francisco-Eduardo, an illegal immigrant, was arrested and charged with criminally negligent homicide as well as having no driver’s license or proof of financial responsibility, according to the News Sentinel, and was jailed without bond pending ICE action. Tennessee is not a sanctuary state.
The death of 22-year-old Pierce Corcoran has brought home to Knoxville the heated national debate over illegal immigration and the need for a border wall. 
On Friday, “Francisco-Eduardo was released from the Knox County Detention Facility into the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” the News Sentinel reported.
Tim Burchett, a newly-elected GOP representative who represents Tennessee’s 2nd congressional district, which covers Knoxville, called Corcoran’s death “tragic” and “entirely avoidable.”
“Based on the details released at this point, this situation underscores the need to fully enforce our existing immigration laws and strengthen and secure our border,” Burchett told the News Sentinel via email. “The bottom line is if the suspect hadn’t been in the country illegally, Pierce Corcoran would still be alive.”",1
64,"The heated immigration debate in Washington is shining a spotlight on a World War II-era agreement that allowed millions of Mexican immigrants to work in the U.S. as guest workers. The Bracero Program grew out of a series of bilateral agreements between Mexico and the United States that allowed Mexicans to come to the U.S. to work from 1942 through 1964 under short-term, agricultural labor contracts. “Bracero” loosely translates to “manual laborer.” The program was debated during a summit Friday and Saturday at the University of Texas at El Paso, hosted by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. “There were bosses that were stricter than others. Some treated braceros very harshly, others did not,” said Francisco Uvina, who was a bracero for seven years. Uvina described his time working on cotton fields to OutletName through a translator. “Braceros suffered a lot back then. Long nights. Picking while bent over. Hard work. Personally, I didn’t have a boss that treated me badly, but other braceros did. They would be taken advantage of,” said Uvina. The first men crossed the border 75 years ago this September. That’s when braceros started what they said was difficult but worthwhile work for farmers. One historian has said the braceros program was beneficial to many Americans -- but also started the pattern of bringing temporary workers into the U.S. and pushing them out when they’re done. Some braceros also became full-time residents and citizens of the U.S., starting families that are now multiple generations deep. The fate of other programs that currently allow migrants to stay in the U.S., like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, remains up in the air. “In these times when immigration is in the news and it’s so debated and so contested, I think the more that we in the United States know about immigration policy, the better we can actually make decisions,” said Yolinda Leyva, Director of the Institute of Oral History at UTEP. One of today’s closest equivalents to the bracero program would be the H-2A visa, which allows immigrants to work temporary or seasonal agricultural jobs. To qualify, employers must show there are not enough U.S. workers who are able to do the work. But the visa program has its critics. Such temporary work programs “just provide a way for employers to control very low paid work force,” said Leyva. “I think that’s a bad pattern to have. If we want workers we shouldn’t just think of them as temporary people.” In today’s society, a bracero-type program would play a very different role than it did 75 years ago. Machines have replaced many of the jobs braceros used to perform, so farmers need fewer hands for picking, but more skilled hands that are qualified to work machinery. “I probably wouldn’t need more than 10 to 15 max,” said Craige Miller, an owner of the Miller Farm. Miller said he might be interested in a similar program. “I’d have to see what all the requirements would be before I could say yay or nay on the deal.” Miller was a child when he said some 400 braceros worked on his farm. He remembers working alongside braceros, packing cotton into the back of trucks. Miller said they were a big help, back when they picked the cotton by hand. “Harvesting the crop would have been a real challenge without the bracero program,” said Miller. But now Miller picks his cotton with a machine that he says can do as much work in a day as 500 men. Coming to America gave many braceros their only opportunities to make a living, even if it wasn’t much. “In that time, in southern Mexico, there was no work. So we decided to come on board as braceros. They paid a little more money,” said Uvina. “There was more poverty in Mexico.” Uvina said he used to make 50 cents an hour as a bracero, but back then he could live on $5.00 a week. Uvina was brought into the United States through Rio Vista farm in Socorro, Texas. He said he worked on a cotton farm in Socorro for six years until he said he was fired for complaining about cold conditions. From there, Uvina said he went to a farm in California for six months, and then back to Fabens, Texas, for one more year. Now decades after he first arrived to work a temp job, Uvina is an American citizen along with his children and grandchildren.",1
2451,"The U.S. city of Albuquerque passed measures on Monday that make it harder for federal officials to deport illegal immigrants, a week after a federal judge blocked a Trump administration effort to withhold funding from cities that took such steps. Albuquerque’s majority-Democratic council voted 6-3 in favor of a measure to prevent federal immigration officials from entering city-operated areas, including a prisoner transport center, without a warrant. In a televised meeting, the council also barred city workers, including police, from collecting information on peoples’ immigration status and prohibited local tax dollars from being spent on federal immigration law enforcement. The measures were meant to bolster the “immigrant friendly” status of Albuquerque, the largest city in New Mexico where 47 percent of the population is Hispanic or Latino, the highest level for any U.S. state. U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has tried to crack down on mainly Democratic-run cities and states that he claims are “sanctuaries” for illegal immigrants. New Mexico is among the ten U.S. states with the highest percentages of illegal immigrants in their populations, according to Pew Research. A federal judge in Los Angeles last week issued a nationwide injunction to prevent the U.S. Department of Justice requiring police departments to help immigration officials in order to receive federal grants. The ruling marked an important win for local governments that have opposed Trump administration immigration policies and tried to keep out of federal immigration enforcement efforts.",0
802,"Niger Innis accused Symone Sanders of being an apologist for the anti-ICE movement on the left during their appearance on OutletName’s “Cuomo Prime Time” Friday night.
They were debating Kamala Harris’s statements about the perception of ICE, from Wednesday.
The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee was considering the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to be assistant Homeland Security secretary for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. During Harris’s questioning, she asked if Vitiello could see any parallels between ICE and the KKK.
“Let’s push past the hyperbole and get to the actual policy behind it. Do you believe that whether or not ICE should be abolished. Is that a legit question for Democrats to be asking in your opinion, Symone? Is that really something you guys should be considering?” Cuomo asked Sanders. Sanders responded, “You know, I think for Democrats that have come out on record that said they want ICE to be abolished, people should be asking those folks about abolishing ICE. But I think an overwhelming number of Democrats have come out and said we need to fix our broken immigration system, which would need to be a bipartisan effort, and when it comes to ICE perhaps we need to revisit it and there are currently many Democrats, myself including, that believe ICE is not currently operating inside its mission.”
“Are you open to that suggestion, Niger? That it’s not about abolishing, that the last thing we need is less people keeping the border safe but in terms of how they do their job, what their mandate is, and how it’s executed, is that something you would be open to reviewing?” Cuomo questioned Innis.
“I have strong libertarian instincts and any government entity needs proper oversight, supervision, and direction. But that is not what the extremists in the progressive movement are doing. They are demonizing the thousands of decent ICE officers that are trying to enforce our laws, including Senator Harris with her perception comparison of the Klan to ICE. So don’t run away from it, Symone. It was disgusting what she did,” Innis responded, mimicking Harris during his use of the word “perception.” “And she is spitting —I will say it again — Spitting on the memories of those who fought in the Civil War and the civil rights revolution against the Klan that terrorized black folk for over 100 years. Disgusting and Kamala Harris needs to apologize.”
“Look, Senator Harris is not apologizing for anything, I think we can be sure because she’d been very clear about what her position is,” Sanders added.
“Because she has apologists like you, Symone, defending her,” Innis retaliated.
Sanders asked, “Did you just call me an apologist?”
“I sure did,” Innis confirmed.
“I think you need a history lesson, sir,” Sanders responded.
Innis concluded, “Oh, please, give it to me, Symone, I want it.”",1
488,"Conservative Hispanic activist Anna Paulina told OutletName News that the Democrat Party reminds black Americans that slavery once existed in the country, yet the same politicians “turn a blind eye” when it comes to modern-day slavery of Latin Americans, enabled by unsecured borders.
“You have people like Nancy Pelosi, one of the most powerful women in politics rights now,” said Paulina to OutletName News in Los Angeles at Candace Owens’ first Blexit event, “saying that she cares about children — that she cares about Hispanics.”
“Yet [Pelosi] is ignoring the stats that the State Department put out, she’s ignoring the fact that there is literally slavery of women and children,” continued Paulina, “These children — they are trafficked, they are raped, they are killed, and [Democrats] turn a blind eye to it.”
Paulina also noted the hypocrisy perpetuated by Democrat politicians.
“They will remind black Americans every single day, that at one point, there was slavery,” said Paulina, “but when it comes to Hispanics, they turn a blind eye to [slavery], because, you know what, they only care about the vote.”
“They care about the fact that if they turn Hispanics into single-issues voters on immigration — that they’ll have their vote in 2020,” added the activist, “That’s why so many of us have come here [to Blexit] today, to say that we’re done with this — we don’t want anything to do with the Democratic Party.”
Paulina also mentioned that politicians have not formed any real resolutions on immigration, despite it being an issue for the past fifteen years.
“It’s not until now, that we’re seeing something potentially being done in the near future,” added the Hispanic activist, in reference to President Trump’s plan to secure the United States southern border.
“I hope to God that President Trump does that,” concluded Paulina, “because there’s a lot of innocent people that are being killed in the process.”

209,"A dozen people were arrested Monday after they attempted to enter the United States illegally from Mexico in a small makeshift boat that washed ashore in California, authorities said.
Firefighters examined those aboard after the panga boat – a type of small fishing vessel commonly used by smugglers – showed up off Huntington Beach about 2 p.m. Monday.
GROUP OF BORDER PATROL WIVES INVITE HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI TO VISIT TEXAS BORDER TOWN
Immigration officials told FOX11 a concerned citizen spotted the makeshift boat off the coast and called in the tip. When the boat made landfall, about 100 miles north of the U.S.-Mexican border, everyone on board ran for shelter.
Authorities said the men and women were cold but uninjured.
Nine Chinese men, a Chinese woman, and two Mexican men were handed over to federal custody. One of the Mexican men is believed to be the smuggler.
According to OutletNameLA, the boat first made entry via Anaheim Bay, which is the property of the U.S. Navy.
It wasn’t immediately clear where the boat originated and it was turned over to the Naval Weapons station for further inspection, the news station reported.",1
2661,"The U.S. Senate was short of the votes needed to approve a bill to keep the federal government running as a midnight deadline loomed on Friday night, although high-level negotiations continued.
In a dramatic late-night session, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell left voting open despite appearing to fall well short of the 60 votes needed to keep alive a stopgap bill that would fund the government through Feb. 16.
As the clock ticked toward midnight, McConnell and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer huddled in negotiations in a room just off the Senate floor.
Without some type of funding bill, the U.S. government technically will run out of money right after midnight, on the first anniversary of President Donald Trump’s inauguration. That would leave scores of federal agencies across the country unable to continue operating, and hundreds of thousands of “non-essential” federal workers would be put on temporary unpaid leave.
The Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a stopgap funding measure on Thursday. But Republicans then needed the support of at least 10 Democrats to pass the bill in the Senate.
Democratic leaders demanded that the measure include protections for hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants known as “Dreamers” who arrived in the United States as children with their parents. Republicans refused and neither side has been willing to back down.
Trump last week rejected a bipartisan proposal, saying he wanted to include any deal for Dreamers in a bigger legislative package that also boosts funding for a border wall and tighter security at the U.S. border with Mexico.
In a shutdown, “essential” employees who deal with public safety and national security would keep working. That includes more than 1.3 million people on active duty in the military who would be required to work and would not be paid until funding is renewed.Although past government shutdowns have done little lasting damage to the U.S. economy, they can rattle financial markets.
A new shutdown now would trigger a political battle between Democrats and Republicans over who is to blame.This week’s showdown follows a months-long struggle in Congress to agree on government funding levels and the immigration issue.
Democrats have demanded the bill include protections from deportation for about 700,000 Dreamers, who are predominantly from Mexico and Central America and were given temporary legal status under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program started by former President Barack Obama.
In September, Trump announced he was ending the program and giving Congress until March 5 to come up with a legislative replacement.
Trump pointed the finger at his political rivals earlier on Friday.
“Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. Shutdown coming?” he said.
Democrats say the search for a deal has been hurt by Trump sending contradictory messages about what kind of bipartisan immigration proposal he would accept.",0
2299,"In the summer of 2017, a foreign student in Michigan received an email from an official at the University of Farmington.
""It was a pleasure speaking with you,"" university official Ali Milani wrote to the student from India. ""Thank you for your recent interest in The University of Farmington, a nationally accredited business and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) institution. Here at the University of Farmington we have created an innovative learning environment that combines traditional instruction with fulltime professional experiences. We offer flexible class schedules and a focus on students who do not want to interrupt their careers.""
At the bottom of the email, it described the university as: ""A nationally accredited institution authorized to enroll international students by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.""
The email and others like it were obtained by the Detriot Free Press, revealing how the university portrayed itself to potential foreign students. The email exchanges with Ali Milani — who is described in a LinkedIn profile as the president of the University of Farmington — show how the school in Farmington Hills may have lured students to enroll in a fake university set up by The Department of Homeland Security.
Jan. 30: Feds set up fake university in Michigan to nab undocumented immigrants
A federal indictment unsealed Jan. 30 said that the university was produced by federal agents with an investigative division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is part of DHS. Federal agents posed as university officials such as ""Ali Milani"" to trick the students, say attorneys.
Federal prosecutors allege that more than 600 students enrolled at the university knew it was improper, but the emails and attorneys tell a different story.
In addition to the emails, federal undercover agents took other steps to manipulate the foreign students, according to public records and attorneys:
Undercover investigators with the Department of Homeland Security registered the University of Farmington with the state of Michigan as a university using a fake name.
At the request of DHS, a national accreditation agency listed the University of Farmington as being accredited in order to help deceive prospective students.
The university was also placed by federal investigators on the website of ICE as an university approved by them under a government program for foreign students known as SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Program).
""It seems quite clear the scheme was set up by the government not to go after legitimate offenders, but to create fear in our immigration system,"" said Amer Zahr, an adjunct professor of law at the University of Detroit-Mercy and a spokesman for one of the 146 students who were detained by ICE. ""They're going after students who are trying to better their lives, because America has the best education.This is who they're choosing to go after? It's really disturbing.""
Out of the 600+ students who were enrolled, 146 have been arrested and detained by ICE on civil immigration charges. All are from India except for Najlaa Karim Musarsa, 29, of Dearborn Heights, who is Palestinian. She was released last week and went back to the West Bank.
In addition, prosecutors have charged eight people for being recruiters of the students, most of whom studied in engineering and technology fields. Five of them were arraigned in U.S. district court in Detroit last week and pled not guilty.
Feb. 3: India urges U.S. to release foreign students detained by ICE in fake university sting
""It really shows a contempt for immigrants, Zahr said of the detaining of Musarsa and other students.
""She's not a danger to society. She's not trying to defraud. To treat her and others as hardcore criminals"" is concerning, Zahr said. ""They want to create fear, so non-white people, brown people don't think of coming to America anymore.""

Concern about the detainees
There are reports in Indian-American and Indian media outlets such as The American Bazaar saying that some of the students were being held in poor conditions and not getting vegetarian food in accordance with their religious and cultural beliefs. Some students were already removed, and are now stuck in India with debt, said a Times of India report. The report said some come from poor farming backgrounds and had to take out loans to support their studies in the U.S.The university charged $11,000 a year for graduate students.
On Thursday, four U.S. House Reps, including U.S. House Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Southfield) released a letter they sent to DHS and ICE, expressing ""concerns surrounding the recent undercover operation conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI)."" The Indian government has also expressed its concern in a letter from its Ministry of External Affairs.
The letter from the Congressmen said that Indian-Americans ""have expressed concerns regarding the treatment of these detained foreign nationals. We urge DHS and ICE to ensure the detained students are treated properly and afforded all rights provided to them under the law, including access to an attorney and release on bond, if they are eligible.""
In a statement, ICE spokesman Khaalid Walls said: ""ICE remains committed to ensuring its facilities adhere to ICE’s detention standards which provide several levels of oversight in order to ensure that residents in ICE custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments.""
Many of the students who were enrolled at the University of Farmington had previously received masters degrees from a different university, like the student that Milani had written to. The name of the student in the email is not being identified at the request of an attorney.
They were generally admitted to the U.S. on non-immigrant F-1 student visas and were allowed to work while enrolled at a university on programs known as OPT (Optional Practical Training) or CPT (Curricular Practical Training), said attorneys in contact with the students. Some were trying to get H1-B visas to stay for a longer time in America, but there is a cap on those, and so they sought other ways to remain working in the U.S.
Attorney: Fake university sting by ICE was entrapment
After their masters degree programs ended, the students would be ineligible to remain working in the U.S. and so some sought to get a second masters degree at the University of Farmington. In other cases, their previous universities had problems with accreditation, which made them ineligible to work, and so they tried to transfer, said Atlanta-based immigration attorney Ravi Mannam.
Emails from the university to student
In the June 2017 email sent by Milani, the president of the fake university, Milani wrote to the Indian student: ""In many instances, your prior Masters Degree’s (MA) credits, combined with CPT, can be applied to a second MA in lieu of a traditional course load.""
Milani wrote to the student about its tuition and accreditation: ""The University of Farmington operates on a quarterly academic calendar, each term is generally ten weeks, excluding exams, and the admissions process is on a rolling basis. Terms start every three months, beginning in September, December, March, and June. Sessions begin every month. Graduate programs tuition is $2500 per quarter. Depending on fees, average cost is $1,000 per month.""
""We are accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (www.accsc.org) and licensed by the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs as a private postsecondary college,"" he wrote.
The executive director of the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC), Michale McComis, told the Free Press that his group worked with federal agents on the sting operation.
""Upon request by the US Department of Homeland Security ACCSC assisted in the operation by listing the school as being accredited by ACCSC,"" McComis said.
The same group had accredited a fake University of Northern New Jersey at the request of DHS. In that case, though, ICE didn't make mass arrests of students like they have of the Farmington students.
Records filed with the state Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) show that the University of Farmington was incorporated in January 2016. Prosecutors have said their undercover operation started in 2015.
Ali Milani is listed in the state records as the university's resident agent. A spokesman for LARA, Jason Moon, refused to comment on the fake university and whether the state had cooperated with federal investigators on their sting investigation.

Many of the students were trying to work while enrolled in a university, which is an accepted practice approved by the U.S. government.
In the June 2017 email to the student, Milani sent the student a 2-page application form that asks applicants to send a $100 application fee.
""If you are interested in having your tomorrow start today, please complete the attached application and submit a copy of your passport and current visa,"" Milani wrote.
His email ended with: ""Good luck in all your endeavors.""
The student filled out the application and emailed Milani back in a couple of hours. The next day, June 29, Milani said the student was admitted, writing that he was attaching the ""admission letter along with the international student checklist and SEVIS transfer form.""
SEVIS is the Student and Exchange Visitor Program that is run by ICE, which oversees the program for students on F-1 visas, like the ones at the University of Farmington.
The next week, the student asked to defer his admission until December. In October, the student then asked Milani to transfer his SEVIS ""today"" because his OPT expires.
""I have been trying to reach out to you since morning, but couldn't get hold of it. Please let me know ASAP, its URGENT,"" the student wrote.
After enrolling at the university, some of the students discovered there were no classes, said attorneys. But the university kept on telling the students that classes would soon be held.

Students 'taken advantage of'
""I was told by the students, that the university reassured them that classes would be held and everything would be fine and that they are following the immigration laws,"" said Prashanthi Reddy, an attorney in New York City. ""The students payed them the tuition fees and were trapped once they realized that classes were not being held, as some didn't have the money to transfer and pay tuition at another university.""
Reddy said ""some did transfer out, some said they called and emailed the university and asked for SEVIS to be transferred but did not get a response, some others said they were reassured by the fact that the University was accredited and listed on the ICE website.""
Adding to the confusion was a website that led viewers to think it was a legitimate place, with photos of students in classrooms and claims that students could work while enrolled.
""The University of Farmington is a nationally accredited business and STEM institution located in Metro Detroit,"" read the university website created by DHS that was taken down the day after the indictments were unsealed. ""Our innovative curriculum combines traditional instruction and distance learning with fulltime professional experiences. We offer flexible class schedules and a focus on students who do not want to interrupt their careers.""
The university even had a fake backstory, saying that it ""traces its lineage back to the early 1950s, when returning soldiers from the Second World War were seeking a quality and marketable education. At the time, Detroit was the center of innovation and manufacturing. ... Please explore our academic offerings to see if University of Farmington is the right place to achieve your success.""
""It was a very well put together website,"" said Russell Abrutyn, an immigration attorney in Berkley who is contact with some of the students. ""It looked like a real school.""
""I think a lot of these students ... were essentially taken advantage of or taken in by what appeared to be a legitimate school."" ",0
2579,"The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives voted on Friday to restore funding for some federal agencies that have been shut down by a fight with President Donald Trump over border wall funding, as an estimated 800,000 government workers, from tax collectors to FBI agents, missed their first paycheck.
But a full resumption of government operations at those agencies did not appear in sight. The Senate adjourned for the weekend without taking action, and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will not bring the House bill up for a vote. Republicans who control the Senate have so far stood with Trump and insisted that any spending bills include money for his wall.
The House bill, which passed 240-179 with only 10 Republicans supporting it, would restore funding for the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, two of the agencies that have been without funding since Dec. 22 amid the standoff over the proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The $35.9 billion bill provides $6 billion more than Trump requested.
Facing the prospect of the longest U.S. government shutdown in history, Trump has said he might declare a national emergency to bypass Congress to get funding for his wall, which was a central promise of his 2016 presidential campaign.
Entering its 21st day, the partial shutdown on Friday tied the record for the longest in U.S. history.
Miami International Airport said it will close one of its terminals early over the next several days due to a possible shortage of security screeners, who have been calling in sick at twice the normal rate.
A union that represents thousands of air traffic controllers sued the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday, saying it had violated federal wage law by failing to pay workers. It is at least the third lawsuit filed by unions on behalf of unpaid workers.
Some 800,000 federal workers did not receive paychecks that would have gone out on Friday. Some have resorted to selling their possessions or posting appeals on online fundraising outlets to help pay their bills.
“Most of them are living from paycheck to paycheck and now they approach this day on Friday having moved from paycheck to no check,” Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings said in debate on the House floor.
The head of the U.S. Secret Service, which is responsible for protecting Trump, warned employees that financial stress can lead to depression and anxiety. “Keep an eye out for warning signs of trouble,” Director R.D. “Tex” Alles wrote in a memo seen by OutletName.
Vice President Mike Pence said Trump will sign legislation passed in Congress that will provide back pay to federal workers once the government reopens.
“Your families will get your paychecks,” he told U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at the agency’s Washington headquarters.
Separately, Senator Rob Portman and eight other Republican senators introduced legislation that would permanently outlaw the closing of government operations during budget fights, underscoring the growing frustration in Washington.
During his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly pledged that Mexico would pay for the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs. But the Mexican government has refused and Trump is now demanding that Congress provide $5.7 billion in U.S. taxpayer funding for the wall.
Democrats in Congress call the wall an ineffective, outdated answer to a complex problem.
With no Capitol Hill compromise in sight, Trump publicly ruminated on Thursday during a trip to the Texas-Mexico border trip about declaring an emergency.
A close Trump confidant judged the time for such a step had come. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said in a statement: “It is time for President Trump to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier. I hope it works.”
Critics of the national emergency strategy have said it may be illegal. In any case, it was almost certain to trigger an immediate court challenge from Democrats, including an accusation of trying to circumvent Congress’ power over the national purse strings.
An emergency declaration would come with risks. Even some of Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress have signaled worries about such an action. Given that the Constitution gives Congress the power to set spending priorities and appropriate money, they worry about a tough legal fight and an unwise precedent.“I don’t think he should do that. It’s a bad precedent,” Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said on COutletName. “It seems to me that
An emergency declaration, however, would allow the government to be fully reopened while the judges weigh the case, which could take months.",0
1487,"A foreigner who immigrates to the U.S. doesn’t just get a shot at a better life. That person also in effect gets a voucher with which to share the prospect of a future in the U.S. with relatives. That is the essence of family reunification, the channel by which most immigrants have come to the U.S. since the 1960s. It is a source of growing dissatisfaction with the immigration system. Chain migration, as critics refer to successive rounds of family-based admissions, tilts the immigrant pool away from young, skilled workers best equipped to prosper and assimilate. It is a key reason so many reformers envy Australia and Canada, two countries that accept more than twice as many migrants per capita as the U.S. while allocating a smaller share of those slots to family members. Lately, the case against family-based migration has taken a strident turn. Immigration restrictionists, including President Donald Trump, portray it as a conduit for terrorism and crime. It is a charge built on flimsy evidence that evokes the xenophobia of a century ago. In 1924, Congress imposed quotas on immigrants according to national origin to halt the influx of southern and eastern Europeans that nativists considered racially inferior, a threat to native-born workers and riddled with communist sympathizers. By virtually slamming the door shut on newcomers, lawmakers aimed to maintain western and northern Europeans’ ethnic majority. By the 1960s the national origins system had become a source of shame. Determined to extend the cause of civil rights to immigration, then-President Lyndon Johnson declared in 1964, “A nation that was built by the immigrants of all lands can ask those who now seek admission: ‘What can you do for our country?’ But we should not be asking: ‘In what country were you born?’” The Immigration Act of 1965 replaced national origin with criteria based on skill and family ties. The definition of family was expanded, from spouses and small children to include adult children, siblings and parents. This was actually a concession to nativists. Most of the foreign born at the time came from Europe and they were expected to sponsor the most family members. But most European-born people were too old to have many relatives to sponsor. Instead, as Marta Tienda, a demographer at Princeton University, has documented, the provision’s effect was first felt when Asian workers who came under employment visas then sponsored their parents. The pattern was later repeated by Latin American workers, including illegal workers legalized in 1986. Ms. Tienda found that sponsorship of parents tended to raise the average age of these immigrants. A report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development notes family-based immigrants were on average less educated, less fluent in English and less likely to be employed than employment-based immigrants, though employment rose with time. The U.S. has long admitted immigrants for noneconomic reasons, for instance to give shelter to victims of persecution and war and to reunite divided families. The policy is driven in part by a simple belief that immigrants—no matter the reason for moving—possess a fierce determination to improve their lives, which makes all of the country stronger. In a legal sense, family migrants don’t displace skilled migrants or refugees since all are subject to different caps. Since 2007, family-based admissions have fluctuated around 800,000 a year and employment-based around 150,000. But in a political sense, family migrants do displace skilled migrants. Every country has a finite appetite for immigrants and the more that inflow is filled by family migrants, the less the appetite for refugees or skilled workers. This leads to the elements of a compromise: narrow the criteria for family migration, as restrictionists want, while expanding the number of skilled migrants as liberalizers have urged. While the total pool could remain around 1 million, the nation’s aging native-born workforce easily justifies a far larger intake. Extended family could still come, but under stricter criteria. Above a quota, Australia charges sponsors a hefty fee for elderly parents to defray the cost of social services. Aspiring immigrants to Canada get credit under its point system if they already have relatives there. Yet many restrictionists want to end chain migration to reduce, not maintain or expand, overall immigration. It is a key factor holding up a deal to legalize 690,000 illegal immigrants, known as Dreamers, who arrived as children, even though most wouldn’t or couldn’t sponsor relatives other than spouses. Mr. Trump has already signaled that his opposition to chain migration isn’t about economics. This week his administration released a report that attributed 73% of 549 terrorist acts convicted in U.S. courts between the Sept. 11, 2001, attack at the World Trade Center and 2016, to the foreign born, many family migrants. The methodology seems crafted to accentuate the threat: it excluded domestic acts of terrorism (such as by white supremacists) and included acts carried out on foreign soil. Many of the convicted were planning or supporting terrorism; they didn’t kill or injure anyone. The actual number of deaths in the U.S. attributable to foreign-born terrorists since the start of 2002 is 34, according to Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute, meaning you were 1,641 times more likely to be killed in a garden-variety homicide. When an entire class of the foreign born is vilified on such dubious grounds, it severs the debate from hard-nosed economic and public policy considerations, and puts reasoned agreement even further out of reach.",0
647,"Donald Trump, our wannabee dictator and demagogue took another dangerous step to dishonor democracy Friday when he said he could declare a national emergency and build his wall by executive fiat. Trump said “I could do it if I wanted.” Hello banana republic! Goodbye democracy! If I was a member of the Federalist Society (which I’m not), I would worry a lot about Trump’s disposition to abuse our constitution tradition of checks and balances.
Trump’s position is reminiscent of French King Louis XIV’s famous dictum “L’Etat, c’est moi”, which freely translates into English as “I’m the king, so it’s my way or the highway or in this case, the wall.” Since Donald Trumpthinks he’s the state, he figures as long as he’s working it doesn’t matter if the United States government is shut down for months or even years.
Well he can declare a national emergency and raid money from the Pentagon for fake national security to build the wall. That’s one way to end the Trump Shutdown. Or he can throw another terrible two tantrum like he did the other day when it became clear to him that he couldn’t get what he wanted when he wanted it.
Or he could act like an adult instead of a spoiled child and try is to reach a compromise agreement with congressional leadership along the lines of comprehensive immigration reform plans proposed by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. These presidential compromise proposals would have increased border security spending by $68 billion (Obama proposal), provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and crack down on businesses for illegal hiring.
There’s no evidence the wall would halt immigration but facts don’t matter to the president. During the 2008 GOP presidential campaign, Governor Rick Perry of Texas criticized Mitt Romney’s border wall proposal by pointing out that anybody with a 11 foot ladder can get over a 10 foot tall fence.
Rather than compromise, Trump would rather demagogue the issue which he tried to do during the midterm election campaign with disastrous results. The national exit poll indicated that twice as many midterm voters picked health care over immigration as the reason for their decision. The health care voters supported Democrats by a three to one margin. The immigration voters went GOP but there weren’t nearly enough of them to help Republicans preserve their majority in the House.
Now that electoral democracy 2018 style failed Trump, he wants to resort to executive fiat which is not exactly what the founders of our great nation intended. I’m a part time college professor and I emphasize the study of the U.S. Constitution when I teach Introduction to American Government and Politics. I’m always thought Donald Trump would benefit greatly if he took POS 101. But I guess he can’t since he bankrupted Trump University before starting his quest to bankrupt the nation morally and financially.
The founders were scared to death of a tin horn dictator rising to power. To ward off the danger of a power hungry demagogue usurping power in the young democracy, they developed a system where that plays one branch of government against another so one person ever gets to do what he or she wants without regard to the other players.
There’s good news and bad news after 239 years of constitutional trial and error. The good news is that a dictator has never ruled over the United States. No dictators like Hitler, Mao or Stalin have risen on our shores. Not yet anyway! Score one for the founders!
The bad news in our democracy is that things change slowly. It would be better if the nation improved quickly but that’s better than losing our democratic and free form of government.
We have a very complicated and messy system of checks and balances that makes it difficult to solve the big problems facing the nation. The downside is that gridlock prevents the United States from attacking climate change, adapting to a post industrial economy or paving the way for a social change. If the president really wants to satisfy his edifice complex and build something, he should get serious about rebuilding our obsolete economic, electronic and educational infrastructure which would be a real memorial to his tattered presidency.
America might change quickly if the president ruled by executive fiat but that kind of change would drive our nation to hell in a hand basket faster than you can say Mussolini. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. often said “the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice. If Donald Trump had his way, the arc would break not bend. Then there would be no justice or democracy at all. Maybe that’s what the he really wants.",1
2644,"The U.S. Supreme Court closed the door at least for now on President Donald Trump’s effort to end protections for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants dubbed “Dreamers,” with the justices again silent on Tuesday on three related appeals.
Unless the court breaks with its normal procedure, the nine justices would not be able to hear arguments and decide the case in its current term, which ends in June. If they eventually agree to hear the matter, it most likely would be decided during their nine-month term that begins in October, meaning a ruling could come in the 2020 presidential election year.
The Justice Department has filed appeals concerning the Republican president’s September 2017 move, blocked by lower courts, to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program implemented in 2012 by his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.
DACA protects about 700,000 immigrants, often called “Dreamers” based on the name of the Dream Act legislation that failed to pass Congress, from deportation and provides them work permits, though not a path to citizenship. Most of the “Dreamers” are Hispanic young adults.
With the lower courts ruling against the administration and the high court not yet taking action, DACA remains in place.
After Tuesday, the high court is not in session for almost a month and the justices are not due to meet again privately to discuss action on pending appeals until Feb. 15.
Trump on Saturday proposed a deal to end the ongoing partial government shutdown that would include a three-year extension of DACA protections in return for congressional Democrats agreeing to allow $5.7 billion in funding to help pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrats, who oppose the wall, rejected the offer.
Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer on Saturday noted that it was Trump who moved to rescind DACA and that the president’s offer of a temporary extension of some protections for the Dreamers in exchange for wall money was not a compromise but “more hostage-taking.”
Trump’s tough immigration policies have been a hallmark of his presidency, backing limits on legal and illegal immigration since taking office in January 2017.",0
2643,"Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and U.S. President Donald Trump will meet at the end of this month to discuss trade, immigration and security issues, as the Latin American leader faces increased populist pressure at home.
Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer told a news conference on Saturday that the two leaders will meet on Jan. 31, the week after senior officials of both administrations hold bilateral talks in Washington.
Trump is committed to renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and would move to withdraw if no ""fair deal"" is forthcoming, according to the White House website.
Pena Nieto, whose popularity has plummeted due to corruption scandals and rising inflation, has been criticized for lacking a clear strategy to counter Trump's threats to crimp trade and deport illegal immigrants.
Seeking to capitalize on that discontent, Mexican 2018 presidential forerunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Saturday said he would tour major U.S. cities starting in February.
""Enough of being passive,"" Lopez Obrador of the leftist Moreno party said in a statement. ""We should put a national emergency plan in place to face the damage and reverse the protectionist policies of Donald Trump.""
Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor mounting his third presidential bid, said at a rally in the border city of Ciudad Acuna that he would ""stop the hate promoted by propaganda against migrants.""
Many in Mexico are worried about another Trump promise, that he will make Mexico pay for a border wall, possibly by blocking wire transfers out of the United States from Mexican nationals.
""We shouldn't pay for the wall,"" said Christina Validez, waiting to pick up a wire transfer from her husband in the United States at a bank in Ixmiquilpan.
""It's the other way around, all United States presidents should be grateful that all the migrants have helped the economy.""
The area around Ixmiquilpan, in the central state of Hidalgo and home to some 94,000 people, received about $100 million in foreign remittances in 2015, according to data from Mexico's central bank, more than 10 times the municipal government's annual budget.
Validez said she depends on the money sent back to make ends meet and she complained about ""everything"" becoming more expensive after the government hiked regular gasoline prices by 14 percent at the start of the year.
Looting and violent protests followed the gasoline hike around the country. Two people died in Ixmiquilpan in clashes with state and federal police after protesters blockaded a highway and burnt vehicles.
On Saturday, Mexicans, many with relatives in the United States, queued for hours outside a bank located in an appliance store in Ixmiquilpan's town center.
The store had cut back hours, opening only briefly, to process wire transfers and payments after protesters angry about the gasoline hike forced the closure of stores owned by big corporations, demanding support of local businesses.
Stores in the town owned by Wal-Mart and convenience store operator Femsa were forced to close and were still shuttered two weeks later.
On Friday, people gathered outside a Ford Motor Co showroom in the capital to protest the company's cancellation of a $1.6 billion investment in an auto plant in Mexico after months of pressure from Trump.
During his U.S. tour, Lopez Obrador, who finished second to Pena Nieto in the 2012 presidential vote, plans to meet people of Mexican origin living in major cities, starting Feb. 12 in Los Angeles, then to Chicago, Phoenix and others.
Pena Nieto said earlier on Saturday that he highlighted the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship on a call with Trump.
""We don't know if the government is defending us, if it's with us or not,"" said Margarita Escamilla, a legal resident in the United States from Ixmiquilpan visiting family.
Lopez Obrador ""is like all of them, saying he's going to defend migrants but who knows ... they promise and promise and it stays the same,"" she said.",0
854,"Political commentator Michelle Malkin said the Democratic stance on illegal immigration will carry over into the 2020 elections and have a negative impact on the party’s electoral results.
“When you have the Democrats booing because President Trump was exposing and continuing to hammer the fact that these caravans are endangering the country and posing enormous costs to people at the border, let alone in the interior, this is a message I think is going to resonate all the way through 2020, and it’s going to pose a huge optics problem for the Democrat party,” Malkin said.
“They can laugh and snicker and sneer and smirk and sit in their seats and have their little temper tantrums. But the vast majority of Americans want something done about immigration. And sitting there and smirking is not the answer.”
Malkin also said it was important for Trump to call attention to illegal immigration while offering solutions to ease the crisis. “I think it underscores an important point that President Trump himself has made in the face of this debate and the intransigence of the open borders Democrats — and that it’s not just about a wall. As long as you have these magnets drawing people here and everybody’s aware of it around the world, it’s not going to stop,” she said earlier in the interview.
“And that is a point that President Trump made during the address last night. … President Trump delivered very defining moments that contrast the differences between the parties.”",1
2632,"U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the Senate would vote this week on President Donald Trump’s proposal to end a partial government shutdown.
McConnell made the remarks on the Senate floor, three days after Trump called on lawmakers to approve $5.7 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border with Mexico in exchange for temporary protections for so-called Dreamers who illegally immigrated to the United States as children and for people who hold temporary protected immigration status.
House Democrats have dismissed the proposal as a non-starter.",0
1254,"President Trump warned the Honduras government on Tuesday that it would cut off aid to the country if a caravan of Honduran migrants headed for the U.S. wasn’t stopped, as Mexican authorities took measures to prevent the caravan from marching north. “If the large Caravan of people heading to the U.S. is not stopped and brought back to Honduras, no more money or aid will be given to Honduras, effective immediately!” Mr. Trump tweeted. Later on Tuesday, Guatemalan authorities arrested the leader of the caravan, Bartolo Fuentes, a former leftist lawmaker and social activist from Honduras. A Guatemalan migration official said Mr. Fuentes will be deported back to Honduras. In Mexico, federal police, soldiers and immigration agents were deployed to the southern border ahead of the caravan’s expected arrival. The migrant caravan with more than 1,500 Hondurans entered Guatemala on Monday afternoon, where authorities were unable to prevent such a large group from crossing the border. Honduran television showed a human tide, while Guatemalan policemen looked at the caravan on the sidelines, overwhelmed. Hundreds of migrants chanted “yes, we did it! yes, we did it!” as they crossed the border checkpoint. Honduran officials, who had limited ability to halt the large migrant group as it had already left the country, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on Mr. Trump’s remarks. The foreign ministry said on Sunday that hundreds of Hondurans were being misled with “false promises” of caravan leaders. A spokesman for Guatemala’s migration agency didn’t respond to requests for comment. Many migrants, including dozens of parents traveling with their children and toddlers, spent the night in a square in Esquipulas, a Guatemalan town near the border with Honduras. The migrants left San Pedro Sula, one of the world’s most violent cities, on Saturday, by foot and hitchhiking. Some mothers pushed their babies in carriages. The caravan got started earlier this month with a call on social media, as some 200 people agreed to travel together to better protect themselves against the criminal gangs that prey on migrants on the dangerous trek north. By the time they left San Pedro Sula, the caravan had 1,200 people, Mr. Fuentes wrote on Facebook. It kept growing as they marched toward Mexico. Mr. Fuentes told Honduran television that the goal is to get to Tapachula, a Mexican city near the border with Guatemala. The migrants left Esquipulas on Tuesday, heading toward Guatemala City, where they expect to arrive at night, said Walter Coello, a Honduran taxi driver who helps organize the migrant group. Mr. Coello said they are determined to continue the journey, despite Mr. Trump’s threats. “We cannot go back. We don’t have any future in Honduras. So much poverty and violence. That’s not an option,” he added. He says he left his wife and two daughters in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, where street gangs took most of his income through extortion. The developments come after Mexico reached a deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement with the Trump administration in late August. Both governments have also pledged to foster cooperation to contain illegal migration to the U.S. The U.S. plans to send about $66 million in aid to Honduras in fiscal year 2019, according to the State Department. Most of the funds go to violence prevention, justice and rule-of-law programs, along with funding for border and narcotics enforcement. In a speech last week, Vice President Mike Pence said the U.S. will continue to take “decisive action” to address what he termed an immigration “crisis.” He singled out Honduras’s border control efforts and thanked Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández for taking steps to “root out corruption and defeat the criminal networks within your borders. U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Katie Waldman argued Tuesday that the caravan highlights the need to change current rules at the U.S. border. “The current reporting on the migrant ‘caravan’ from Honduras is what we see day-in and day-out at the border as a result of well-advertised and well-known catch-and-release loopholes. As we have said time and again, until Congress acts, we will continue to have de facto open borders,” she said. The Mexican government said on Monday that it won’t allow migrants who don’t meet Mexican visa requirements and that the country’s migration agents would have to review them individually. A spokeswoman for Mexico’s migration agency said that because of the large size of the group seeking to get to the U.S. border, the migrants are unlikely to be eligible for humanitarian or transit visas. Mexican officials said Tuesday that Federal Police commissioner Manelich Castilla was in Tapachula overseeing the deployment of security agents at border crossings. Rodrigo Abeja, a social activist with human rights advocacy group People without Frontiers, said federal police agents and soldiers arrived earlier on Tuesday to the town of Ciudad Hidalgo, in the border with Guatemala, and set up several checkpoints. Honduran nationals must file for Mexican visas at a consulate or request asylum at border checkpoints. They can also get transit visas if they have residence permits from a third country, such as the U.S., or hold a U.S. tourist visa. Mexico’s announcement marks a shift in migration policy. In April, the government granted transit and humanitarian visas to a large Central American migrant caravan heading to the U.S., a move that infuriated Mr. Trump. When the caravan reached the border, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the crossing was full and couldn’t process asylum seekers. The Mexican government wants to signal to this and future caravans that coming en masse doesn’t mean migrants will be able to enter the country without screening, and to show that it has policies and laws on immigration enforcement, said Maureen Meyer, head of the Mexico and migrant rights program at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human-rights advocacy group. “The previous caravan prompted unjustified and harsh criticism by Mr. Trump that Mexico wasn’t doing anything on immigration enforcement,” Ms. Meyer said. “The U.S. and Mexico governments also need to ensure that anyone traveling in this caravan who wants to seek protection has the right to do so.”",0
2386,"President Trump receives a briefing on a semi-submersible used by drug smugglers during a visit to Joint Interagency Task Force South at Naval Air Station in Key West, Fla. President Trump resumed his attacks Thursday on ""sanctuary cities"" and California Gov. Jerry Brown's plan to restrict National Guard patrols along the Mexican border.
""There’s a little bit of a revolution going on in California,” Trump told reporters while touring a joint inter-agency task force in Key West, Fla., that is responsible for drug interdiction.
Trump praised the agency's work on drug and human smuggling, maintaining that ""human trafficking is worse than it's ever been in the history of the world.”
Polaris, a project dedicated to fighting modern slavery, says ""the International Labour Organization estimates that there are 40.3 million victims of human trafficking globally, though there are no statistics for the slave trade of centuries past.
Trump toured the Key West facility after threatening to withhold federal funds for a National Guard deployment in California. The president was angered that Brown said the troops would not enforce federal immigration law or participate in the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Instead, Brown said he would send 400 National Guard troops to focus on human trafficking as well as drug and gun crimes.
Governor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy “up to 400 National Guard Troops” to do nothing. The crime rate in California is high enough, and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown’s charade. We need border security and action, not words! — Donald J. Trump () April 19, 2018
In a tweet prior to his Key West visit, Trump said Brown is committing the National Guard to ""do nothing,"" and ""the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown’s charade.""
He added: ""We need border security and action, not words!""
Brown had responded grudgingly to Trump's request to deploy the National Guard on the Mexican border. He told reporters this week that the emphasis should be on public safety.
""That sounds like fighting crime,"" Brown said. ""Trying to catch some desperate mothers and children, or unaccompanied minors coming from Central America, that sounds like something else.”
Trump has long railed against ""sanctuary cities,"" defined as areas where governments decline to enforce immigration laws against undocumented people.
After his Key West trip, the president returned to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., where he is spending the week.",0
2295,"President Donald Trump on Monday took a jab at El Paso Mayor Dee Margo, saying he was ""full of crap"" if he did not believe border fencing made the city safer.
""When that wall went up, it was a whole different ballgame,"" Trump said, referring to fencing along the El Paso border with Mexico. ""I don’t care if a mayor is a Republican or a Democrat. They are full of crap if they say it doesn’t make a difference.""
Margo, a Republican, has disputed Trump's State of the Union claim that El Paso was among the most dangerous cities in the country before border fencing was installed.
""My job as mayor is to represent El Paso factually and with integrity, correcting any misstatements negatively reflecting on our community,"" Margo told the El Paso Times after the president spoke. He later tweeted the same statement. ""I don’t focus on political rhetoric, only facts so that my statements will never be questioned.""
Trump's statements have been widely disputed by city leaders and multiple fact checks, including one by the El Paso Times.
Some form of barrier has existed between El Paso and Juárez for decades, whether it was a chain-link fence at different stretches of the border or the more substantial barrier that stands today.
According to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, violent crime in El Paso fell dramatically between 1993 and 2006. From 2006 to 2011 — two years before the fence was built to two years after — the number of recorded violent crimes in El Paso increased by 17 percent, the reports say. The figures were below the average for large U.S. cities.
Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke held a dueling rally near the El Paso County Coliseum, where Trump spoke to 6,500 people inside and several thousand outside.
O'Rourke's rally drew a crowd that organizers estimate to be between 6,000 and 7,000. Official estimates were not provided by police.
“With the eyes of the country upon us, all of us together are going to make our stand,” O'Rourke told the crowd of several thousand at his rally. “Here in one of the safest cities in the USA. Safe not because of walls but in spite of walls.""
The Democrat, who is contemplating entering the 2020 presidential election, decried the Republican president's hard-line rhetoric on immigration that has become the centerpiece of his administration.
Trump arrived in El Paso for his first of campaign appearance of 2019 even as local leaders from both parties have stoutly contested the assertion that the region was saved from rampant cross-border violent crime by the fencing that went up more than 10 years ago.
Trump's wide-ranging address touched on topics from Texas' booming oil and gas industry to his take on the Democrats seeking to oust him in 2020.
The central focus for Trump was funding for his long-promised border wall and a flat rejection of the statistics and officials who are standing in his way.
""We need the wall,"" Trump said. ""And it has to be built, and we have to build it fast.""
The El Paso County Coliseum holds about 6,500 people, but President Donald Trump told the crowd that his campaign got special permission from the El Paso Fire Department to let 10,000 inside.
""If you want to really see something go outside,"" he said. ""Tens of thousands of people are watching"" on monitors.
An El Paso Fire Department spokesman on Monday said the president's claim about the number of people in the coliseumm was incorrect.
Enrique D Aguilar, fire public information officer, said no special permission was given by the Fire Department, and the Coliseum had about 6,500 people in it during the president's rally — at capacity, but well within its standard allowance.
Aguilar said ""it might be 10,000 with the people outside"" total, but the Fire Department did not track the number of people outside. The Coliseum was full at about 4 p.m., and thousands watched the president's speech on big screens outside.
El Paso, which shares a border with Juarez, Mexico, is one of the most reliably Democratic strongholds in Republican-led Texas.
Trump garnered only 26 percent of the vote in El Paso during the 2016 general election.
“This is personal. It’s an attack on our city, our community and our families,"" said U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who served as El Paso County judge before her election to Congress last year. ""That being said, we welcome the president. He has the opportunity to correct the record and to see the consequences of his administration’s policies.""
President Donald Trump boards Air Force One as he leaves Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Monday, Feb. 11, 2019, for a trip to El Paso. Trump will hold his first campaign rally since November's midterm elections in El Paso as he faces a defining week for his push for a border wall, his presidency and his 2020 prospects. The president arrived at El Paso International Airport aboard Air Force One around 6:30 p.m. local time. But his supporters began lining up as many as 10 hours before that.
At the arena, Trump was welcomed by scores of supporters, some of whom traveled from neighboring New Mexico and Arizona to cheer his calls for greater security on the nation's southern border.
Both of Texas' Republican U.S. senators, John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, were called to warm up the crowd inside the arena ahead the president's arrival. When Cruz exclaimed, ""It is time to build the wall,” the crowd erupted and echoed with the signature chant, ""Build the wall! Build the wall.""
Nearly all wore Trump regalia, from ""Make America Great Again"" ball caps to ""Trump 2020 shirts and buttons.
Democratic leaders, led by former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, participated in what they call a ""March for Truth"" to combat Trump's statements about the border city.
Buttons backing a presidential run by Beto O'Rourke are on sale Monday before his rally. El Paso native Yolanda Moreno was among the first to assemble outside the city's Bowie High School not far from the existing fencing at the border.
“I initially had tickets to the Trump rally, then my son brought this (rally) to my attention,” said Moreno, who purchased a ""Beto for President"" flag for the occasion. The reason she wanted to attend the Trump event, she said, was “to hear what he had to say. Hear his lies.”
But the president's supporters said they were drawn to his message and to the policies he's pursued during his two years in the White House.
“Since the president announced his campaign, we liked what he offered the veterans, the tax proposal, and so far he has held to his promises,” said Ismael Lozado, an El Paso resident who arrived at the coliseum around 1:30 p.m. “I do believe we need a wall as a country. Any country needs to defend its borders.”
At the Trump rally, the president's son and namesake took a shot at the O'Rourke-led event.
“I would be more impressed if he had the guts to do his rally on the Juarez side of the wall,"" said Donald Trump Jr.
""Finish the Wall"" sign is brought into the El Paso County Coliseum ahead of President Donald Trump's visit, Feb. 11, 2019. Although Trump campaigned for the wall, both as a candidate on the 2016 trail and as president, no funding for his vision for the physical barrier has been approved by Congress, even during the first two years of his administration when Republicans controlled by the House and Senate.
The fencing in El Paso, and down river to Brownsville and the Lower Rio Grande Valley, is part of the initiative launched under the-President George W. Bush a dozen years ago.
Trump's insistence on wall funding was central to the record-setting partial shutdown of the federal government. But when a temporary agreement to reopen the government was reached, wall funding was not included.
And as administration and congressional leaders seek to reach a long-term deal by Feb. 15, Democratic leaders have said that wall funding will not be part of any border security package.",0
2487,"U.S. President Donald Trump repeated on Tuesday that immigration authorities would next week target migrants in the country illegally in large-scale arrests, but still gave no details about the planned action. “They’re going to start next week, and with people coming to our country, and they come in illegally - they have to go out,” he told reporters at the White House before a trip to Florida where he will formally launch his re-election campaign. Trump also praised Mexico for action he said it has taken to stem the flow of immigrants to the United States. Former officials and immigration experts said it would be unlikely for immigration authorities to move quickly to deport “millions” of people, but Trump’s tweet on Monday saying as much put cities around the country on high alert. Trump has made illegal immigration a centerpiece of his administration and is likely to highlight it in his campaign for the 2020 election, but so far he has not brought arrests and deportations up to levels seen in President Barack Obama’s first term as resources are stretched by an influx of migrants at the Mexico border. Trump is fighting the battle on two fronts, trying to stop migrants from coming in the first place and deporting those who have been released into the United States. In March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said arrests of immigrants in the interior of the United States dropped in the first quarter of the 2019 fiscal year, which began last October. New York City’s commissioner of immigrant affairs, Bitta Mostofi, said Trump’s comments are “part and parcel of an agenda that is seeking to instill fear in immigrant communities that is hurting our ability to advance our city’s interests.” Mostofi said New York has increased resources for immigrant legal defense programs to respond to increased enforcement actions. ICE said on Tuesday that it will continue to conduct “routine targeted enforcement operations” and referred questions about Trump’s tweets to the White House. Any increase in ICE arrests would require additional detention space for those arrested and processed before deportation. As of June 8, ICE had almost 53,141 people in adult detention centers, much higher than the levels for which it is funded by Congress, which would put logistical brakes on the possible scale of any operation. ICE’s dedicated family detention centers are currently operating below capacity, however, with a population of 1,662 as of June 17. Mexico has pledged to do more on illegal immigration, in order to stave of threatened U.S. tariffs on its goods. “Mexico has been doing a very good job the last four days. ... I appreciate the job they’re doing,” Trump said. “Guatemala, likewise is much different than it was under past administrations, so we’ll see how that works out,” he said. Vice President Mike Pence suggested last week that Guatemala could receive asylum seekers from its neighbors as a safe third country agreement, which might force asylum seekers from other Central American countries to seek refuge there before applying in the United States. Guatemala’s interior minister, Enrique Degenhart, on Tuesday said there was no such agreement yet. “We have not said we accept being a safe third country. ... We’re in discussions to find a measure that suits both countries,” Degenhart told reporters, saying he welcomed that the United States saw Guatemala as a “safe country.”",0
1478,"Nearly 51,000 undocumented immigrants were caught crossing the U.S. border with Mexico last month, the Trump administration said Friday. Among 50,975 people arrested, roughly 23,100 were traveling as families, according to arrest figures posted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The number of people traveling as families arrested last month—mostly from Central America, according to government arrest data—is a 38% increase compared to September. During the 12 months from October 2017 through September, or fiscal year 2018, more than 107,000 migrants traveling as families were arrested the border, a record for any fiscal year. Nearly all of those people have or are expected to ask for asylum in the United States, U.S. officials said. President Donald Trump has repeatedly described the increasing volume of families caught at the border as a crisis. He has said the impending arrival of multiple caravans of mostly Central American migrants making their way through Mexico bound for the U.S. border constitutes an “invasion” and last month ordered thousands of active-duty military troops, mostly Army soldiers, to the border to assist U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers and Border Patrol agents. Friday, Mr. Trump he signed a presidential proclamation that, combined with a new rule issued by the Justice and Homeland Security departments, will block immigrants caught crossing the border illegally from the asylum process. Critics has said the move oversteps his authority to change federal immigration laws. A lawsuit challenging the directive was filed Friday in Northern California. The effort is intended to push would-be asylum seekers to come to ports of entry along the Mexican border. Migrants seeking refuge at ports of entry have faced weeks long waits in Mexico as U.S. official have said there was no space inside the border crossings. Customs and Border Protection officials told reporters Friday that the agency was preparing for the arrival of the caravan. The officials said efforts to stop illegal border crossings and process caravan members who arrive at legal border crossings in a safe and orderly manner is a law-enforcement operation, though more than 5,700 military troops have been deployed to the border in Texas, Arizona and California. The soldiers are expected to provide support for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",0
2233,"President Trump isn't getting into the debate over whether travel restrictions from seven Muslim countries is a ""ban"" — after all, he has used the term himself.
""Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday. ""Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!""
Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN. Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country! — Donald J. Trump () February 1, 2017
The tweet came a morning after Trump unveiled Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch,
It also came as Trump aides push back on the notion that he is pursuing a ""Muslim ban,"" noting that his order is temporary and affects only seven countries.
Critics also note that many terrorists, including the 9/11 plotters, have come from countries not on the list.
Of course, Trump himself has used the ""b"" word, as in this Monday tweet:
If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the ""bad"" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad ""dudes"" out there! — Donald J. Trump () January 30, 2017",0
2390,"Donald Trump is entering the breach over presidential powers, and taking fellow Republicans with him.
Trump's late-breaking decision to declare a ""national emergency"" to help build his border wall comes over the objections of many congressional Republicans, and is perhaps the clearest sign yet of divisions within the GOP as it braces for the 2020 elections.
“I wish he wouldn’t have done it,” said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, echoing comments by GOP colleagues.
Republican misgivings about Trump's order range from the moderate Susan Collins of Maine – ""a mistake"" – to the more libertarian Rand Paul of Kentucky, who tweeted that ""extraconstitutional executive actions are wrong, no matter which party does them.""
For his part, Trump said congressional Republicans have moved too slowly on wall funding. Still, he predicted that most will stick with him as things move forward, even as he appeared to blame the Republicans for what he considered a lack of funding for border security.
""People that should've stepped up did not step up,"" Trump said during a White House announcement Friday.
While Trump acknowledged he will be sued over the emergency declaration – and the courts could block his plan to claw money from other budgets for his wall – Democrats plan to exploit Republican divisions in a political way.
Leaders of the Democratic-run House said they will likely try to pass a resolution of disapproval of Trump's declaration of a national emergency on the border. Congressional rules would force the Republican-led Senate to vote on the measure as well, putting Trump's nominal allies on the record.
""I know the Republicans have some unease about it, no matter what they say,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. In a tweet after the president's announcement, Pelosi said she and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ""call upon our Republican colleagues to join us to defend the Constitution.""
Several Republicans have voiced the concerns Pelosi has talked about: The idea that if Trump can declare a national emergency over a border wall, a future Democratic president can declare a national emergency on any number of his or her priorities, from gun control and climate change to opioids and immigration.
A vote on Trump's declaration would be another sign of how deep Republican divisions might run, and how they may play out between now and the next election in November 2020.
""I don’t think anyone knows,"" said Scott Jennings, an adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
If four Republican senators join all the Democrats, a resolution of disapproval could get through the Congress. Trump would likely veto such legislation, though congressional Democrats could then mount an effort to override the veto, keeping the dispute in the political spotlight.
Beyond Capitol Hill, some Republicans are urging GOP lawmakers to fight Trump. That group includes longtime critics who are contemplating primary runs against the incumbent president in 2020.
""The good news out of this unconstitutional power grab is it will split off some Republicans from this wannabe Franco,"" tweeted John Weaver, a political strategist for former Ohio governor and possible Trump challenger John Kasich.
Republican angst in Congress seems fueled by the fact that Trump's decision of a national emergency caught many of them by surprise.
Trump and his aides had stopped discussing the national security idea in recent days, after weeks of hearing objections from fellow Republicans. Instead, party members urged the president to sign a new spending bill designed to prevent another partial government shutdown, only three weeks after a record-setting 35-day shutdown that also gave Republicans heartburn.
Trump did not use the words ""national emergency"" during his high-profile political rally Monday night near the Mexico border in El Paso, Texas. Administration officials like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had played down the idea, talking instead about plans to divert money from other budgets to finance the wall without a formal emergency declaration.
Things changed Thursday afternoon, amid worries that Trump might veto a new spending bill because it contained less than a third of the wall money he had demanded.
McConnell, who had urged Trump to forgo the emergency declaration, suddenly took to the Senate floor to announce what sounded like a deal with Trump: He would sign the spending bill to keep the government open, while McConnell would back the declaration.
""He has indicated he is prepared to sign the bill,"" McConnell said. ""He will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time. I've indicated to him that I'm going to support the national emergency declaration.""
To be sure, many Republicans back Trump's emergency plan, calling it justified by the need for border security. They also cited Democratic opposition to the wall, noting that many members of the opposition don't want to spend any money at all on any kind of border barrier.
Others point out that the courts, probably the Supreme Court, will make the ultimate decision about whether Trump has the legal authority to take this kind of action.
If the courts block Trump's bid to declare a national emergency, that could potentially reduce Republican tensions.
If the courts back Trump, the nature of presidential relations with Congress will change, even between presidents and their parties.
There have been signs of friction before during the up-and-down relationship between Trump, the maverick businessman who had never run for office before 2016, and his adopted Republican Party.
Congressional Republicans have pushed back on concerns that Trump might try to remove special counsel Robert Mueller over the Russia investigation. They have criticized Trump for his decision to remove troops from Syria and his attacks on NATO.
Last week, hours before Trump delivered his State of the Union address, the Republican-controlled Senate approved legislation that included sharp criticism of Trump over planned withdrawals of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan.
For his part, Trump has blamed party members, particularly former House Speaker Paul Ryan, for their loss of the House during last year's elections, as well as other reversals.
Now come legal and political battles over national emergencies, even after Republicans had asked Trump not to take this step.
Some Republican analysts said the legal and political aspects of a unique situation make it hard to assess long-term impact.
Texas-based political consultant Matt Mackowiak said Pelosi's efforts to force a vote on the resolution ""may divide the Republicans somewhat.""

2358,"Every month, nearly 63 million people bring home a traditional Social Security benefit check.
By ""traditional,"" I mean as an eligible retired worker, a survivor of a deceased worker, or as a long-term disabled worker. Of these close to 63 million beneficiaries, an estimated 22.1 million are kept out of poverty as a direct result of their monthly check. Social Security is simply that important.
But what you may have overlooked is that far more people are covered by this program than you realize. In addition to making monthly payouts to tens of millions of beneficiaries, approximately 175 million workers and their immediate families are afforded protections by America's most important social program.
Income inequality: The rich keep getting richer, and that's not a good thing for Social Security
Forget early retirement: 3 reasons you might want to wait to file for Social Security
Data from the Social Security Administration (SSA) pegs long-term disability protection at 90 percent of the current workforce between ages of 21 and 64, while 96 percent of the workforce between 20 and 49 have survivors insurance protection in place for their spouse and/or young children.Not everyone will receive a Social Security benefit
Yet Social Security is still not an entitlement. Being an American citizen doesn't guarantee you'll qualify for these protections, or a retired worker benefit. Rather, it's a program that awards benefits through work. Earn 40 lifetime work credits, of which a maximum of four can be earned per year, and you'll guarantee yourself these protections and a retired worker benefit when you retire.
This, of course, means that some folks won't receive a retirement benefit from Social Security. Though more than nine out of 10 adults in this country will receive a Social Security retirement benefit, the following five groups will not.
1. Infrequent workers
One of the most common reasons to not receive a Social Security retired worker benefit is simply not hitting the required 40 lifetime work credits needed to earn one. Some folks drop out of the labor force and become full-time parents or perhaps caretakers for a sick parent or friend. Whatever the reason, not accruing enough work credits can disqualify someone from receiving a retirement benefit.
However, you should be aware that the bar for earning these credits is pretty low, with each credit working out to $1,360 in earned income in 2019. Thus, to max out your work credits for 2019, you'd only need $5,440 in earned income. Do this for 10 years, and you'd qualify for a Social Security retirement benefit.
2. Late-arriving legal immigrants
Legal immigration into the United States is a vital component in Social Security's success. Migrants into this country tend to be young, which means they're likely to spend decades in the workforce, contributing a portion of their earnings into the program via the payroll tax. In addition, by spending many years in the workforce, these legal migrants will earn themselves a Social Security benefit when they retire.
The same can't be said for late-arriving immigrants. Legal migrants in their 50s, 60s, or even older may not have the physical ability to work long enough to accrue the 40 lifetime credits needed to earn a retired worker benefit. This can leave older legal migrants in a precarious spot, since they may not have a source of income during retirement.

3. Undocumented immigrants
Despite what you might have heard, undocumented immigrants aren't eligible for a Social Security benefit. Period. What you might be thinking of is Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a program run by the SSA, but funded in a completely different way. SSI can be paid to asylum seekers, refugees, and people admitted for lawful permanent residence. But make no mistake – an SSI payment is not a traditional Social Security benefit.
Interestingly enough, though, undocumented workers do somewhat contribute to Social Security's well-being. Some undocumented immigrants will use a fake Social Security number (SSN) or a friend's SSN to receive pay, which will be hit with the payroll tax. A recent analysis from New American Economy found that undocumented workers paid $13.3 billion into Social Security in 2016, and these workers will never receive a dime of this money back.
4. Noncovered workers
There's also a group of Americans who've worked more than enough over their lifetime to reach the 40 required credits to receive a Social Security benefit, but who'll never receive a benefit as a result of their employment.
Noncovered employees, such as state and local government workers, typically have pension plans set up with their respective counties or states. This pension takes the place of the Social Security benefit they would have received had they been part of the 175 million covered employees. The SSA estimates that around 170,000 Americans aged 60 to 89 today don't receive a benefit today as a result of being noncovered workers.
5. Those who die before receiving benefits
Last, but not least, even workers who meet the required 40 lifetime work credits may not collect a Social Security benefit. That's because not everyone will make it to age 62, which is the earliest point at which benefits can begin for a retired worker. In some instances, workers might opt to claim at a later time than age 62 and simply pass away before collecting a penny from the program. This is ultimately the greatest unknown of claiming a Social Security benefit: We don't know our expiration date.
In sum, if you're collecting a Social Security benefit, understand that you're in the majority, but that it's also not a guarantee for everyone.

517,"An Arizona group that tracks deaths of migrants in the southern Arizona desert reports that 12 have died this year after crossing from Mexico. Officials discovered the bodies between January 2nd and February 27.
All of the migrants are unidentified as their remains had decomposed by the time of discovery. This makes determining the identity of the deceased, their nation of origin, and the time and manner of death difficult to determine, Pima County Medical Examiner Dr. Gregory Hess told OutletName Texas Monday.
“We have been experiencing this problem for a very long time,” Dr. Hess explained. “When the migrants decide to attempt to walk through the desert, there is not much margin for error. If something goes wrong, it can certainly be very dangerous.”
Hess said his county processes the remains of about 160 migrants per year. He confirmed the deaths of the 12 so far this year and explained they are continuing their attempts to identify them.
“The bodies that are left exposed to the elements can decompose very quickly,” the medical examiner explained. “In about a month, the birds and animals will leave behind skeletal remains.”
Art students are attempting to help in the identification of the remains found in southern Arizona, OutletName Texas reported in January.
Sculptors from the New York Academy of Art recently fashioned 3D facial reconstructions of eight men recovered after they died while illegally crossing the U.S. border with Mexico, the OutletName reported. The skulls are held in the Pima County, Arizona, medical examiner’s office because officials are unable to identify the victims.
In addition to sculptures, the art students are employing 3D technology to create images using information provided by medical examiners, including the estimated height, weight, sex, nationality, and ages of the missing migrants. Following the creation of the likeness of the deceased, photographs are taken and the information is sent to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs).
About 50 percent of the remains are discovered by Border Patrol agents during their routine patrols, Hess stated. “The remainder are discovered by hunters, hikers, ranchers, and ATV riders.”
Most of the deaths occur from exposure and lack of water. Hess said they occasionally find evidence of homicides caused by gunshot wounds or other violent trauma. Between Fiscal Years 2000 and 2017 a little more than 80 migrants died from gunshot wounds.
The 2016 Pima County Medical Examiner’s Annual Report reveals that the majority of migrants deaths occur between May and September.
Hess explained that his office provides services to Pima, Santa Cruz, Cochise, and Pinal Counties.
When asked about the impact of border security in migrant deaths Dr. Hess appeared rather neutral.
“Time will tell if this new push for border security will make a difference,” Hess responded. “Regardless of the administration in office, the deaths keep coming.”
Pima County Sheriff Mark Napier’s office is also impacted by the deaths of migrants and the subsequent recovery of their remains.
“Open borders policies are not compassionate public policy,” Sheriff Napier told OutletName Texas. “When we passively encourage illegal border crossing we are creating a human rights tragedy. These migrants are victimized repeatedly by bandits, human smuggling coyotes, and the harsh elements of this region.”
“Securing the border will prevent deaths and criminal victimization of border crossers,” Napier explained. “Securing the border is, in fact, compassionate public policy.”
Migrants deaths are not the only way that border crossers are victimized. “I hear from many sources that women expect to be sexually assaulted during the border crossing process,” the sheriff said. “They see it as part of the price they have to pay for admission.”
“We need to talk about border security in terms of not only national security but compassionate public policy,” Napier continued. “We should discuss ‘the wall’ as an analogous term referring to various aspects of border security that include manpower, physical barriers, technology, other resources.”

31,"Basketball Hall of Famer Rick Barry said Sunday the U.S. should be helping out those who served the country first before spending “billions of dollars on people who aren’t even supposed to be in this country.” Barry, during an appearance on  “Life, Liberty & Levin,” told host Mark Levin no one can justify a country that is borrowing money to give it away to countries where leaders are getting richer and are leaving out the people who are actually supposed to receive the help. “Then we spend billions of dollars on people who aren’t even supposed to be in this country,” Barry said. “And I know we were found on immigrants ... but the people came over here and did it the proper way and they took pride in being part of America.” Barry added that veterans need to be getting more help. ""The way we treat our military -- or the people who have helped to make this country what it is today -- is reprehensible that we have these guys living out in the streets,” he said. Barry added: “It really does bother me that they can sit around and supposedly be doing their job representing us but then vote on things and pass things for their benefit and not go ahead and ask us is it OK if we do this. They just do it on their own.” The 12-time All-Star also took issue with those who originally supported the U.S. building a wall along the border with Mexico and now are against it. Barry said politicians are against the wall because it’s President Trump who decided to go forth with a plan. “All of these people who are now against [building the wall]. Why? Because it's Donald Trump trying to get the wall built,” Barry said. “But when it was other people and other presidents trying to get the wall they were all for it. How conveniently they forgot the fact that they were for it. But now all of a sudden they're not for it. What changed?” Barry, who played in the NBA for the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets and in the ABA for the Oakland Oaks, Washington Capitols and New York Nets, is now focused on coaching in the Big3 Basketball League.

2623,"Democrats in the U.S. Congress on Wednesday were moving ahead with legislation to prevent the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, following a court decision this week blocking inclusion of such information.Representative Carolyn Maloney, a senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told reporters that she is re-introducing her bill, which was ignored by Republicans in 2017-2018 when they controlled the House of Representatives.
With the Democrats takeover of the House this year and the panel that oversees the decennial census, Maloney said she hoped that her “Census IDEA Act” would advance early in 2019.
Under Maloney’s legislation, the Commerce Department for the 2020 census and beyond could not insert any major new provisions or questions without first researching and testing them for at least three years. The changes would also have to be submitted to Congress for review.
On Tuesday, a federal judge invalidated the Trump administration’s move to include a citizenship question in the 2020 population count. The Justice Department is expected to appeal the ruling, with the case thought likely to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.
“Every person must be counted,” Maloney said. She added that she was gathering support from House members for a letter that would be sent to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, urging him to not seek an appeal of the court ruling.
Also on Wednesday, House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings told reporters that Ross will testify before his panel in early March. That hearing is expected to touch on several issues, including planning for the 2020 census.
Democrats and civil rights groups accused the administration of inserting a citizenship question onto the survey, for the first time since 1950, to discourage immigrants and Latinos from participating in the census.
The census, required by the U.S. Constitution, provides the basis for states’ representation in the House and their share of federal funds for an array of programs.
Democrats fear that the citizenship question would result in census data that over the next decade would mainly benefit Republicans in many congressional districts by undercounting minorities and immigrants.
Democratic Representative Jesus “Chuy” Carcia told reporters the citizenship question would likely discourage many “mixed status” families whose members have varying immigration or citizenship status from answering census questions.
Ross argued that the government needed citizenship data to help enforce election law.",0
120,"Mexican drug cartels and human traffickers are cashing in ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration by exploiting anxiety over his vow to build a border wall and crack down on illegal immigration – fueling the latest surge across the U.S.-Mexico line, according to local law enforcement.
The president-elect reiterated his pledge at a press conference Wednesday to build a ""wall"" – which he claims will curb illegal immigration, reduce gun violence and stop drugs from being smuggled into the country.
For now, however, the Obama administration's leniency, combined with concerns about Trump's crackdown, is seen as contributing to a spike in crossings from California to Texas.
“There’s definitely a percentage of folks who believed that they can beat the clock,” said Jose Villareal, chief of operations for the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector.
On a recent ride-along in south Texas, Cameron County Sheriff's Office Lt. Robert Rodriguez told OutletNameNews.com he has noted an increase in the flow of border crossers since Trump’s White House win.
“I can feel the anxiety,” Rodriguez said. “You can cut it with a knife.”
He said: “We see more and more people cross every day. ... The cartels are taking advantage of people being scared.”
Rodriguez patrols a patch of road that includes the most southern tip of Texas. He’s seen battered bodies float lifeless down the Rio Grande River and is no stranger to the sight of corpses – from babies to men in their 80s – littered along the land. Some were shot by drug lords, human traffickers and cartel members, while others were abandoned by their “coyotes” – paid guides to get them across the border.
He says moving people across the border is a high-stakes shell game that authorities at the local, state and federal level are losing.
Rodriguez, who says he's been in two shootouts, has seen people come over on foot and packed in passenger vehicles as well as ferried over the Rio Grande in rafts.
“This is ground zero of the problem,” Rodriguez said of the route known as Farm to Market Road 1419 in Cameron County. As for the human carnage he has witnessed, he said, “You’re a commodity. You’re a thing.”
And the traffickers who see border crossers this way are looking at boom times -- at least for now.
In November, U.S. Border Patrol apprehended 47,214 migrants along the southwest U.S. border – an increase of 44 percent compared with a year earlier. November was the Border Patrol’s busiest month since June 2014. In the past six months, agents have caught nearly a quarter-million migrants -- about 1,300 a day -- trying to cross illegally.
“Smugglers are telling them that they need to come across now while there’s a chance,” Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in Tucson, Ariz., recently told OutletName.
In response, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection dispatched 150 more agents to police the southwestern border. They also opened two temporary facilities to detain thousands of people trying to come over illegally.
""CBP is prepared to add housing, beds, toilets and bathing facilities as necessary,"" it said in a statement. ""CBP is addressing this migratory surge along the southwest border in a humane way, consistent with our border security mission and our American values.""
The border itself remains a challenge.
Of the 315 miles of border in the Rio Grande Valley, only 54 miles have a border fence. The sector, made up of 34,000 square miles of U.S. territory, accounts for more than half of the migrant apprehensions each year.
As the son of Mexican migrant workers who crossed the border illegally decades ago – they later became naturalized citizens – Rodriguez believes talk of the border wall is Washington window-dressing for a more complicated problem.
“Smugglers change their tactic all the time,” he said, adding that with a wall, people can go “underneath it, over it or around it.”
Most of the wall in Cameron County is 18 feet tall and made from rusty iron bars. In other parts, it’s fence. At a cost of more than $6 million per mile to build, the barrier runs through people’s backyards and farmers’ fields. There are gigantic gaps along the way -- stretches where the wall abruptly stops.
“There are actually openings in the wall,” Brownsville Mayor Tony Martinez told OutletNameNews.com. “I haven’t seen people go around the wall or over the wall. I’ve seen them go right through those openings.”
For some residents in the region, the rush of border crossers ahead of Trump taking office has bred fear.
One McAllen-area resident, who asked not to be named out of safety concerns for her young children, said she has seen a “big jump” in numbers.
“The area is enormous and there aren’t enough [authorities] out here,” she said. “We see people cross all the time. Could we say something? Should we? Of course, but what about our kids?”
Rodriguez says intimidation by cartel members is common and that scouts for coyotes and gangs are everywhere.
“One day, a resident complains and the next, there’s a blacked-out SUV in front of their house,” he said. “They get the message.”",1
663,"Ellis Island began processing immigrants into the U.S. on Jan. 1, 1892 — 127 years ago.
Fifteen-year-old Irish immigrant Annie Moore was the first to cross through the Ellis Island Immigration station, according to the Library of Congress. She would be one of more than 12 million people who would pass through the entry port in New York Harbor, which operated for 62 years.
About 2 percent of those who went to Ellis Island were denied entry, according to History.
Ellis Island was built to accommodate the nearly 600,000 immigrants who were coming to America in the late 1800s, FamilySearch reported. The Castle Garden Emigration Landing Port in New York, where many of the immigrants were processed prior to Ellis Island, could not handle the massive number of people coming into the U.S.
Those who successfully made it past inspection were able to exchange money and buy rail tickets on Ellis Island itself. The detained stayed in the dorms or a hospital on the island, according to FamilySearch.
Getting past the immigration port required having the proper documents and being in good health.
Immigrants also had to answer 29 questions on their personal information and U.S. history.
Many of the Ellis Island immigrants came from Europe. Eastern European Jews, specifically, migrated in an effort to flee religious persecution.
One of the myths about Ellis Island is that people with long, tricky-to-spell last names had to change them to make them easier to pronounce upon arrival. Name changes would normally occur prior to stepping foot on American soil when the ship’s cargo list was written in Europe, according to OutletName.
Ships could carry a wide range of passengers hoping for entry, from 1,000 to up to 10,000, according to History. The largest number of immigrants passing through in a day was 11,747 on April 17, 1907, Time reported.
Laws in 1921 and 1924 decreased immigration, with a steady decline of foreign-born U.S. residents until after the 1965 amendments to the Immigration and Naturalization Act went into effect, which included family reunification and refugee quotas, according to the Pew Research Center.
Former President Lyndon B. Johnson also declared Ellis Island as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, according to the Statue of Liberty — Ellis Island Foundation.",1
1275,"The share of U.S. workers born outside the country hit its highest level in decades in 2018, boosted by steady immigration and a drop in the native-born birthrate. Foreign-born workers—those not born in the U.S. nor having U.S. citizens as parents—accounted for 17.5% of all U.S. employees in 2018, up from 17.1% in 2017, the Labor Department said Thursday. The category includes people born abroad who are now U.S. citizens, immigrants and those in the U.S. temporarily. The data also showed that foreign-born workers are increasingly becoming better educated and more likely to be Asian. The share of workers from abroad has generally trended up in the past two decades amid slower growth of the native-born population, experts said. Last year’s level was the highest since records began in 1996. There were 27.2 million U.S. workers who were born outside the country last year, up 3.7% from a year earlier. That was an acceleration from 1.8% growth in 2017, and the fastest rate of foreign-born employment growth since 2012. Growth rates can be variable from year to year, but the trend in the past decade has been strong growth in foreign-born workers and little change for native born. The number of foreign people in the U.S. labor force—including workers and those seeking jobs—rose 17.2% over the decade ending in 2018. The native-born labor force increased by 2.8% in that time. “The top overall reason for people to come to the United States is for employment,” said Jeanne Batalova, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The data showed that foreign-born workers earned less than native-born Americans. Median weekly earnings for a foreign-born worker was $758 compared with $910 for a native-born workers. However, earnings for foreign-born workers rose at a faster rate last year. The earnings discrepancy in part reflects differences in education levels. Of the foreign-born labor force age 25 and older, 21.2% haven’t completed high school compared with 4.1% of native born. The share with the lowest level of education has trended down since in the late 1990s. Meanwhile, the share of foreign-born workers with college degrees has increased. Last year, 36.9% of the foreign-born labor force held a bachelor’s degree or higher, versus 41.4% of native born. President Trump on Thursday proposed a plan aimed at more closely connecting immigration visas to jobs, rather than being based on family ties or refugee admissions. The plan would seek to tilt immigration toward workers with extraordinary talent, sought-after specialized vocations and exceptional students. To some degree, that shift may be already occurring. Education levels are rising among immigrants due to a general increase in educational attainment around the world, Ms. Batalova said. And an increasing share of immigrants are coming to the U.S. from China and India, countries whose immigrants tend to have higher levels of education than those from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, she said. Thursday’s report showed Hispanics account for the largest portion of the foreign-born labor force, at 47.7%. The size of their share has shrunk some since topping 50% in 2009. Meanwhile, Asians account for more than a quarter of foreign-born labor force, up from 22.3% in 2009. The foreign-born category includes legally admitted immigrants, refugees, temporary workers, students and undocumented immigrants. The data doesn’t separately identify people in these categories. Data for people first arriving in the U.S. in 2018 isn’t yet available. Ms. Batalova said there has been no significant change in recent years in the number of green cards and worker visas issued, and such work permits are quickly taken up. She added the rate of illegal border crossings has slowed. Thursday’s report showed foreign-born people were more likely to work or seek work. In 2018, the labor-force participation rate of the foreign born was 65.7%, the Labor Department said. The participation rate for the native born was 62.3%. The average unemployment rate for foreign-born people was 3.5% in 2018, down from 4.1% in 2017. The jobless rate of native-born people was 4.0% in 2018, down from 4.4% in 2017. Foreign-born workers—and their children—are likely to become a larger part of the labor force in the coming years, said William Frey, a demographer at The Brookings Institution. His research shows the share of foreign-born people in the U.S. population has trended up since 1970, following immigration law changes in the 1960s. “They’ll have a lot to do with what we’re going to be as a country,” he said. “How productive we can be, how fast our economy can grow—and determine if we have the ability to support an aging native-born population.”",0
468,"The Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler fired off a “fact check” during President Donald Trump’s State of the Union speech, parsing whether migrant women were “sexually abused” or “assaulted” while traveling through Mexico to the United States with human traffickers.
In his remarks, the president appeared to cite a May 2017 report via Doctors Without Borders, which says: “1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.”
“Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate –it is cruel,” Trump began. “One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.”
“Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery,” he continued.
Kessler objected, saying DWB’s survey could be flawed because the organization did not conduct a random-sample survey. Rather, it spoke with 500 women who were treated by doctors — 12 percent who were reportedly women.

615,"The President of the United States exercises significant fiscal power in signing an executive order, and last year, President Trump signed more than any president in a quarter century.
What are the financial costs of the president’s immigration policies that are being implemented without review and approval from Congress? How shall we grade the president on his spending choices? Do his financial expenditures meet your expectations and budget priorities?
You should care about this. It is your money being spent.
Trump says we need to spend more to stop the MS-13 criminal gang from entering the United States, but he is shelling out billions of your hard-earned tax dollars targeting foreign national students, engineers, postdoctoral researchers, scientists, and entrepreneurs.
He is using your money to deport parents with U.S. citizen children and spouses, even if they have no criminal record; we are paying for it and failing to receive the return that was promised. The costs are staggering in taxpayer contributions, lost human capital and lost opportunity.
If you do nothing else, consider this when you vote:
In alignment with Trump’s policy of stepping up immigrant detentions, a record-smashing 13,000 children are now in federal custody (a fivefold increase over last year). Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reports it has cost upwards of $775 per bed each day to keep these children locked up.
Some may applaud the president’s effort to not let a single child be released until the fullest possible extent of misery has been doled out, but I say this is nuts.
Does HHS spending $458 million of your money in a year to pay a contractor to incarcerate children between the ages of six months and 17 years make any sense? Why is this a good thing for America? What is the benefit to our national security?
It gets worse.
Our president has decided to end Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands of Latinos and Haitians legally residing in the United States. He is using DACA recipients as pawns, threatening to deport millions of Dreamers if he does not get his wall.
The Immigrant Legal Resource Center at Harvard Law School found that deporting all Salvadoran, Honduran and Haitian TPS holders would cost taxpayers $3.1 billion, resulting in a $6.9 billion reduction to Social Security and Medicare contributions and lead to a $45.2 billion reduction in GDP over a decade.
The conservative CATO Institute estimates that ending DACA would cost our economy another $200 billion.
Disturbing? Consider this: in June, Trump stated that undocumented immigrants should be immediately returned “from where they came” with “no judges or court cases.” What? The Fifth Amendment states that “no person … shall be … deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.”
The Fourteenth Amendment grants to any person within the jurisdiction of the United States “the equal protection of the laws.”
Over the past six months, the president and his senior advisor Stephen Miller, who reportedly enjoyed watching children ripped from parents’ arms at the border, have intentionally violated the Constitution by deporting asylum seekers without a hearing; by separating families without due process; and by committing intentional infliction of emotional distress without providing equal protection of the laws.
Their strategy is backfiring, costing taxpayers millions as lawsuits are being filed to force President Trump to respect the Constitution, which he took an oath to do.
All of this doesn’t happen in a vacuum. The Trump administration just diverted $260 million from cancer research, HIV/AIDS prevention, and the Medicare and Medicaid programs to cover the costs of the president’s immigration agenda.
This must be part of Trump’s “fantastic,” “incredible,” “huge,” financial wisdom and decision-making, which he says are taking our country to new heights.
In reality, this is the kind of lip service a billionaire president pays to the everyday people who fund an immigration agenda grounded in mean-spiritedness, deception, and fiscal insanity — all to recruit and pacify the worst elements of our society.
So, if nothing else, think of your wallet when you vote.

2678,"The U.S. government reopened fully on Monday with about 800,000 federal workers returning after a 35-day shutdown triggered by President Trump’s demand for a border wall as lawmakers geared up for talks to avoid another standoff in three weeks.
The longest shutdown in U.S. history ended on Friday when President Donald Trump and Congress agreed to temporary government funding - without money for his wall - as effects of the shutdown intensified across the country.
Trump had demanded $5.7 billion toward building his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, which he says is necessary to stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and drug smuggling.
It remained to be seen how lawmakers address border security before the Feb. 15 deadline while avoiding another closure. A committee of lawmakers from both parties will try to negotiate a compromise on border security as Congress prepared to reconvene on Monday.
“There will have to be compromise,” U.S. Representative Dan Kildee, a member of the House Democratic leadership, told OutletName in an interview on Monday. He urged fellow lawmakers to ignore Trump’s wall rhetoric and “put our heads down and do our job.”
Trump has vowed to shut down the government again unless an acceptable border deal is reached and on Sunday expressed skepticism that such an agreement could be made.
He also left open the possibility of declaring a national emergency to get money for the wall, an extraordinary move that Democrats and some Republicans have vowed to fight and that would likely face a court challenge. Trump, who had initially said Mexico would finance the wall, did not address the government reopening or shutdown talks in a series of tweets on Monday morning.
Democrats, eager to capitalize on their political victory, oppose any money for a wall but say they back additional funding for security measures along the border, such as increased technology and more Border Patrol agents.
Republicans, who controlled both the Senate and the House when the shutdown began Dec. 22, are wary of a repeat closure. Polls show the public mostly blamed Trump and his party for the standoff.
Any agreement must win over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her fellow Democrats, who now control the House as well as enough Democrats to reach the 60-vote threshold for funding bills in the Republican-controlled Senate.Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan told OutletName she was open to a deal with money for strategic border fencing but not Trump’s wall.
Federal workers are expected to get paid this week for the five weeks of missed paychecks. Federal contractors and businesses that relied on federal workers’ business, however, face huge losses, although some lawmakers are pushing legislation to pay contractors back as well.
House Democrats plan to offer legislation to increase civil servants’ pay, Representative Don Beyer, whose Virginia district is home to many federal workers, tweeted on Monday. Some lawmakers are also examining ways to outlaw any future shutdowns, the OutletName reported over the weekend.",0
2585,"U.S. President Donald Trump will propose a compromise on immigration in an afternoon speech on Saturday, but not relent on his demand for funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, a source familiar with his plan said.
While maintaining his demand for $5.7 billion in wall funding, Trump will also offer backing for legislation to protect young immigrants known as “Dreamers,” as well as Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders, the source said, confirming a report by Axios.
Vice President Mike Pence, White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and a senior White House adviser, have been instrumental in crafting the deal, the source said.
Trump planned to make the announcement in a 3 p.m. EST speech from the White House.",0
2508,"Trump could pay for a southern border wall with a new 20 percent tax on goods from Mexico, the White House says, deepening a crisis after plans for a summit with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto fell apart. A Homeland Security official says U.S. Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan is being asked to step down as the agency moves toward tougher enforcement of immigration laws under the Trump administration. Trump's plan to end the ""catch and release"" policy - where illegal immigrants are caught, then freed pending hearings - could hit a wall, immigrant advocates warn The Department of Homeland Security is suspending trips by staff to interview refugees abroad as it prepares for a likely shakeup of refugee policy by Trump, sources say. Trump will push Republican lawmakers for swift action on his agenda, including funding the Mexican border wall, rewriting the tax code and repealing Obamacare, despite tensions over timetables and priorities. Trump is considering several more executive orders concerning national security that could be issued as early as Friday but has not yet made decisions on their scope or sequencing, the White House says.",0
749,"President Donald Trump mocked former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s support of an end to birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants by highlighting one of his past videos, in a Wednesday tweet.
Harry Reid, when he was sane, agreed with us on Birthright Citizenship!
Reid introduced the Immigration Stabilization Act in 1993, which would have revoked birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants. Reid stressed at the time that he intended to remove the “incentive for pregnant alien women to enter the United States illegally, often at risk to mother and child, for the purpose of acquiring citizenship for the child and accompanying federal financial benefits.”
Reid later retracted his support of an end to birthright citizenship and issued a statement criticizing Trump for including his name.
Harry Reid, undergoing cancer treatment, issues statement about his past “mistake” on birthright citizenship. “In 1993, around the time Donald Trump was gobbling up tax-free inheritance money from his wealthy father and driving several companies into bankruptcy, I made a mistake”
Trump told Axios Monday evening he will issue a future executive order to end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants and some other non-citizens, adding “it was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don’t.”
“We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States … with all of those benefits,” Trump continued. The president’s expected executive order is certain to spark a high stakes legal battle, which is likely to make it all the way to the Supreme Court.
Birthright citizenship stems from the 14th Amendment of the Constitution which states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”",1
38,"Amidst a border crisis that has morphed into a national security and a humanitarian crisis, leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination have all but endorsed open borders. During the first of the candidate debates, the Democrats expressed broad support for decriminalizing illegal immigration. The candidates also expressed unanimous opposition to removing any illegal immigrant who is not also a violent felon. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has taken the same position. With the possible exception of former Vice President Joe Biden (whose momentary hesitation will no doubt result in another abject apology in the near future), the Democratic presidential hopefuls committed to lavish social benefits for illegal immigrants, including publicly funded health care coverage. The first of many debates may have delighted the Democratic Party’s most animated supporters, but it is alarming many of the party’s more sober ones. In the space of just a few days, left-leaning journalists, constitutional scholars, and even President Obama’s Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson penned opinion pieces warning that the party’s increasingly radical stances on immigration pose – for them – a nightmare scenario: Donald Trump taking the oath of office again on Jan. 20, 2021. One might logically think that the reverse would also be true – that the Republican response to Democrats driving themselves off a cliff would be to help them do just that. The American public – particularly those who live in swing states and congressional districts that will determine not just control of the White House, but also Congress – is alarmed about what is happening at the border. Polls consistently show that immigration now tops the list of voter concerns and that there is strong support for securing the border, ending asylum abuse, and ending catch-and-release policies. Republicans are in control of the Senate, where bills that would do all of those things are teed up and ready to go. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., just needs to schedule a floor debate and a vote – something he has inexplicably refrained from doing. Getting this legislation over the 60-vote hurdle necessary to bring bills to the floor for a final vote is no easy task in the current hyperpartisan climate in Washington. But McConnell and the Republicans are in a no-lose situation. If they can peel away a handful of purple state Democrats, they can claim credit for addressing a top-of-the-mind concern for American voters. In essence, they would force their political rivals to make a difficult choice. Do they side with concerns of the vast majority of Americans, or do they side with radicals? Pelosi rules the House by virtue of some two-dozen members from ""purple"" districts. Many replaced Republican members by very slim margins. Do these freshmen Democrats really want to go into the next election having blocked asylum reform and border security, while having increased and improved detention facilities for families and minors? Do they want to do so with someone at the head of their party's ticket who calls for decriminalizing illegal immigration and giving everyone who shows up government-funded health insurance? The humanitarian crisis at the border is real. The volume of illegal border crossers is overwhelming the system and creating conditions that appall Americans across the political spectrum. Democrats, led by their most radical wing, have offered solutions that have little public support and are setting off alarm bells among thoughtful party stalwarts. By contrast, Republicans have solutions to the immigration crisis that do enjoy broad public support, and congressional leadership that refuses to play its strong hand. The ever-worsening immigration crisis dictates that it is time for congressional Republicans to move decisively on sensible border enforcement and asylum reform. Democrats have opened the door for them if they are willing to act on behalf of the American people and common sense.",1
819,"PolitiFact rated a claim that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S. born citizens as “Mostly True,” by merging illegal and legal immigrants into one group.
Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa claimed that “undocumented immigrants” commit fewer crimes than native-born citizens during a MSOutletName interview Monday. “That’s just a fact,” he said.
Politifact weighed in with a Thursday fact check: “We interpreted Villaraigosa’s statement to mean undocumented people commit crimes at a lower rate than the native born.”
One of the ways PolitiFact leads its audience to accept the “Mostly True” conclusion is by quickly switching from “undocumented immigrants” to simply “immigrants.” The fact check then uses studies regarding the crime rates of legal immigrants to argue that illegal immigrants commit less crime than U.S. citizens, a conflation that bears no strength in reality.
Attempting to establish a connection between legal immigrant’s crime rates and illegal immigrant crime rates is inaccurate and dishonest. A study from the National Academy of Sciences cited by Villaraigosa and analyzed by PolitiFact does not deal with illegal immigrant crime rates, but instead focuses on legal immigrants.
The fact check also cites a study from the American Immigration Council which does not “specify legal status” of the immigrants it analyzes. In an effort to demonstrate the crime rate of illegal immigrants compared to U.S. citizens, it seems pointless to again utilize data that includes said citizens with illegal immigrants.
To further support its rating, PolitiFact uses one of its fact checks from 2016 that also dealt with legal immigrants, a group Villaraigosa is not addressing. It is also worth noting that every illegal immigrant has already committed a crime, a fact for which the article fails to account.
The biggest problem with PolitiFact’s rating that “undocumented immigrants [are] less likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens” is “Mostly True” lies in the fact that we simply don’t have enough data on the issue — a point PolitiFact admits. “Researchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime,” the article notes.",1
599,"Democrats immediately rejected President Donald Trump’s offer of a work-permit amnesty for one million registered migrants in exchange for 230 miles of new border wall.
The rejection came even though Trump’s offer angered his base by trading a DACA temporary amnesty for a wall.
Also, Trump did not ask for the reform of the many catch-and-release rules which allow the cartels to profitably smuggle hundreds of thousands of poor migrants into the U.S. labor market, welfare rolls, and U.S. K-12 schools.
The speech came after Trump had offered a series of smaller concessions in closed-door negotiations since Christmas.
Democrats quickly dismissed the amnesty offer.
Sen. Chuck Schumer also rejected the compromise, saying, “offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking.”

My response to reported White House offer to end President Trump's government shutdown in exchange for the border wall and DACA: pic.twitter.com/WhsJgRNW56 — Senator Dick Durbin () January 19, 2019
Before the speech began, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement rejecting the deal:
Unfortunately, initial reports make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people’s lives. It is unlikely that any one of these provisions alone would pass the House, and taken together, they are a non-starter. For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.
In general, Democrats want to win permanent amnesty for at least 11 million illegals, block Trump’s border reforms, including his border wall, and ensure a steady inflow of migrants.
Trump coupled his offer with requests for popular improvements along the border, including extra money for surveillance and immigration judges. But he did not call for reforms of the current catch-and-release rules and instead suggested those vital reforms be postponed to another series of negotiations.
The Democrats rejected the deal even though pro-American reform groups slammed the work-permit-amnesty-for-wall offer as bad politics and bad policy
“A wall for amnesty is terrible idea,” said one immigration reformer.
The proposed swap is bad politics, he said. “A quarter of wall funding — only $5.7 billion — is an even worse deal. This would be an absolute betrayal of the GOP base who voted Trump into office. Trump needs to listen to the base, not [White House aides] on this issue.”
The proposed deal would allow Washington to pocket the amnesty while denying Trump his wall, he added. “You must swap statutory changes for statutory changes. There is a chance that the wall will never be built but the amnesty happens immediately and is irreversible. It is 1986 all over again – when the amnesty happened immediately and the reforms never happened.”
Trump has made 3-5 concessions in the border wall fight. But estb. media hides Democrats' refusal to offer anything in exchange. So Trump sees an incentive to escalate via a national emergency to get a wall. IOW, media's tilt skews DC political incentives ://t.co/cf9Qnr0tzf — Neil Munro () January 10, 2019
Overall, the proposed deal would create new political problems for Trump before 2020, he said. “There’s one thing that will cause another crisis — another amnesty. This whole thing started with the DACA magnet. The notion that we’re about to solve the problem with more of what caused the problems in the first place is ridiculous.”
“The offer the President announced today is a loser for the forgotten American workers who were central to his campaign promises,” said NumbersUSA.
Establishment reporters covering the dispute sympathetically portrayed the Democrats’ rejection:

887,"OutletName’s Jim Acosta believes he brought the “heat” to a Wednesday White House press briefing where he got slammed by Trump adviser Stephen Miller.
Acosta seemed to argue during the briefing that the poem on the Statue of Liberty requires that the United States can’t prioritize high-skilled immigrants.
“Aren’t you trying to change what it means to be an immigrant coming into this country if you’re telling them, you have to speak English when they get here?” Acosta asked.
Miller smacked down Acosta’s claim, responding, “it’s a requirement that to be naturalized you have to speak English, so the notion that speaking English wouldn’t be a part of immigration systems would be very ahistorical.”
However, according to Acosta, Stephen Miller just couldn’t handle the heat that Acosta was bringing to the briefing.
During a OutletName appearance Wednesday night, Acosta said, “We always welcome all kinds of people from all walks of life into this country, all people coming into this country have merit, they shouldn’t be subjected to a point system.”
“I was essentially just trying to test Stephen Miller on a couple of those points and I think what you saw unfold at the briefing was that he just couldn’t take that kind of heat and he exploded before our eyes,” Acosta concluded to the agreement of OutletName host Erin Burnett.
During the press briefing, Miller also called out Acosta for stereotyping immigrants when Acosta suggested that the English requirement would only allow immigrants from “Great Britain and Australia.”
“That you think only people from Great Britain or Australia would speak English is so insulting to millions of hardworking immigrants who do speak English from all over the world,” Miller asserted. “Jim, have you honestly never met an immigrant from another country who speaks English outside of Great Britain and Australia? Is that your personal experience?”",1
738,"The caravan making its way through various parts of Central America to the U.S. border has already swelled to around 14,000 people, according to a major Mexican newspaper. This staggering statistic, and even more conservative estimates, would render the mass of migrants larger than many American towns and communities, according to a review of U.S. census data.
El Universal claims to have received the 14,000 number from “municipal authorities, [southwestern Mexican city] Tapachula’s diocese, and the National Migration Institute.” According to The Daily Mail, the number includes up to 10,000 in the main Mexican caravan, 1,500-2,000 more in a second Guatemalan caravan, and an additional 2,500 “planning to mobilize” in Honduras and El Salvador. The Mexican National Migration Institute cited by El Universal did not respond to OutletName’s request for comment in time for publishing.
Reports conflict regarding the exact number of people who comprise what the Associated Press has described as “the biggest [migrant caravan] ever.” A U.N. spokesperson gave a more conservative estimate last week, claiming that there were 7,200 individuals in the caravan. The Mexican government claimed last Tuesday it was even smaller, at around 4,500 people.
Some Mexican sources claim that the caravan is dwindling, but other sources say it is growing as it moves through Guatemala and Mexico toward the U.S. border. But even if the smaller estimates are more accurate, the caravan could still rival many American small towns in size. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, there were 16,570 incorporated places in the U.S. with a population of under 10,000 people.
In a May 2018 press release, the U.S. Census Bureau wrote that “the United States is a nation of small towns,” and that “of the nation’s 325.7 million people, an estimated 205.0 million (62.9 percent) live within an incorporated place as of July 1, 2017.”
“Of approximately 19,500 incorporated places,” the release continued, “about 76 percent had fewer than 5,000 people and nearly 50 percent had fewer than 1,000 people.”
As the caravan pushes its way through Mexico, controversy surrounds its origins and how best to deal with it. Last week, Vice President Mike Pence claimed that Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández told him that the caravan is being funded by the government of Venezuela.
The L.A. Times reported that “Denis Omar Contera, an organizer with Pueblo Sin Fronteras [People Without Borders], which is helping the group,” reportedly “laughed off claims made by some Republicans that the caravan is being organized by Democrats or political opponents of the right-wing president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez.”
The “dream” of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, according to the group’s website, is “to build solidarity bridges among peoples and turndown [sic] border walls imposed by greed.”
Last week, President Donald Trump said “I am watching the Democrat Party-led (because they want Open Borders and existing weak laws) assault on our country by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people, INCLUDING MANY CRIMINALS, from entering Mexico to U.S…..”

467,"Border Patrol agents rescued a Mexican woman after she fell while illegally entering the U.S. with her boyfriend. The woman fractured her spine after dropping from a 20-foot cliff and was airlifted for treatment.
Border Patrol agents assigned to the El Centro Sector utilized the Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) to detect a man who had recently crossed the border illegally from Mexico into southern California. The man appeared to be trying to attract attention by waving his arms wildly, according to information obtained by OutletName Texas from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials.
Border Patrol agents located the man and learned his girlfriend, who illegally crossed the border with him from Mexico, had fallen down a 20-foot cliff. The agents quickly backtracked the man’s path and found the 22-year-old woman. She told the agents she injured her back in the fall.
Agents contacted local emergency medical responders to come to the woman’s assistance. The EMS team determined the woman needed to be transported via helicopter to a local hospital for treatment.
A REACH helicopter crew flew to the scene and provided transportation to a nearby trauma center.
Agents later learned that an MRI evaluation revealed the woman had suffered a fractured spine. She will require additional medical attention for her injury before she can be processed for removal.
The woman’s 44-year-old boyfriend is being processed for removal by immigration authorities.
The incident occurred when the woman fell from a 20-foot cliff near Ocotillo on Thursday night, officials stated.",1
