2485,"Reuters","Over two hours on June 1, a Honduran teenager named Tania pleaded with a U.S. official not to be returned to Mexico. Immigration authorities had allowed her mother and younger sisters into the United States two months earlier to pursue claims for asylum in U.S. immigration court. But they sent Tania back to Tijuana on her own, with no money and no place to stay. The 18-year-old said she told the U.S. official she had seen people on the streets of Tijuana linked to the Honduran gang that had terrorized her family. She explained that she did not feel safe there. After the interview, meant to assess her fear of return to Mexico, she hoped to be reunited with her family in California, she said. Instead, she was sent back to Mexico under a Trump administration policy called the “Migrant Protection Protocols”(MPP), which has forced more than 11,000 asylum seekers to wait on the Mexican side of the border for their U.S. court cases to be completed. That process can take months. Tania’s is not an unusual case. Once asylum seekers are ordered to wait in Mexico, their chances of getting that decision reversed on safety grounds - allowing them to wait out their proceedings in the United States - are exceedingly small, a OutletName analysis of U.S. immigration court data from the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) shows. Many migrants and their advocates say they are vulnerable to violence in Mexican border cities, which have some of the highest homicide rates in the world – facing dangers similar to those they fled in their home countries. Of the 8,718 migrants in the program OutletName identified in the EOIR data, only 106 – about 1% - had their cases transferred off the MPP court docket, allowing them to wait in the United States while their asylum claims are adjudicated. The analysis, which provides the first public accounting of who is in the MPP program and how it is being carried out, comes as the program is set to be dramatically expanded. On Friday, Mexico agreed to implement it across the entire southern border to prevent U.S. President Donald Trump from imposing across-the-board tariffs on Mexican goods. Trump, who ran for office on a platform of cracking down on illegal immigration, has grown increasingly frustrated by the ballooning numbers of mostly Central American families crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and asking for asylum in the United States. The administration devised the policy of returning asylum seekers to Mexico to reduce the number of migrants living in the United States while their cases chug through a backlogged court system. Kathryn Mattingly, an EOIR spokeswoman, referred questions on the policy to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). A DHS spokeswoman, who declined to be named, said the department could not comment on OutletName’ findings but said the program allows the United States “to more effectively assist legitimate asylum-seekers and individuals fleeing persecution.” Many Central American migrants choose to travel through Mexico en route to the United States, so “the great majority” are likely not persecuted there, the U.S. government has said in court filings. Immigrant rights groups have sued the administration to halt the policy. In April, a federal judge in California ruled it likely violated U.S. immigration law. In May, however, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the program to continue while the legal challenge proceeds. A HIGH BAR
Asylum seekers like Tania - who spoke on condition that only her first name be used because she feared for her safety inMexico – can at any time tell U.S. officials they fear returning to Mexico, according to U.S. guidelines. That triggers an interview intended to ensure they are not returned to danger, in violation of U.S. and international law. But the bar to pass these interviews is high: Migrants must prove they are “more likely than not” to face torture or persecution in Mexico. In the pending litigation against the Trump administration, one appeals court judge said migrants might not know they have the right to ask for an interview about their fear of waiting inMexico. But the government responded in a court filing that asking every migrant if they fear persecution in Mexico would likely produce false claims that “significantly slow down MPP processing and divert scarce resources.” Tania said that when she was separated from her family and first sent back to Mexico in April, she had no opportunity to express her fears. Instead, she said, she was put on a bus and driven across the border. It was only two months later, at her first hearing in immigration court, that she had the chance to tell a judge she was scared, she said. He then referred her to an interviewer. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the division of DHS that oversees the officers that conduct these interviews, declined to say how many migrants plead fear of returning to Mexico and how many are allowed into the United States, citing the litigation. Instead, OutletName analyzed EOIR data, which tracks every case registered with U.S. immigration courts and shows which are transferred off the MPP docket. When people are returned to Mexico they are given a notice to appear in immigration court, entering them in the system. OutletName could not track people who may have been removed from the MPP program before their cases were registered with the court. For reasons that are unclear, the total of 8,718 MPP cases registered by June 5 falls somewhat short of the number of migrants that Mexican officials said had been sent back by then. Immigration lawyers handling MPP cases in El Paso and SanDiego said the transfers are a good indication of how many people have been allowed in to wait in the United States, though they say some migrants likely were let in because they were pregnant, sick or otherwise deemed vulnerable - not because they passed a fear interview. CARTELS AND CRIME
So far, most MPP migrants have been returned to Tijuana and Juarez, Mexican cities with high murder rates, where gangs and drug cartels operate and migrants often are kidnapped or robbed, they and their advocates say. Returned migrants also say they struggle to find work, immigration lawyers and a permanent address where they can receive notice of their court hearings – circumstances that fall far short of persecution but can affect their cases or ability to continue waiting. At least 106 immigrants in the program have been ordered deported in absentia, meaning they did not show upto hearings, OutletName found. Authorities appear to have broad discretion in deciding who is placed in the MPP program. Tania was the only one in her family to be singled out. Her mother and younger sisters were allowed to wait in the United States, even as many other adults with children have been returned to Mexico. More than 3,000 of those returned to Mexico are children, OutletName found, including 107 babies less than one year old. DHS officials have said the policy would not apply to unaccompanied minors or Mexicans; however, the data shows 18Mexicans and one unaccompanied minor on the MPP court docket. The MPP program includes more than 4,200 Guatemalans, 3,000Hondurans and 1,300 Salvadorans along with a handful of migrants from Peru, Ecuador, and Nicaragua, according to the EOIR data. OutletName found the bulk of their individual asylum hearings have been set for this summer and fall, and a handful for later this year and early 2020. Tania’s individual hearing has yet to be scheduled.",0
1252,"WSJ","Hudson County, N.J., will soon whether to end its contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house detained immigrants in the county jail, one of a growing number of municipalities to consider severing ties with the agency amid pressure from activists. The choice hasn’t been an easy one for Hudson County Executive Thomas DeGise, a Democrat, who proposed the change last week. Without the contract, the county jail, the Hudson County Corrections and Rehabilitation Center, would have to go through painful layoffs, and immigration lawyers objected, saying it would move their clients further away. Mr. DeGise proposed phasing out the contract to house immigrants detained by ICE by 2020 at the latest, and believes the county can offset the loss of the money by offering addiction services to other municipalities and housing additional state inmates. The contract, which dates to the 1990s and is expected to bring in $12 million in 2018, was renewed in July by the county’s Board of Chosen Freeholders. “Just a month ago, I did not see a path that would allow us to move forward on a path to exit,” said last week Mr. DeGise, who faced pressure to end the contract from liberal activists, members of the clergy and fellow Democratic elected officials. “I’m pleased that after what I have heard from state and federal leaders, I believe we have a consensus on how Hudson County can exit the contract in a responsible manner.” The county’s Board of Chosen Freeholders was expected to vote Thursday on the proposal to wind down the jail’s contract with ICE, but officials pushed that back to October. The Trump administration has ramped up arrests of immigrants, many with no criminal backgrounds, in the country illegally, triggering criticism of the jail contracts. Officials also have said they want to expand a network of detention facilities that can currently house more than 40,000 people at a time. President Trump and other administration officials have said they want to keep immigrants facing deportation jailed until their cases are complete rather than releasing them ahead of their court hearings. An ICE spokeswoman said that canceled contracts can hurt the agency’s operations, adding that detainees and their families suffer the consequences too. “Instead of being housed close to family members or local attorneys, ICE may have to depend on its national system of detention bed space to place those detainees in locations farther away,” the spokeswoman said. Local governments around the country are coming under pressure to terminate similar contracts with the immigration enforcement agency. The mayor of Atlanta signed an executive order last week to permanently stop the city’s Department of Corrections from receiving ICE detainees. Sacramento County, Calif., and a suburb of Austin, Texas, also recently ended their relationships with ICE. However, officials in places from Kent County, Mich., to northern Oregon are resisting calls to cut ties with the immigration agency. Norcor, a jail that serves four Oregon counties, has a contract with ICE that brings about $850,000 annually, said Tom McCoy, chairman of the facility. “It’s a significant part of our budget. Canceling it would cause difficulties for the counties,” said Mr. McCoy, a Republican commissioner of Sherman County, one of the four counties that uses Norcor. Sheriff Lawrence Stelma, a Republican from Michigan’s Kent County, said his county jail received about $18,000 in 2017 from its contract with ICE. Sheriff Stelma said he has no plans to back out of the contract despite criticism from local immigration-rights groups. “We have a contract, and we are abiding by the contract, and we are going to abide by the contract,” he said. In Hudson County, the state’s fourth biggest that includes Jersey City and Hoboken, immigration lawyers pushed back on the possible change. A spokesman for Hudson County said the county chose to propose phasing out the contract rather than end it sooner, like some opponents wanted, because of concerns from immigration attorneys. Gregory Copeland, supervising attorney with the Legal Aid Society’s immigration law unit, said canceling the contract won’t release those who are detained by ICE in the jail and would only result in their detention in facilities even farther away. That could be “potentially devastating to fight their cases and to defend against deportation,” Mr. Copeland said.",0
2186,"USA Today","As the government shutdown stretched toward a month, the security and immigration controls that President Donald Trump says he's fighting to improve are instead starting to fracture as a result of the impasse.
In all, an estimated 800,000 federal employees from nine shuttered federal agencies, many charged with border and national security, have been furloughed or are working without pay. Lines at some airports lengthened as Transportation Security Administration agents failed to show for work. More than four in five Coast Guard employees stands watch without pay.
Nine in 10 of the 60,000 employees at Customs and Border Patrol must report to work, checking passports and manning the existing pieces of border wall. But they're not being paid. Immigration courts, as of Tuesday, had postponed more than 40,000 hearings, including many of the deportation cases Trump is trying to speed up.
Meanwhile, the impasse over Trump’s demand for $5.7 billion for a wall at the border and the Democrats’ refusal to fund it showed no sign of resolution in the longest-ever shutdown. From the high seas and airport terminals to desert border crossings and immigration courtrooms, concerns about security and those responsible for maintaining it continued to mount.
Border security could snap, all at once, in a matter of weeks without a resolution, said Robert Pape, political science professor and director of the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats.
Illegal border crossings have plummeted since 2006 due to increased manpower at agencies such as the Coast Guard, TSA and Border Patrol. Success will turn to crisis in weeks if the shutdown continues and pay for those personnel is withheld. Pape's warning from more than 10 years ago that terrorists could infiltrate the border could come to pass.
""We will go in reverse with the border security we have obtained since 2006 under Republican and Democratic administrations,"" Pape said.
Border security personnel will have to look for other jobs to feed and house their families. Credit cards will be maxed out.They will have to walk off their jobs.
""It’s going to happen all at once,"" Pape predicted. ""Tens of thousands of people.""
Workers strained on the job and at homeFor now, more than 44,000 of the Coast Guard's 50,000 employees must continue working without pay. Crews continued their missions, including the detention of 66 migrants trying to illegally enter Puerto Rico, according to the service.
Adm. Karl Schultz, the Coast Guard commandant, posted a Facebook message Sunday urging them to persevere despite the hardship.
“While our Coast Guard workforce is deployed, there are loved ones at home reviewing family finances, researching how to get support, and weighing childcare options – they are holding down the fort,” Schultz said. “Please know that we are doing everything we can to support and advocate for you while your loved one stands the watch. You have not, and will not, be forgotten.”
Terminal B at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston remained closed through Wednesday. There aren't enough blue-shirted Transportation Security Administration agents to staff them. Concourse G at Miami International Airport was closed throughout the weekend because there weren't enough TSA agents to man the security checkpoint there.In Atlanta on Jan. 2, a gun slipped through screening, although the TSA denied the breach was related to the shutdown. Elsewhere, airport managers urged passengers to allow for more time to pass through screening.The strain is showing up at agents' homes, too.
""I talked to a waitress in Bangor this morning whose husband works for TSA,"" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, tweeted Tuesday. ""They literally had to get a loan to pay their mortgage for this month. That's just wrong.""
Although TSA officials acknowledged longer-than-normal lines at some airports, the vast majority of airline passengers, 97 percent, passed through security screening in less than 15 minutes on Tuesday, according to the agency. Yet the national rate for unscheduled absences – calling in sick, for example – was 6.1 percent Tuesday compared with 3.7 percent on the same day a year ago.
Cairo D'Almeida, president of the union for TSA workers in Seattle, said Tuesday his members have turned to food banks and checking on eligibility for welfare as they continue to screen airport passengers without pay. He encouraged them to report to work, but said many will have to start looking for other jobs soon.
""Some of them won't have a choice,"" D'Ameida said.
Late Monday, the Pentagon announced that deployments of active-duty troops would continue at the southern border through September. There are about 2,300 active-duty troops at the border as part of the initial deployment Trump ordered in October to support Customs and Border Patrol agents.
'Immigration court ... shut down over immigration'
In the lobby of the San Antonio Immigration Courts building, migrants from Central America and Mexico mingled, processing the news that their court case was canceled due to a closed government. A notice taped next to the elevator said the third-floor courtrooms were closed until further notice and cases will be “reset for a further date after funding assumes.”
“If I had known this, I would have never left my house,” said Vianey Torres, 37, of Honduras, who traveled from Austin for her second asylum hearing. A friend drove her three hours through heavy traffic to try to make the early-morning hearing.
“I don’t have a car, I don’t drive, I don’t have a job,” Torres said. “Thankfully, I have friends.”
Trump’s demand for a border wall has spurned an unforeseen side effect: More than 90 percent of cases in immigration court are now indefinitely on hold, according to Ashley Tabaddor, one of the hundreds of furloughed immigration court judges and the president of the National Association of Immigration Judges.
“The irony is not lost on us that the immigration court is being shut down over immigration,” said Tabaddor, speaking in her role as president of the association.
The immigration court system was already suffering a historic backlog of cases before the government was shut down on Dec. 22. There are now more than 800,000 cases in line where immigrants are trying to fight off deportation, win asylum, and adjust their status, up from 542,000 just two years ago, according to the TRAC Immigration Project at Syracuse University.
The average national wait time for a case to be heard is nearly two years, up from 10 months in 1998, according to TRAC.
The Justice Department, which oversees all immigration judges, decided that it will only handle immigration cases during the shutdown where the defendant is being detained – less than 10 percent of all cases. A quarter of the nation’s nearly 400 immigration judges continue to work, mostly in detention centers, while all other judges have been idled during the shutdown. Thousands of hearings a day are being skipped. And with such a massive backlog, Tabaddor said it could be years before those cases are rescheduled.
Online graphic shows the trend in apprehensions at the southwest border of the U.S. since 2000. In San Antonio, which has some of the nation’s longest wait times, the shutdown is making a bad situation much worse, said Linda Brandmiller, a San Antonio immigration attorney.
Brandmiller said the shutdown will further entangle an immigration court system in San Antonio that was already struggling under 26,000 backlog cases.
“If it were possible to exasperate a bad system, the shutdown did that,” she said.
Jeremy McKinney, an immigration attorney in Greensboro, N.C., said the government shutdown has complicated cases for his clients and made life incredibly difficult for immigrants facing hearings.
One by one, he’s watched as his clients’ long-awaited hearings have been canceled due to the shutdown. They will likely be rescheduled for months or years down the road, meaning key witnesses will disappear, evidence will grow stale, and their ability to win asylum or adjust their status will diminish, McKinney said.
And with only one immigration court covering both the Carolinas, he said immigrants are traveling up to seven hours to Charlotte only to find out that immigration court is closed.
“If you have someone living in Raleigh, N.C., that person is driving about three hours to get there,” he said. “If that person lives in Charleston, S.C., they’re driving four hours.”
But, like Brandmiller, McKinney, treasurer of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said there’s an unexpected bright side to the shutdown: Immigrants facing deportation hearings are getting reprieves that may last for months or years.
“There are some people who are perfectly OK with this,” McKinney said. “I’m sure this administration is not thrilled to hear that, but the shutdown is actually providing a little breathing room for them.”
Late Wednesday, there was suggestion of a solution. And the shutdown clock continued to click.",0
2380,"USA Today","On a hot day in March, hours before then-presidential candidate Donald Trump was set to lead a campaign rally in a Phoenix suburb, Jacinta Gonzalez wrapped a U-shaped lock around her neck and pinned herself to a van blocking the road.
Gonzalez, 31 at the time, was among a group of about 100 migrant-rights protesters staging a civil-disobedience action. Members from Puente Human Rights Movement, an Arizona-based migrant rights group, and Mijente, a national social-justice activist coalition, said they were taking a stance against Trump’s rhetoric about Latinos and migrants. Their goal was to shut down the road.
The clash between immigrant-rights groups and Trump and other immigration hard-liners reached a head that afternoon in a spectacle that played out on news clips streaming scenes of protesters blocking the roadway and chanting: ""What do we want? Dump Trump"" and ""Get this clown out of our town.""
The town was Fountain Hills, a suburb patrolled by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, the agency led for decades by then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Long known for his immigration-enforcement tactics, Arpaio was at the time facing the scrutiny of a federal judge who said Arpaio and others had repeatedly disobeyed orders to stop policing tactics targeting Latinos that amounted to racial profiling.
Maricopa County Sheriff Paul Penzone said the county jails will no longer detain people flagged by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after the time the person otherwise would have been released.
Gonzalez, with the U-lock around her neck, was arrested that day along with other protesters. She was a U.S. citizen. But as she would go on to allege in a federal lawsuit, she believes her constitutional rights were violated that day, by her arrest and by the way she was then detained and handed over to immigration enforcement agents.
Nearly a year after that Fountain Hills anti-Trump rally, Gonzalez is talking about the day she was arrested. She believes her lawsuit is behind the new policy announced Friday night by recently elected Sheriff Paul Penzone.
Penzone, in a live-streamed press conference, said Maricopa County jails would no longer detain people flagged by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He said prisoners would no longer be held as a ""courtesy"" for ICE beyond their designated sentence for the offense they were charged with.
He said his office had been advised by officials with the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office that his office faced “threat of litigation” because of the detainment procedures used under his predecessor Arpaio. “There’s no further authority to detain an individual …” he said. “We are following our legal obligation to process that individual for release.”
Penzone did not specify what lawsuit triggered the changes. ​It was unclear Saturday how many people the change might impact, or how many inmates typically are on 48-hour holds in Maricopa County jails.
Saturday afternoon, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office released a brief statement on the change. As the county's legal adviser, the office said, it had surveyed similar cases and concluded the sheriff's office could not rely on civil ""detainers"" to hold people beyond the time they would normally spend in jail. The release, which did not quote County Attorney Bill Montgomery, cited a ruling in the case of Mercado vs. Dallas County, Texas. The statement did not mention Gonzalez's pending suit, which was filed in December.
But Gonzalez believes her experience at the downtown jail helped lead to Penzone's actions. Friday night, a couple of hours after Penzone's announcement and minutes before she took part in a press conference with migrant and civil-rights groups outside the sheriff's downtown jail, Gonzalez spoke with The Arizona Republic.
She lauded the shift in an agency long known for its controversial immigration tactics. She said she would continue fighting against deportations and to have ICE officials completely removed from the jail.

And she recalled the day she was arrested with two white protesters. Those two were later released, she said. She was detained for ICE officials overnight in solitary confinement at the Sheriff's Office's downtown jail.
""It was hard to be in solitary but it just made me realize that if I was treated that way — being light-skinned, speaking English and having a driver’s license — imagine what's happening to other folks who are going through that jail,"" she said.
Gonzalez believes her experience should stand as an example of how police and immigration officials will profile people based on the color of their skin or the sound of their last name.
Gonzalez said she chose to exercise her constitutional rights and stand up for undocumented migrants and other Latino citizens who are unfairly targeted. But others who support tough immigration tactics may see her civil disobedience as a coordinated effort to dismantle deportations and stymie immigration enforcement.
An activist's approach
In 2011, Gonzalez was a Soros Justice Fellowship. According to the fellowship bio, she was a lead organizer for the New Orleans Workers’ Center for Racial Justice Congress of Day Laborers. She wrote reports documenting inhumane conditions in a Louisiana immigration detention center and exposed abuse at the South Louisiana Correctional Center.
Gonzalez is a U.S. citizen ”born in Mexico to (a) Mexican citizen father and United States citizen mother,” according to federal court records. She earned a degree from Wesleyan University and studied at studied at the School of International Training in Durban, South Africa, and the Universidade Metropolitana in Caracas, Venezuela.
The pedigree and experience gave her a keen understanding of the law.
“I have done civil-rights work for over 10 years now, so I knew my constitutional rights,” she told The Republic on Friday.
Gonzalez said she had never been arrested before. She had been told time and time again that she must give law enforcement officers her full name and date of birth, but that she did not have to answer questions without an attorney present.
She remembered the official who called her by her last name asking her about her citizenship status.
“Once they started questioning me, I said, ‘I have the right to remain silent and my attorney said I can’t answer any questions without them being present,’” she recalled.
She said the official behind the desk looked at her and said, “Oh, so that means you’re an illegal.”
Gonzalez remembered saying, “I don’t think that’s how it works, but I want to talk with my attorney.”
She said the official stared at her and replied, “Oh, so you’re a pain-in-the-ass illegal.”
Gonzalez said the man told her that since she refused to answer his questions, he was going to place an immigration detainer on her. She said the officer had her Louisiana driver’s license in front of him while he questioned her.
Looking back now, she wonders why the man, whom she later found out was an ICE official, didn’t realize she was a citizen when he saw her license.
“In Louisiana,” she said, “you need proof of citizenship to have a Louisiana driver’s license.”
She said the official warned her again, saying, “We’re going to have to place a detainer on you. Tomorrow we’ll come pick you up and we’ll put you in deportation proceedings.”
ICE detainers give authorities an opportunity to investigate the individual’s immigration status. Gonzalez said she stared at the man and didn’t say a word.
“I was exercising my constitutional right to remain silent,” she said.
Those rights would later become the subject of the lawsuit, filed by local attorneys and others at the Chicago-based National Immigrant Justice Center. It named both Arpaio and Maricopa County as defendants, though it would follow Penzone once he took office. Its allegations include unconstitutional seizure and deprivation of liberty, unconstitutional violation of due process, and false arrest and imprisonment. The suit asks for an unspecified amount in damages.
Maricopa County spokesman Fields Moseley said in December that county officials were unable to comment on pending litigation. Penzone did not mention Gonzalez's case in his announcement Friday night.",0
1239,"WSJ","The Trump administration said Thursday that immigration judges may no longer administratively close cases, a way of letting someone avoid deportation, and released data showing that it is arresting far more illegal immigrants without criminal convictions than was true in the Obama administration. Together, the announcements show how the administration is rolling back Obama-era rules and policies that allowed for discretion in who is targeted for removal from the U.S. The first announcement from Attorney General Jeff Sessions said immigration judges don’t have the authority to administratively close cases and directed them to stop doing so. Administrative closures take deportation cases off the courts’ crowded docket and allow illegal immigrants to remain in the country even though they haven’t proven a legal right to do so. They have typically been used in cases where the immigrant has strong ties to the U.S. and no criminal record. Administrative closures were common under the Obama administration but have been much less so under the Trump administration, as prosecutors are no longer supporting the move. “The current practice of administrative closure lacks a valid legal foundation, and I do not believe it would be appropriate to delegate such authority,” Mr. Sessions wrote in a case before the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals that he assigned to himself to decide. In the second development, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency released data showing that one in three people arrested by ICE agents in the first half of fiscal 2018 had no criminal convictions, a result of the Trump administration’s wide net as it pursues illegal immigrants living in the U.S. During the final years of the Obama administration, in fiscal 2015 and 2016, more than 85% of people arrested by ICE had criminal convictions. But that share has fallen as the Trump administration targets a much wider group of people, the data showed. ICE priorities for arrest now include anyone charged or suspected of a crime, as well as those convicted. The agency also targets people who have deportation orders on their records. Beyond that, the agency has made clear that anybody living in the U.S. without authorization is subject to arrest and deportation. “If you’re in this country illegally…you should be uncomfortable. You should look over your shoulder. You need to be worried,” ICE’s acting director, Tom Homan, told a congressional committee last year. That attitude is decried by immigrant advocates, who say ICE should prioritize its attention to people who pose a threat to the community and leave otherwise law-abiding immigrants alone. But the approach is welcomed by many supporters of Mr. Trump, who favor a harder line on immigration enforcement. The new ICE data cover the first half of fiscal year 2018, which began on Oct. 1. In that period, nearly 80,000 people were arrested by ICE, about the same number in the second half of 2017. Of those, nearly 67% had criminal convictions and about 33% didn’t. Corey Price, ICE’s assistant director for enforcement, said that the agency is “still committed to focusing on those who are a risk to public safety.” But he said that all illegal immigrants had violated immigration law or rules by coming to the U.S. without permission or overstaying the terms of their legal visas. Of those arrested by ICE without convictions on their records, more than half had been charged with a crime. The total number of deportations, also known as removals, was down overall, to just over 117,000 in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared with just over 125,600 in the first half of fiscal year 2017. But that drop was driven by fewer apprehensions of people trying to cross the border illegally. Removals stemming from the Customs and Border Protection agency fell by about 20%. Removals of people stemming from ICE arrests in the interior of the country were up by 25%. In fiscal year 2016, the last full year of the Obama administration, ICE arrested 110,104 people, and 87% of them had criminal convictions. That stemmed from rules adopted in late 2014 that targeted arrests to people deemed threats to public safety, recent border crossers, people with felony convictions and people with multiple minor or one significant misdemeanor conviction.",0
2658,"Reuters","Racing against a midnight deadline, the U.S. Congress will try on Friday to send President Donald Trump legislation to keep the government operating and avoid federal agency shutdowns that would otherwise begin on Saturday.
The House of Representatives voted 230-197 on Thursday night for a bill to extend expiring funding through Feb. 16.
But with tempers frayed and Republicans and Democrats deeply divided over immigration legislation that has found its way into the government funding fight, the bill appeared to be on the verge of collapse in the Senate.
Without a replenishment of funds, federal agencies ranging from the Department of Agriculture, Health and Human Services and State Department to the Pentagon and Justice Department would have to curtail some activities and furlough workers.
Nearly four months into the 2018 fiscal year, the two parties still had not agreed on top-line spending for defense and non-defense programs, rendering impossible the passage of a long-term government funding bill.
Instead, Congress has been struggling to pass its fourth short-term appropriations measure.
Amid the deadlock, more senators were raising the possibility of merely approving enough new federal funds for a few days. The idea is to put pressure on negotiators to then cut deals on immigration, defense spending and non-defense funding by next week.
The immigration fight is over Democrats’ demand that 700,000 young undocumented immigrants be protected from deportation.
Given temporary legal status under a program started by former President Barack Obama, these “Dreamers,” as they are called, were brought into the United States, largely from Mexico and Central America, as children.
Many have been educated in the United States and know no other country.
In September, Trump announced he was ending the program and giving Congress until March 5 to come up with a legislative replacement.
Since then, however, the president has engaged in a series of spats with Congress. Trump and conservatives in Congress have used the Dreamer fight to try and win tough new immigration controls, including the president’s promised border wall.
Late on Thursday, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, who is leading the fight for the Dreamers, told reporters there had been some signs earlier in the day that talks with Republicans were taking a positive turn and a deal could be within reach.
But in a late-night speech on the Senate floor, Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accused Democrats of aiming to “hold the entire country hostage” by demanding immediate resolution of a “non-imminent problem” related to immigration.
McConnell continued to push for passage of the bill approved by the House so that a government shutdown can promptly be avoided.",0
2524,"Reuters","Three decades after fleeing civil war in his native El Salvador, Luis Munoz has built a life for himself in the New Jersey coastal town of Red Bank, working as a mechanic and raising three children with his wife.
Now Munoz and his adult kids may face deportation in 2019 along with around 200,000 other Salvadorans, after the Trump administration said on Monday they would no longer have legal protection under a program known as Temporary Protected Status (TPS).
“I cannot go back to my country,” Munoz, 58, said on Monday evening, sitting on the couch with his bichon frise dog, Hachi, in the apartment he shares with his wife, an immigrant from Belize.
Not only did he get death threats before he left El Salvador in the 1980s, he said, but current gang violence makes going back too dangerous and the ailing economy offers few opportunities.
Salvadoran families across the United States faced an anguished choice, with those like Munoz saying a return to their crime-ravaged country was not an option.
Many had feared an end to their protected status after the Trump administration cut TPS for Nicaraguans and Haitians as part of its broader push to tighten immigration laws.
TPS, which began in 1990, offers protection from deportation to immigrants already in the United States, including those who entered illegally, from countries affected by natural disasters, civil conflicts and other problems.
Salvadorans were admitted following a pair of destructive earthquakes in 2001. U.S. officials on Monday said TPS by definition was not intended to become permanent and that the unsafe conditions created by the earthquakes no longer exist. They said the protections would expire for Salvadorans in September 2019.
Many of the recipients were not affected by the earthquakes but took advantage of the program to gain legal status.
Ricardo Lemus, 38, crossed the Mexican border with his brother in 1997. As a legal immigrant under TPS, he has started his own hardwood flooring company in Rockland County, New York. He said he had put expansion plans on hold while he determined whether he would lose his business.
“I don’t have any options,” said Lemus, who has three American-born daughters and is not willing to take them to a country they have never known. “I‘m not sure yet what I can do.”
Elba Perlera, 47, came to the United States illegally in 1997. As a single mother, she intended to work for a few years in the United States to earn money and then return to her young son, whom she left with her mother.
But once she arrived, she said, it became more difficult to return. She found work as a janitor, got married and had another child.
Her son, now 22, made it to the United States at age 15 after gangs threatened him at his school and works in construction. Her U.S.-born 11-year-old daughter wrote a handwritten letter to lawmakers earlier this year pleading with them to protect TPS for the sake of her parents.
Both Perlera and her Salvadoran husband were granted TPS status in 2001, allowing them to get driver’s licenses, work permits and better jobs.“Now with this decision we could lose all that,” she said.
She hopes Congress passes a legislative solution and plans to make her case to lawmakers in Washington. She had no wish to return to El Salvador.
“Life there is not easy, and the government is not prepared to take people back,” she said.
Like Lemus and Perlera, Munoz was not an earthquake victim. At the time of the disasters, he was already in the United States, having entered from Belize legally on a tourist visa and then overstaying his time before applying to TPS.
His children, who were born in Belize and have TPS protection, have virtually no connection with the country they may soon be forced to repatriate to.
“Basically they would return to a world they do not know,” Munoz said.
Munoz fled El Salvador in the 1980s as a student, at a time when many of his classmates were arrested or killed by the army for suspected ties to leftist guerrillas. A day after a friend was killed, Munoz’s brother, who was in the army, called to warn him that he would be next.
“There are too many sad memories for me there - all my friends, my schoolmates were murdered just because they were young,” Munoz said. “They stopped the war but they were not able to establish peace or security. No one would say it is better off now.”",0
2560,"Reuters","U.S. Congress was set to reconvene on Wednesday with no sign of a workable plan to end a 12-day-old partial federal government shutdown and President Donald Trump not budging on his demand for $5 billion in border wall funding.The Senate and House of Representatives will meet briefly to mark the last day of the Republican-controlled 2017-2018 Congress.
When Democrats, led by presumptive House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, take over the House on Thursday, they plan to approve a two-part spending package meant to end the shutdown. But its prospects are grim in the Senate, where Republicans hold a majority.
The White House dismissed the legislation late on Tuesday.
“The Pelosi plan is a non-starter because it does not fund our homeland security or keep American families safe from human trafficking, drugs, and crime,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said.
Trump, a Republican, has invited the top Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress to the White House on Wednesday for what congressional sources described as a border security briefing.
Sanders said Trump remains committed to “an agreement that both reopens the government and keeps Americans safe.”
The spending legislation sets the stage for the first major battle of the new Congress between House Democrats led by Pelosi and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Trump triggered the shutdown, which started on Dec. 22, by insisting that $5 billion for funding of the border wall be part of any spending measure. He calls the wall crucial to curbing illegal immigration, echoing his 2016 presidential campaign rhetoric.
The Democrats’ two-part package includes a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8 and provide $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items including technology and cameras.
The second part of the package would fund federal agencies that are now unfunded, such as the Justice, Commerce and Transportation departments, through Sept. 30.
The House Democrats’ measure does not contain the $5 billion Trump wants. McConnell has said Senate Republicans will not approve a spending measure not supported by Trump.
“It’s simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the president that he won’t sign,” said McConnell spokesman Don Stewart.
The Democratic package could put Trump and his Republican allies in a tough position. If they reject funding bills for departments unconnected to border security, Republicans could be seen as holding those agencies and their roughly 800,000 affected workers hostage to Trump’s desire to build a wall that Democrats say would be ineffective and impractical.",0
530,"Breitbart","A liberal panelist at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Friday was booed down after claiming that “Mexicans who are coming across this border” are politically aligned with conservatives.
During the panel “The Trump Effect on American Politics,” left-wing radio host Rick Ungar attempted to justify illegal immigration, a weak U.S.-Mexico border, and amnesty for illegal aliens by saying Mexican illegal aliens held conservative viewpoints.
Ungar said:
Everybody always say Democrats want to do [amnesty] because we see millions of new voters coming to the Democratic Party, and I’ve got to tell you something, as somebody who lived in Mexico for seven years of my life, Mexicans who are coming across this border have so much more in common with conservatives that it’s not even a close call. They do. They do. [Emphasis added]
The CPAC panelist was quickly booed down by conservatives in the audience, who eventually started chanting “Build that wall!” the famous phrase often chanted at President Trump’s campaign rallies.
For the last few years, CPAC organizers have shunned pro-American immigration reformers from the conservative conference, despite polls showing that Republican voters see reducing illegal and legal immigration levels as the second biggest priority for the nation.
Instead, CPAC’s 2018 immigration panel included four men, three of which have ties and funding connections to the pro-mass immigration billionaires, the Koch brothers.

Ungar’s assertion that the massive waves of legal and illegal immigration over the past three to four decades, primarily from Central America, is turning out new Republican and conservative voters runs contrary to research by University of Maryland, College Park researcher James Gimpel.
In 2014, Gimpel’s research concluded with three major findings:
Immigrants, particularly Hispanics and Asians, have policy preferences when it comes to the size and scope of government that are more closely aligned with progressives than with conservatives. As a result, survey data show a two-to-one party identification with Democrats over Republicans.
By increasing income inequality and adding to the low-income population (e.g. immigrants and their minor children account for one-fourth of those in poverty and one-third of the uninsured) immigration likely makes all voters more supportive of redistributive policies championed by Democrats to support disadvantaged populations.
There is evidence that immigration may cause more Republican-oriented voters to move away from areas of high immigrant settlement leaving behind a more lopsided Democrat majority.
Democrats like former San Antonio, Texas mayor Julian Castro admit that mass immigration to the U.S. will result in Democrat dominance for generations in swing states.

As OutletName News reported, should current legal immigration levels remain the same for the next 20 years — wherein the U.S. admits more than one million legal immigrants a year — there will be about 15 million new foreign-born voters added to the U.S. electorate, more than enough to swing elections in favor for one political party over the other.
Every year, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from the process known as “chain migration,” whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.",1
2564,"Reuters","Federal police took steps to close a migrant shelter in Mexico’s city of Tijuana on Friday, sparking protests from some of the dozens of U.S.-bound people who had been staying there after traveling in a caravan from Central America.
The arrival of several thousand migrants in recent months, many fleeing poverty and violence in Honduras, has challenged Mexico’s new president to make good on pledges to protect migrants in Mexico, just as the United States makes it increasingly hard for them to cross the border.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who began his presidency last month, has yet to detail how he will improve what he has described as deplorable conditions for people trekking thousands of miles across Mexico to the U.S. border.
Officials in mid-December said that, of the nearly 6,000 migrants who had arrived in Tijuana in recent caravans, about half were at a large shelter in a former concert venue and another several hundred had dispersed to other shelters in the city, such as the one being closed. About 1,000 had crossed into the United States, while another 1,000 returned to their home countries.
Tijuana officials cited sanitary reasons for closing the shelter, a two-story warehouse in a zone known for crime and prostitution near the border.
The industrial site was overcrowded, poorly lit and lacked proper facilities for food preparation, said Isain Venegas, a supervisor in Mexico’s public health system. Common illnesses had been treated, he added.
Officials told migrants that they could move to the bigger shelter, run by the federal government, about 7 miles (11 km) from the border.
Many migrants protested, saying they did not expect other sites to be any better.
“Not one of the shelters in Tijuana has the conditions for them to keep us in ... the authorities are tricking us,” said Honduran migrant Reinerio Laine.
By mid-afternoon, several dozen migrants had refused to leave and were joined by U.S. activists, as federal and local police in riot gear took formation at the entrance.
Others packed belongings and set off on foot to nearby shelters, while several dozen waited for a bus that would bring them to the larger, government-run facility.
“We had hoped that now with President Lopez Obrador he could see the conditions we’re in. They said he was going to help, but they’ve treated us worse than animals,” said Maria Claros, 28, from Honduras.
“We don’t have anywhere to wash or do our business. I bathe with cold water when I have 20 pesos to pay for it,” she added.
For decades, Tijuana, a notoriously crime-ridden border city, has attracted migrants headed north. When Central Americans began arriving in large numbers in November, officials provided lodging at a sports center, but closed it after rains flooded the venue.
Last month, two boys from Honduras were killed outside a shelter for migrant youths.",0
2492,"Reuters","U.S. President Donald Trump presented a bill to his Cabinet on Tuesday aimed at boosting border security and overhauling the current immigration system to make it more merit-based, a senior administration official said. With U.S. lawmakers’ August recess looming, the official did not give a timetable for introducing the bill to Congress, but described it as laying out the president’s vision to rally Republicans around a detailed proposal. The president will meet with Republican congressional leaders Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy later on Tuesday to map out a way forward, the official added, requesting anonymity. “The goal of this has been to unify the Republicans as much as possible around a plan,” he said, noting that divisions with the GOP over policy issues had hindered immigration reform bids in the past. “We’ll see what leader McConnell and McCarthy want to do, if they want to put it for a vote. But at least the Democrats will know what the Republican unified position is,” the official said. The bill has 10 Republican Senate co-sponsors, he said. While the White House has discussed it with some Democrats, the person added, it was unclear if it would win the support of members of the Democratic Party, which controls the House of Representatives. Trump pledged to build a wall on the southern border with Mexico in his 2016 run for office, and has since fought with Congress and in the courts for funding to pay for the barrier. On Monday, he touted weekend raids aimed at immigrants who had been ordered deported, as his administration seeks to deter a surge in Central American families seeking asylum in the United States after fleeing poverty and gang violence in their home countries. The administration also said it would take steps to make it more difficult for immigrants arriving at the southern border to seek asylum in the United States, putting the onus on them to first ask for shelter in other countries. In May, White House officials laid out principles for the plan which they have been working on over the past seven months. The plan does not deal with the “Dreamer” children of immigrants in the country illegally or immigrants under Temporary Protected Status, both priorities of Democratic lawmakers. It does include a modified version of the so-called E-Verify program, which relies on a database that allows employers to electronically check the immigration status of potential employees. A merit-based system could upend the decades-old U.S. practice of giving priority to family-based immigration. About two-thirds of all people granted green cards for U.S. residency each year have family ties to people in the United States.",0
2668,"Reuters","U.S. President Trump said on Twitter Sunday that if the government shutdown stalemate continued, Republicans should fund the government by changing Senate rules - which currently require a super-majority for appropriations bills to pass.
“The Dems (Democrats) just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. If stalemate continues, Republicans should go to 51 percent (Nuclear Option) and vote on real, long term budget,” Trump wrote on Twitter.
Funding for federal agencies ran out Saturday with Trump and Republican lawmakers locked in a standoff with Democrats. Republicans, who have a slim Senate majority, said they would not negotiate on immigration until the government was reopened. Democrats say short-term spending legislation must include protections for young undocumented immigrants known as “Dreamers.”",0
2254,"USA Today","President Trump said he's learned that he can't always run the government like a business because millions of people are impacted by the decisions he makes as president.
""When you're a businessperson, you don't have to worry about your heart, the heart. You really do what's best for you — you know, for almost purely monetary reasons,"" Trump told a group of news anchors at the White House in advance of his State of the Union address Tuesday night.
Trump, a real estate mogul, campaigned in large part on his résumé as a businessman. Now that he's president, Trump said he has to put himself in the position of people who will be affected by his decisions on issues like immigration.
""I'm telling you, the immigration is so easy to solve if it was purely a business matter, but it's not. And I think that's something that I've learned maybe more than anything else. You have to govern with all of the instincts of a businessperson, but you have to add much more heart and soul into your decisions than you would ever have even thought of before,"" Trump said.
Trump's State of the Union address is expected to call for a bipartisan solution to immigration as Congress works toward a self-imposed Feb. 8 deadline to resolve the issue of so-called DREAMers. Last year, Trump revoked legal protections for those undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, asking Congress to decide their fate.
But Trump also wants $25 billion in border security funding, and an end to family-based ""chain"" migration and a diversity visa lottery system that he says could open the country's borders to terrorists.
Trump's unusually introspective remarks came during an off-the-record interview with news anchors, part of a State of the Union tradition. The White House later released a transcript of excerpts of that interview, putting the president's remarks on the record.
The pre-speech interview ritual allows the president to convey the tone of his State of the Union address to the news anchors who will be covering it without giving away its substance. In one exchange, Trump says he wants to use the speech to unite the country.
""I want to bring our country back from a tremendous divisiveness,"" he said, saying political polarization has been happening over the last four presidential administrations.
""You take a look at that impeachment of Bill Clinton,"" he said. ""During the impeachment of Bill Clinton was much worse than this. So many of you are too young to remember that. I feel too young to remember it, but I guess I'm not.""",0

Presidio County Sheriff Danny Dominguez told Odessa television KOSA that a grand jury indicted Michael Bryant and Walker Daugherty last week on charges of using deadly conduct by discharging firearms in the direction of others.
The charges stem from a Jan. 6 incident where police responding to call about a shooting on a ranch near Candelaria found Daugherty and another man in the hunting party, Edwin Roberts, with gunshot wounds. The men were part of a group of hunters and told authorities they were attacked by people who had illegally crossed the nearby border and tried to steal an RV some of the hunters were using.

220,"FoxNews","Nearly 200 people from Mexico and Central America were stuffed inside large trucks and caught trying to enter the United States illegally during three huge January smuggling busts that occurred in just nine days.
Officials in southern California said 77 people, including 5 children, were found near the Mexico border Monday packed inside a sweltering truck that had been painted to resemble a UPS truck.
The San Diego Union-Tribune reported a U.S. border patrol agent in Boulevard, Calif., noticed the truck was riding low and “could smell body odor mixed with a distinct type of pungent soap which is commonly used in Mexico.”
Inside the truck's cargo area, officials found people sweating and standing shoulder-to-shoulder.
A similar scene greeted authorities last week in Laredo, Texas, where border patrol agents found 76 immigrants, including 13 children, from Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala lying on the floor or crouching against the walls of a tractor-trailer rig.
A week earlier, also in Laredo, border agents stopped a tractor-trailer with 29 illegal immigrants from Mexico and Guatemala crossing into the U.S.
Laredo and southern California are home to two of the largest trade and transportation ports along the U.S.-Mexico border, and hundreds, if not thousands, of tractor-trailers move goods between the two countries.
Smugglers are taking advantage and carrying human cargo that can be easily transported across country lines without easy detection.
Jessica Vaughn, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, told OutletName on Thursday that these locations are funnels for an “enormous” volume of international trade, making them easy targets for smugglers.
“There is no way that all of them are screened [as closely as they should be],” she said, adding the financial incentive from smugglers and drivers is just too high to discard.
In the case out of Boulevard earlier this week, the driver was identified as Shawn Lee Seiler, a U.S. citizen who told authorities he was “an alien smuggler” who expected to get paid $100 per immigrant that he got across. According to court documents, Seiler was surprised to learn there were 77 people in the truck as he was only expecting 50.
“[This] is only a fraction of what the smugglers [who are putting them on the trucks] are getting,” Vaughn said. “It’s a couple thousand – I believe the going rate was around $3,000 a person.”
She continued: “The cartels that control the flow are making a huge amount of money...It’s a multi-million dollar business.”
Miguel Contreras, the special operations supervisor for U.S. Border Patrol in Laredo, told OutletName Thursday that the cost is more around $5,000 to $8,000 that people pay the criminal organizations from point of origin to point of destination.
All of the immigrants swept up during the three January busts were in good condition when they were found -- but this is not always the case.
Last July, 10 people died as they were being smuggled through Texas. Thirty-nine immigrants were found packed into a semitrailer in the parking lot of a San Antonio Walmart. Eight were already dead when officials opened the trailer's door and two more died at hospitals.
The truck's refrigeration system wasn't working and the day's temperature had climbed to 101 degrees.
The truck driver, identified as 60-year-old James Mathew Bradley Jr., of Clearwater, Fla., later pleaded guilty to conspiracy and to transporting immigrants resulting in death.
“These criminal organizations view these individuals as mere commodities without regard for their safety,” Gabriel Acosta, assistant chief patrol agent for the Laredo Border Patrol sector, said about the recent incidents. “The blatant disregard for human life will not be tolerated.”
It’s unclear how many tractor-trailers cross the border filled with human cargo and go undetected.
Contreras said they have seen an increase of tractor-trailer cases within the last few months. He said when spring hits, they expect to see an uptick.
In Laredo, border patrol are working to raise awareness among drivers that even though moving human cargo is “a quick buck” that there are consequences including jail time and losing their commercial driver’s license for life.
Vaughn believes law enforcement are seeing more immigrants crossing illegally into the U.S. in these conditions because it has become tougher to move in between the ports of entry. She said under the Trump administration, agents have shifted to patrolling the actual border, especially places where there is no actual border wall.
“We were missing a lot of people crossing the border,” she added.
The Trump administration’s hardline rhetoric and ongoing crackdown on illegal immigration does not appear to be deterring people from making the arduous trek across the southern border – mostly because the incentives awaiting them appear to outweigh the challenges or cost.
“They don’t know the details of the U.S. programs and the law; they just hear that there is going to be amnesty,” Vaughn said, adding that many believe they can work illegally once they make it to the U.S. “We have a moral duty to crackdown on this.”

Newton District Court Judge Shelley M. Richmond Joseph and the court officer, identified in court documents as Wesley MacGregor, face several charges stemming from an April 2, 2018 incident in which the pair allegedly helped Jose Medina-Perez get out of the courthouse via a back door in order to elude the ICE agent who sought Medina-Perez. “This case is about the rule of law. The allegations in today’s indictment involve obstruction by a sitting judge, that is intentional interference with the enforcement of federal law, and that is a crime,"" U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Andrew Lelling said Thursday. Joseph and MacGregor were both charged with obstruction of justice, aiding and abetting; obstruction of a federal proceeding, aiding and abetting and conspiracy to obstruct justice, Lelling said. MacGregor was also charged with perjury before a federal grand jury. Joseph, who has been suspended without pay, and MacGregor appeared in court Thursday and pleaded not guilty to all counts.  No date has been set for their next court appearance. ""As public servants, all of the officers in the court make a promise — a promise to serve the people’s interest above all else. Today we know this promise has been broken,” said Peter Fitzhugh, special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigations in Boston, who led the investigation. Medina-Perez, a twice-deported illegal immigrant with a fugitive warrant for drunken driving in Pennsylvania, had been in Joseph's courtroom in order to be arraigned on drug charges, the Boston Globe previously reported. Medina-Perez was the subject of an ICE detainer -- a written request to hold an individual wanted for deportation for up to 48 hours -- and an ICE agent was waiting in the lobby of the courthouse to detain Medina-Perez after the arraignment, officials said. But during the hearing, Joseph asked Medina-Perez’s attorney “ICE is going to get him?,” according to courtroom recordings obtained by the Boston Globe in December and released in court documents Thursday. Medina-Perez's lawyer was also heard telling Joseph “ICE will pick him up if he walks out the front door. But I think the best thing for us to do is clear the fugitive issue and release him on a personal, and hope that he can avoid ICE...That's the best I can do.” “What if we detain him?"" the judge asked before requesting the clerk to turn off the courtroom’s audio recorder, leaving nearly a minute unrecorded.

(AP) Minutes later, Medina-Perez's attorney said his client ""has some property downstairs"" and needed to speak to an interpreter, which Joseph allowed. MacGregor then used his security access card to escort Medina-Perez out of the courthouse without being seen by the ICE agent, officials said. ""With the recorder off, defendant Joseph and the Defense Attorney discussed devising a way to have A.S. [Medina-Perez] avoid being arrested by the ICE officer,"" court documents stated. The ICE agent continued to wait in the lobby not knowing the illegal immigrant already left the building, Lelling said, adding Joseph lied about the incident to her superiors when asked about it. ""The people of this country deserve nothing less than to know that their appointed and elected representatives are working on their behalf, while adhering to and enforcing the rule of law, not a personal agenda,"" Fitzhugh said. ""The special agents of Homeland Security Investigations remain committed to upholding our promise to the public, without compromise.” Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement the indictment ""is a radical and politically-motivated attack on our state and the independence of our courts."" ""It is a bedrock principle of our constitutional system that federal prosecutors should not recklessly interfere with the operation of state courts and their administration of justice,"" she continued. ""This matter could have been appropriately handled by the Commission on Judicial Conduct and the Trial Court. I am deeply disappointed by U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling’s misuse of prosecutorial resources and the chilling effect his actions will have.” Joseph was appointed Newton District judge by Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker in 2017 after several years serving as a criminal defense attorney and a prosecutor, the Boston Globe reported. After reports of Joseph’s alleged intervention emerged in December, Baker told reporters he believed Joseph should be benched while the incident was investigated. ""I don't believe she should be hearing criminal cases until that federal case is resolved,"" Baker said about Joseph. ""Look, judges are not supposed to be in the business of obstructing justice. And as far as I can tell, based on the facts as they were presented, she clearly violated the court's own policies with respect to the way they're supposed to handle continuance and involve federal immigration enforcement."" Medina-Perez’s freedom was short-lived. He was arrested a month later after the court hearing and again let go, this time by an immigration judge who freed him on bond, the Boston Globe reported.

We were wrapping up a two-day tour of the border by getting a bird's-eye view of the thousands of cars and tractor-trailers carrying freight that enter America every day through this busy port.
It was a chance to see multiple elements of an effective border security plan – walls, roads and infrastructure, cameras and sensors -- and most importantly, highly trained and professional Border Patrol agents.
While we stood there, the cameras and sensors detected a man pushing concertina wire away from the slatted fence, so he could climb the barrier and slide down on the American side. He then raced into the brush at the bottom of the bluff on which we were standing. Shortly after, he hid. Two Border Patrol trucks raced up and agents rushed out. They found his hiding place and took him into custody.

In this case, a single illegal immigrant was apprehended because all the elements of border security were present. But what about the thousands of acres and miles where there is no wall to slow illegal crossings? What about the ravines and valleys that do not have camera or sensor coverage? And, most importantly, even if there is technology assisting in detection and surveillance, how do we capture illegal immigrants when our Border Patrol doesn’t have roads to drive on, radios for communication, and must patrol thousands of square miles with only a handful of agents?
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., insists that building a border wall is “immoral.” I wonder when she last visited the border, spoke with agents, or conversed with families who live and work along it. Has she seen and heard the stories of the victims of the criminal violence that comes across the border, or counted the tens of thousands of people who have been harmed by the scourge of illegal drug and human trafficking?
Tons of drugs have been seized at ports of entry and even between the ports, and no one knows how many more tons are not interdicted. Approximately 40 percent of the drugs seized on our borders come through the Tucson sector. Again, that’s just what we catch.
We don’t know what we don’t know. That’s what’s important in this debate. What we know is devastating enough.
Death and addiction costs related to illegal drugs are backbreaking to this country. We have victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants. The frontier is rugged and exacts a physical toll, resulting in the deaths of many trying to enter the country illegally. Drug and human smugglers commit crimes against their human cargo with impunity, creating a humanitarian crisis. Environmentalists should be concerned by the ecological damage being inflicted by border crossers. Economic damage includes suppression of wages and technological innovation resulting from cheap labor.
We simply do not know the full extent of all of the problems caused and exacerbated by illegal immigrants, regardless of whether their motive to enter is malevolent or benign.
What we can be certain of is that as long as there are incentives to enter and stay illegally in this country, people will continue to flood our borders.
When my congressional colleagues and I stood on the bluff overlooking the Mariposa Port of Entry, and witnessed the apprehension of the illegal immigrant, we saw what a fully funded and functioning border security strategy might look like. The foundational element is to slow down illegal entrants. You do that by building a wall.
As Mary Ann Mendoza, an Angel mother whose son was killed by an illegal immigrant, said, “A wall won’t stop everyone, but no wall won’t stop anyone.”

2161,"USA Today","The Senate's Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, is taking back his offer to President Trump to fund his ""big beautiful wall.""
""The wall offer is off the table,"" Schumer told reporters on Tuesday. ""That was part of a package"" that's now defunct.
Schumer first made the offer on Friday during a meeting with Trump at the White House, part of negotiations to avert a government shutdown. Schumer said he put Trump's “signature campaign issue on the table in exchange"" for legal protections DREAMers, young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children.
""It was the first thing the president and I talked about,"" Schumer said Tuesday. ""The thought was we could come to an agreement that afternoon, the president would announce his support, and then the Senate and the House would get it done and it would be on the president's desk. He didn’t do that, so we’re going to have to start on a new basis.""
The White House has given a different account of Friday's meeting, saying Schumer offered legislative approval for the wall but not actual funding.
After the Trump-Schumer talks stalled, the Senate blocked a short-term spending bill, sparking a partial government shutdown. Senate Democrats voted against the measure because it did not include protections for the DREAMers, who now have temporary legal status under an Obama-era program called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
Trump said in September he would kill the DACA program but gave Congress six months to find a solution.
The shutdown lasted through Monday evening when Congress approved a new short-term spending bill that will expire on Feb. 8. Most Senate Democrats voted for that bill after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., promised he would bring immigration legislation to the Senate floor if Congress had not reached an agreement on the DACA recipients by the time the spending bill runs out.",0
100,"FoxNews","Defense Secretary Jim Mattis defended the use of active duty troops on the U.S.-Mexican border, saying that in some ways it provides good training for war. He argued that it's analogous to a 1916 deployment to counter the Mexican revolutionary Gen. Francisco ""Pancho"" Villa.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday on his way to visit U.S. troops along the border in south Texas, Mattis declined to provide an estimate of how much the mission will cost. He said cost figures he has received thus far are ""not anywhere near right."" He added that he believes that ""very quickly we'll know the real cost. So we'll keep you posted as the real costs come in.""
In his most extensive remarks about the hastily arranged border mission, Mattis argued that it fits an historical pattern dating to early in the 20th century. He noted that President Woodrow Wilson deployed tens of thousands of National Guard and active duty troops to the border in 1916 in response to a Mexican military raid into the U.S.
""That's over a century ago, and the threat then was Pancho Villa's troops — revolutionary raiding across the border into the United States,"" he said. He noted that more recently, National Guard troops were used in border missions ordered by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, although not on the cusp of a midterm election.
The Pentagon chief said that within a week to 10 days the 5,800 troops currently deployed for the border mission will have accomplished all the tasks initially requested by Customs and Border Protection, although additional tasks are now being worked out between the Pentagon and the Department of Homeland Security. Mattis did not say how soon the mission might end; current deployments are scheduled to last until Dec. 15, but that could change.
In addition to the 5,800 active duty troops in the border area, about 2,100 National Guard troops have been providing border support since April.
Critics have questioned the wisdom of using the military on the border where there is no discernible security threat, although President Donald Trump has said that a caravan of Central American migrants traveling northward through Mexico amounts to an ""invasion."" Since the election, Trump has said little about the matter, and no border threat has yet materialized.
Asked whether he believes there is a security threat at the border that justifies the use of the active duty military, Mattis said he defers to the judgment of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who joined him at the border Wednesday.
Nielsen and Mattis spoke with senior U.S. commanders and addressed rank-and-file troops. Mattis told the troops their mission is to ""back up"" Customs and Border Protection. ""Right now that's our role and that's all our role is,"" he said.
""The eyes of the world right now — certainly all of the Americans — are on you,"" Mattis told the soldiers, adding that they are part of a ""non-traditional"" mission. ""We're here because of the number of illegals who say they are going to illegally try to cross into our country,"" he said, apparently referring to the several thousand migrants moving north through Mexico.
One soldier asked Mattis what are the short- and long-term plans for the military mission.
Mattis said the short-term objective is to get sufficient numbers of wire and other barriers in place along the border as requested by Customs and Border Protection. The longer-term objective, he said, is ""somewhat to be determined.""
""When you're in something like this,"" Mattis said, ""it's dynamic, it's unpredictable. We'll have to see.""
In an interview with reporters traveling with him to Texas, Mattis took issue with assertions by critics that the deployment undertaken shortly before the Nov. 6 midterm elections was costing the military in preparedness for combat. He said military officers have told him that the deployment has been ""very good training"" because it amounts to a rehearsal for the kind of logistical demands — such as loading aircraft — that must be met in wartime.
""In terms of readiness, it's actually, I believe, so far improving our readiness for deployments,"" he said.
Mattis said the mission, which does not include performing law enforcement tasks, was reviewed by Department of Justice lawyers and deemed a legal undertaking. ""It's obviously a moral and ethical mission to support our border patrolmen,"" he said.",1
154,"FoxNews","Being deported to an El Salvador he hadn't seen in more than three decades was a trauma Hugo Castro recalls clearly.
The 51-year-old said Monday that his country must begin preparing now to receive the nearly 200,000 Salvadorans who may have to return following the Trump administration's decision to lift their temporary protected status next year.
""The main problem for deportees is that they're made invisible. They're rejected, there's no work. They don't help us,"" said Castro, who was deported from the U.S. in 2015.
The U.S. announcement brought fears that a major source of income for this poor Central American nation will be cut off and that families could be separated. But there was also a hint of optimism that Salvadorans with many years of experience in the U.S. could bring expertise and investment to spur the economy.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Salvadorans who have stayed in the U.S. with temporary protected status — only a fraction of the estimated 2 million Salvadorans living there — would have to leave by Sept. 9, 2019, unless Congress came up with a solution allowing them to stay.
The temporary protected status program has been offered to citizens from a number of countries fleeing natural disasters or other instability. The affected Salvadorans received the status after earthquakes in 2001 killed more than 1,000 people. Thousands more who arrived in the United States in recent years fleeing gang violence were not eligible.
Castro went to the United States as a teenager to study at a college in Atlanta. During his junior year his family back home lost nearly everything when the bank seized their coffee operation. Dropping out, he worked at a country club and a book store and became manager of a Mexican restaurant. Then a run-in with police led to more than two years in immigration detention as he unsuccessfully fought deportation after living in the U.S. for three decades.
His first three months back in El Salvador were the worst, he said. He suffered from depression and didn't want to leave his mother's home. People told him a 49-year-old man should not depend on his mother to support him, so he started looking for work.
""I went everywhere, to restaurants. I told them I had a lot of experience and that I spoke English, but they rejected me,"" he said.
Eight months after arriving, Castro finally found work at the Salvadoran Immigrant Institute. The non-profit group recognized the value of Castro's bilingualism and the experience he had gained through the deportation process and it put him to work helping other deportees reintegrate into society.
Castro said programs like his are very limited and more needs to be done for returnees.
""The government has to get ready, partner with businesses, with all of society, the nonprofits and create assistance programs,"" he said.
As an example, he noted that in 2016, the country received 52,000 deportees from the United States and Mexico. Meanwhile, a government program to give small cash grants to allow deportees to open their own businesses has only graduated 140 people, he said.
The biggest worry among many Salvadorans is that their nation of 6.2 million people will see a big drop in the amount of cash sent home by countrymen working in the United States. Salvadorans transferred more than $4.5 billion from the U.S. in 2016, accounting for 17 percent of El Salvador's economy, according to government figures.
Luis Membreno, an economic analyst in El Salvador, said that fear may be overblown. He said Salvadorans who have protected status in the U.S. tend to be more long-standing migrants who have their families there and send less money home. Many more Salvadorans are not in the program, with growing numbers entering the U.S. illegally over the past decade fleeing violence and poverty.
""I don't think that family remittances are going to fall in the short term,"" Membreno said.
He also thinks some Salvadoran families in the U.S. could start sending more money back — something that started when Donald Trump was elected president — so remittance figures could rise.
In addition, he said, many of those eventually returning could be skilled and have money to invest. ""All of this could generate a certain dynamism in the economy,"" he said.
Cesar Rios, director of the nonprofit group where Castro works, is less optimistic. ""Our country is not prepared to receive thousands of Salvadorans,"" he said.
Deportees are often targeted by gangs, because they believe they have money. Police also target them, because of the stigma that they are criminals.
""There's no work,"" Rios said. ""Between 200 and 300 Salvadorans continue leaving every day for the United States.""
Ernesto Godoy, standing outside a Western Union money transfer office in San Salvador, said he receives money from relatives with protected status in the United States. He worried the decision could lead to bigger problems in El Salvador.
""It's going to affect us, not only me, but on a national level, because here in El Salvador we make ends meet with remittances from the United States,"" Godoy said.

814,"Daily Caller","Los Angeles County paid illegal immigrant families over $1.3 billion dollars from 2015 to 2016, OutletName reports.
The metric is over a quarter of the money the county has spent on its entire low-income population. The Department of Public Social Services, the entity that assesses welfare and food stamp benefits in the county, gave a summary of costs associated with the city’s lax sanctuary policies for illegal immigrants.
According to a study from the Migration Policy Institute, Los Angeles has one of the highest concentration of undocumented people of any county in the country. It also permits undocumented families with children born in the U.S. to receive full welfare and food stamp benefits.
Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation says these costs are just “the tip of the iceberg,” when it comes to supporting illegal immigrant families.
He also notes that the state can subsidize up to $24,000 per family to pay for education, police and fire, medical, and affordable housing coverage.
Rector stated, “They get $3 in benefits for every $1 they spend.”
The Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration could reduce the population taking advantage of these government handouts. This year, Los Angeles county is expected to cut down on these benefits by almost $200 million from 2016 due to several thousand fewer undocumented families accepting state-funded welfare.
“The number of entrants nationwide is going down. The population is static if not shrinking,” Rector said.
Data from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Services shows that more than 58,000 families collected $602 million in benefits in 2015. 64,000 families received a total of $675 million in 2016. The entire county’s population cost the state $3.1 billion in total welfare and food stamps in 2015, and $2.9 billion in 2016.
A quarter of California’s 4 million undocumented immigrants currently reside in Los Angeles county.
Los Angeles’ mayor Eric Garcetti has been one of the most ardent supporters of benefits for illegal immigrants.
“Immigration is at the heart of LA’s story,” Garcetti said. “LA’s become one of the world’s great cities by embracing immigration and diversity and we’ll continue supporting anyone who wants to work hard and invest in our future – no matter who they are, where they came from or what language they speak.”",1
775,"Daily Caller","South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham wondered Sunday how President Donald Trump can negotiate an end to the partial government shutdown “as long as the radical left is in charge.”
Graham told OutletName’s “Face the Nation” that he doesn’t hold out much hope for a quick resolution to the impasse as long as Republicans are dealing with Democrats who are acting like fringe politicians.
“We’re having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], not support ICE. We’re having to negotiate with people who see border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers,” Graham said.
“ICE is not the problem, it’s the solution,” Graham told OutletName. “The goal is to repair a damaged, broken immigration system. It’s to implement policies Democrats have voted for in the past on President Trump’s watch.” “And we’re negotiating with people who will … accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racists. As long as the radical left is in charge, we’re not going to get anywhere,” he told the network.
Graham, who initially balked at supporting Trump’s candidacy to lead the Republican Party in the 2016 presidential election, has become one of the administration’s most loyal legislators. Graham defended Trump’s choice of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice and has even come around to Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, after some initial opposition.
“The president is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security,” Graham insisted. “The goal is to fix a broken immigration system.”
The government remains in a partial shutdown after three weeks of little progress between the president and a Democratic leadership that remains obdurate about not funding a border wall.
Newly reappointed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called the wall “immoral,” prompting the president to quip that she should also object to the wall around the Vatican.
“There is a deal to be had here, but it will include a wall,” Graham said. “And if there’s no wall in this deal, we’ll never have a deal.”",1
577,"Breitbart","Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), appearing on OutletName Sunday morning, slammed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for calling President Donald Trump’s new immigration proposal a plan to “make America white again” on Friday.
“You know what? We don’t need that type of rhetoric on either side,” Manchin told OutletName’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union. Asked whether that meant he “condemned” Pelosi’s remark, Manchin replied that his criticism would apply to both sides: “I’m condemning all this crazy rhetoric that goes on. Just because someone’s a Republican — it’s not my enemy. And we have to work together.”
On Friday, Pelosi said:
Since I’m on the subject of Dreamers, since last night, the president put forth a plan. Let me just say what I said last night, that plan is a campaign to make America white again. It is a plan that says over 50 percent of the current legal immigration will be cut back. … They are changing the character of our country by what they are putting forth. They bring a tear to the eye of the Statue of Liberty.
Pelosi also defended “sanctuary cities” such as her home town of San Francisco.
Trump’s proposal, revealed on Thursday, would grant a “path to citizenship” to 1.8 million so-called “Dreamers” — illegal aliens brought to the country as minors — even if they were not among the roughly 800,000 who applied for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. In return, Trump is demanding $25 billion for border security (including a border wall along most of the U.S.-Mexico border), an end to chain migration, and the cancellation of the diversity visa lottery.
Each of these provisions enjoys wide support among Americans, according to opinion polls. As the OutletName noted last week, a new Harvard-Harris poll “found that 65% of voters overall agreed with Trump’s position that any bill codifying Obama-era protections for illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children should be accompanied by funding for a wall, ending chain migration, and ending the diversity visa lottery program.”
However, Democrats are furious because the plan would cut off their efforts to legalize potentially tens of millions of additional illegal aliens, and forces them to choose between helping the “Dreamers” — the poster children for immigration reform — and pursuing their broader immigration ambitions.
Republicans charge that Democrats are more interested in importing new voters than in helping the people they purport to represent. Advocates for “Dreamers” complain that Trump proposals would make them “second-class citizens” by preventing them from sponsoring family members who brought them to the country illegally.
Manchin was cautiously open to Trump’s plan, hinting that he wanted to see more illegal aliens eligible for a “path to citizenship.”
He cited the Gang of Eight bill in 2013, which passed the Senate but failed in the House, noting that it included funding for border security and legal status for 11 million illegal aliens. That, Manchin suggested, was an example of “going big” on both legalization and border security, whereas Trump’s proposal only went “big” on the latter and “small” on the former.

407,"Breitbart","Prominent leaders of the Democratic Party once fiercely endorsed border security, and had even voted to secure a border fence along the nation’s southern border.
These stringent calls for tougher border policy appear to have ceased since Donald Trump took office as President of the United States.
In 2006, Senate Democrats — including then-senators Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, and Joe Biden — voted to secure a fence along the United States southern border. Check out the instances in which prominent leaders of the Democratic Party championed the border fence and stronger border security overall.
1. Barack Obama
“The bill before us will certainly do some good,” said then-Senator Obama in 2006, adding that the Secure Fence Act would provide “better fences and better security” and that it would make headway against “the tide of illegal immigration in this country.”
“Real reform means stronger border security,” said Obama several years later as president, during his 2013 State Of The Union.
“Independent economists say immigration reform will grow our economy and shrink our deficits by almost one trillion dollars in the next two decades,” said Obama during his 2014 State Of The Union, bringing up his alleged concern about stopping illegal immigration once again.
2. Hillary Clinton
“Look, I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in, and I do think you have to control your borders,” said Clinton, referring to the Secure Fence Act of 2006, “We need to secure our borders, I’m for it, I voted for it, I believe in it.”
3. Bill Clinton
A decade earlier, Hillary Clinton’s husband and then-president Bill Clinton affirmed his own beliefs that illegal immigration should be stopped in his 1995 State Of The Union, stating that “all Americans” were right to be “disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering [the United States],” adding that illegal aliens “impose burdens on [U.S.] taxpayers.”
4. Chuck Schumer
Schumer, who also voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act, elaborated on his pro-border security stance a few years later in a speech at the Georgetown University Law Center, in which the senator told his audience that referring to illegal aliens as “undocumented” is unacceptable.
“Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple,” said Schumer, “When we use phrases like ‘undocumented workers,’ we convey a message to the American people that their government is not serious about combatting illegal immigration, which the American people overwhelmingly oppose.”
“If you don’t think it’s illegal, you’re not going to say it. I think it is illegal, and wrong, and we have to change it,” added the senator.
5. Dianne Feinstein
“Democrats are solidly behind controlling the border, and we support the border fence,” said Feinstein of the Secure Fence Act of 2006.
6. Nancy Pelosi
In 2013, then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi referred to border security as a “basic principle,” and urged congress to support legislation that she claimed would secure the U.S. border.
7. Vice President Joe Biden
“We [President Obama and I] felt so strongly, from the day we took office, for the need for immigration reform,” said Vice President Biden in 2014, who had also voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act when he was a senator.
Biden continued, by criticizing those who choose to enter a foreign country illegally:
“Imagine — you say, ‘I got a good idea, let’s gather up everything we have, sell it, give it to some coyotes to take us to a country that doesn’t want us, drop us off in God knows where, we don’t [know] anybody, we leave everything that’s familiar to us. Let’s go, isn’t that going to be a great idea?’ These are horrible decisions these people are making.”

Hundreds of people attend an evening rally at Washington Square Park in support of Muslims, immigrants and against the building of a wall along the Mexican border on January 25, 2017 in New York City. President Donald Trump took actions today to start the building of a long promised wall along the Mexican border and to cut federal grants for immigrant protecting ""sanctuary cities"". Several big city mayors across the U.S. on Wednesday vowed to defy President Trump’s executive order that threatens to cut off federal funding to cities that offer some sort of protection to undocumented immigrants in their communities.
Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that directs the government to identify federal money it can withhold to punish so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" a term for hundreds of communities that in some way limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents
But as Trump announced the order — as well as action to build a wall along the U.S-Mexico border and hire thousands of new border patrol agents and immigration officers — leaders of some of the nation's biggest cities flatly stated they would not be cooperating with the president.
In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed that the action “won’t change how we enforce the law in New York City.”
De Blasio said that the city has been able to dramatically reduce the crime rate in the nation’s largest city, because police officials have managed to build in immigrant communities. He added that if Trump went through with his plan to slash funds it would lead to the president, a native New Yorker, cutting funding from the New York Police Department. An early analysis by NYC officials suggested that about $156 million in federal funding for the NYPD could be impacted.
“Here in New York City and in cities across the nation, this executive order could in fact undermine public safety and make our neighborhoods less safe,” De Blasio said.
In Boston, Mayor Marty Walsh called the executive order an attack on ""Boston’s people, Boston’s strength and Boston’s values.”
“If people want to live here, they’ll live here,” Walsh told reporters at a news conference. “They can use my office. They can use any office in this building.”
In Seattle, Mayor Ed Murray said that he had directed city departments to review their budgets to prepare for a potential loss of federal funding, the Associated Press reports.
""This city will not be bullied by this administration,"" Murray said. ""We believe we have the rule of law and the courts on our side.""
In Chicago, where Trump has pilloried the mayor over the surge in violence in the city, Mayor Rahm Emanuel vowed that the nation’s third largest city would remain a sanctuary city. Emanuel sidestepped questions at an afternoon news conference about how the city would weather a potential cut in federal funding.
“I want to be clear. We're gonna stay a sanctuary city,"" Emanuel said. ""There is no stranger among us. We welcome people, whether you're from Poland or Pakistan, whether you're from Ireland or India or Israel and whether you're from Mexico or Moldova, where my grandfather came from, you are welcome in Chicago as you pursue the American Dream.""
Whether you're from Poland or Pakistan, India or Ireland, Israel, Mexico or Moldova, you are welcome in Chicago ://t.co/lDuCLgfrP3 — ChicagosMayor () January 25, 2017
In San Francisco, Mayor Ed Lee told reporters after Trump signed the executive order that nothing has changed for his city.
“I am here today to say we are still a sanctuary city,” Lee said. “We stand by our sanctuary city because we want everybody to feel safe and utilize the services they deserve, including education and health care.”
Both Lee and De Blasio said that early readings of the executive reading by their lawyers suggest that the document is vaguely written and predicted that the Trump administration would face a tough legal battle if it tries to use it as a basis to slash funding.
“There is less here than meets the eye,” De Blasio said
In Detroit, a top aide to Mayor Mike Duggan, questioned whether the city even qualified as a sanctuary city.
The Detroit City Council in 2007 passed legislation prohibiting city employees, including police, form asking about person’s immigration status unless it was directly related to an alleged crime. City officials say that Detroit police, however, regularly cooperated with requests from federal immigration officials.
“We do not believe this applies to the city of Detroit,"" said Alexis Wiley, Mayor Mike Duggan's chief of staff. ""We do cooperate fully with all federal agencies during the course of criminal investigations, regardless of a person’s immigration status.”

The U.S. Conference of Mayors and the Major Cities Chief Association expressed concern that the executive order is overly vague.
“That order does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes a sanctuary jurisdiction,” the organizations said in a joint statement. “Instead, it gives undefined discretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate sanctuary jurisdictions and the Attorney General to take action against them. We call upon the Secretary of Homeland Security to document and promulgate a lawful definition before further actions are taken, so the cities across the Nation may determine how to proceed.""",0
419,"Breitbart","A Texas woman was sentenced to six years in federal prison and a nearly $800,000 fine after she was convicted of harboring two illegal aliens, forcing them to work as maids without pay.
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency announced that Olga Sandra Murra, 64, of Fort Worth, was sentenced and expected to pay $795,000 in restitution to her victims, both of which are illegal aliens.
Murra was convicted on two counts of forced labor and two counts of harboring illegal aliens after threatening her two victims with deportation and subsequently forcing them to work.
Murra, a Mexican immigrant herself, moved to Forth Worth in 1997, bringing one of her victims with her, along with other family members. The following year, Murra arranged for her other victim to be brought into the U.S. illegally.
Between September 1997 and April 2011, Murra kept either one of both victims at her residences in Fort Worth or in El Paso. During this time period, Murra forced both victims to work for her cleaning business, in which she forced them to hand all of their earnings over to her by threatening to call immigration officials on them. The victims would work up to seven days a week sometimes and cleaned nearly three to four homes a day. Murra also ordered the illegal aliens to cook food for her at her own residence.
At some point, Murra presented herself as a religious figure to the women, making them listen to voice recordings of her reading Bible verses and told them that if they did not obey her, they would go to hell. Murra allegedly hit one of the victims and threatened the other.
Murra restricted their bathroom use and food intake to bread and water. The victims would be punished by being forced to sleep in the backyard or garage.
Murra also forced one of her victims to work at McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, aside from working at her cleaning business, continuing to take all of the victims’ earnings.
The case was investigated by ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) division and prosecuted by Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Allen-McCoy and Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Wirmani.

475,"Breitbart","Univision anchor Jorge Ramos insisted on Tuesday that a border wall will not prevent illegal immigrants and drugs from entering the country and said Americans must accept that the U.S.-Mexico border is “nothing more than an invention.”
“No matter how much you might want to seal the border between Mexico and the United States, its simply not possible. You might temporarily stop, delay, complicate or hinder the flow of immigrants and drugs from south to north, but nothing will ever stop it entirely,” he wrote in his Tuesday Univision column. “Though it may upset some politicians who’ve spent years making false promises, this is the reality of the situation.”
Ramos, who has said that the United States has a responsibility to “absorb” Central American migrants, said that “if there is anything immigrants are known for, it’s for their innovative thinking. When they come to a wall, they simply go around it. Or over it. Or they find a ladder to climb it. Or dig a tunnel underneath. Or they arrive by plane and overstay their visas. Walls by themselves are pretty useless.”
“If by some magic (or through behind-the-scenes negotiations), President Donald Trump could get the $5.7 billion he’s been asking for to build a wall, it would be of very little use,” Ramos continued. “That money would only get him about 234 miles worth of wall, according to the White House. What about the rest of the border?”
The amnesty activist also said that the “border has been a crooked proposition from the beginning, and it will continue to be twisted to meet political ends,” adding that many open-borders activists still insist that “people didn’t cross the border, the border crossed them.”
“At some point we will have to accept the fact that the border between Mexico and the United States is nothing more than an invention. It was demarcated in 1848, following a war that cost Mexico about half its territory (it’s no coincidence that cities like Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Francisco have Spanish names),” Ramos said. “Also, it’s been said a thousand times that many people didn’t cross the border, the border crossed them. And the cultural and commercial ties between the two sides remain in place to this day. Look at the fellowship exhibited by cities like El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico even if barbed wire and concrete barriers have been erected in some places along the divide.”
Ramos criticized Trump for comparing the U.S.-Mexico border wall to Israel’s because he said the United States and Mexico are not at war like the Israelis and the Palestinians. He also said “there isn’t a crisis at the border warranting a wall or the deployment of troops.”
“Yes, all countries have the right to mark and protect their borders. But the histories and traditions of countries like Mexico and the United States are so intertwined that there is no practical or legal way a wall would keep them apart,” Ramos added. “Some politicians, like Trump, may well try to come up with a way, but they are doomed to failure every time.”",1
50,"FoxNews","A 20-year-old man in the country illegally who was street-racing when he crashed into a car in Oregon, killing a woman, was able to flee to Mexico after local authorities did not honor an immigration detainer, according to federal officials. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said in a news release on Tuesday that Alejandro Maldonado-Hernandez was arrested on July 12 in connection with the fatal car crash that killed Janice Ator and seriously injured her husband, Patrick Ator. After he was released from the hospital with minor injuries, Maldonado-Hernandez was booked into the Washington County Jail on charges of felony manslaughter in the second degree, felony assault in the third degree and misdemeanor reckless driving. ICE said that officers lodged an immigration detainer on July 16, but that by Aug. 8 the jail failed to honor it and let the 20-year-old go after he posted bail. “It is real slap in the face to the victim's friends and family when criminal aliens, in this case a man who has caused the death of a woman and severe injuries to her husband, are released into the community due to dangerous sanctuary policies,” Nathalie Asher, Seattle field office director for ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, said in a statement. “How many lives have to be lost before politicians are more concerned about public safety than their own political agendas?” ICE said that according to a Washington County Sherriff’s Department news alert, investigators learned on Aug. 27 that Maldonado-Hernandez fled to Mexico to avoid prosecution. The 20-year-old remains at large, federal officials said. Three people accused of helping him flee to Mexico – Ernesto Garcia, 20, Alicia Scardina, 21 and Luis Maldonado-Hernandez, 28 – were arrested the following day on charges of hindering prosecution, FOX12 Oregon reported at the time. Federal officials contend that under the law, ICE has the authority to lodge immigration detainers with law enforcement partners who have custody of individuals arrested on criminal charges and who ICE has probable cause to believe are removable. ""The detainer form asks the other law enforcement agency to notify ICE in advance of release and to maintain custody of the alien for a brief period of time so that ICE can take custody of that person in a safe and secure setting upon release from that agency’s custody,"" the agency states. ""Yet, across the United States, several jurisdictions refuse to honor detainers and instead choose to willingly release criminal offenders back into their local communities where they are free to offend."" Officials, however, have pointed out that jails in Oregon can't recognize civil detainers because of a 2014 federal court decision that found Clackamas County violated a woman's rights by holding her beyond her release date while federal authorities investigated her immigration status. The Washington County Sheriff's Office told FOX12 on Tuesday that ICE detainers are ""simply put,"" not lawful or enforceable and that “had ICE agents provided a valid warrant or order signed by a federal judge during that time, Mr. Maldonado-Hernandez would have remained in custody.” “The continuing refusal of ICE agents to provide necessary legal justification for holding people they believe are a danger to our community is the real problem, not the sheriff's office insistence on following state law,” the sheriff's office told FOX12. ICE previously said it's turned to courthouses to arrest immigrants who qualify for deportation because local policies have prevented county jails and state prisons from cooperating to allow wanted individuals to be transferred to the custody of immigration officials. A new rule enacted earlier this month by Oregon Supreme Court Chief Justice Martha Walters forbids ICE agents from arresting immigrants inside or near the state's courthouses unless the agents first receive warrants from a judge. Patrick Ator and his wife were married for 57 years and were ""totally happy"" up until the deadly crash. 
“When it was all over, I woke up and looked over at my wife. She wasn’t talking,"" he told FOX12 on Tuesday. ""I felt her pulse and there was no pulse. In my head I said, ‘Lord, why don’t you take me too?’” Former ICE acting director and OutletName contributor Tom Homan sounds off on officials putting politics over safety. His daughter, Deborah Goldstein, said her parents' relationship was described by people as ""one of the best marriages they’ve ever seen."" “She was a great mother, an incredible mother and a lot of fun to be with,” Goldstein said Tuesday. Ator and Goldstein told FOX12 that the debate over the law and jurisdiction of the two law enforcement agencies is beyond them, and they’re still just trying to heal four months after the deadly crash. “I worry that they will get away with too little, but at the same time, that’s beyond me,"" Ator said. ""My wife and I lost our togetherness and that’s really what I’m concentrating on. I don’t worry about the people that caused it.""",1

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said earlier Sunday that the agency ""reached capacity at the San Ysidro port of entry for CBP officers to be able to bring additional persons traveling without appropriate entry documentation into the port of entry for processing."" Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told OutletName in a statement that immigrants ""may need to wait in Mexico as CBP officers work to process those already within our facilities."" Hundreds of migrants involved in a caravan to the United States weigh a showdown with the American border authorities; William La Jeunesse reports from Tijuana, Mexico. Despite the announcement, about 50 people walked across a bridge and approached the port facility, but were not immediately accommodated by U.S. officials. They were being permitted to wait in passageways until room became available, and appeared prepared to wait overnight, according to Irineo Mujica, one of the organizers of Pueblos Sin Fronteras, an organization assisting the asylum speakers. Another 50 prepared to camp outside a gate on the Mexican side of the border crossing with backpacks and blankets hoping to get their turn on Monday. Immigration officials had warned that the San Ysidro border crossing may not be able hold many asylum-seekers if it faces too many at once. The port of entry, according to the agency, can hold about 300 people temporarily. Roughly 200 people, including women and young children, were expected to turn themselves over to border inspectors after arriving in Tijuana last week, claiming they had a credible fear of persecution at home. Demonstrators gathered along the border to hold a rally in the hours before crossing over, with some people scaling the fence. ""The only thing I would tell Mr. Trump is to have a conscious and to look at all the people and the way they suffer. Because the people, they are coming from those countries, they are not doing it for pleasure,"" Osman Salvador Ulla Castro, who is from Honduras, told OutletName. ""They face danger and extortions and they are looking for a better life."" The Border Patrol said Saturday that several groups of families from the caravan earlier tried to enter the U.S. illegally by scaling parts of the ""dilapidated scrap metal border fence"" near San Ysidro. 
""In several of these incidents, children as young as 4 years old, and in one case a pregnant female, were detected entering the United States illegally through a dark, treacherous canyon that is notorious for human and drug smuggling,"" U.S. Customs and Border Protection San Diego Chief Patrol Agent Rodney Scott said. ""As a father myself, I find it unconscionable that anyone would expose a child to these dangerous conditions."" The Trump administration has been tracking the caravan since it started March 25 near the Guatemala border, calling it a threat to the U.S., in addition to promising a swift response. The administration has also claimed the caravan represented a deliberate attempt to overwhelm the U.S. legal system and the courts. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said last week that asylum claims would be resolved ""efficiently and expeditiously,"" but that the asylum-seekers should seek it in the first safe country they reach, including Mexico. Caravan of migrants expected to attempt to cross into U.S. this weekend. Asylum-seekers typically are separated from their children and held up to three days at the border before being turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If they pass an asylum officer's initial screening, they may be detained for several months until their court hearing or released with ankle monitors. Nearly 80 percent of asylum-seekers passed the initial screening from October through December, according to the latest numbers available, but few are likely to eventually win asylum. Any asylum seekers making false claims to U.S. authorities could be prosecuted, as could anyone who assists or coaches immigrants on making false claims, according to Nielsen. Administration officials and their allies claim asylum fraud is growing and that many who seek it are coached on how to do so. U.S. immigration lawyers who went to Tijuana have denied coaching people in the caravan, but have said they have been providing one-on-one counseling to assess the merits of their cases and how asylum works in the U.S. ""Like how to defend myself with immigration, how to carry myself,"" a 16-year-old unaccompanied minor from Honduras told OutletName on Saturday regarding the meetings he's had with lawyers. Heather Crone, of U.S. advocacy group Show Up for Racial Justice, said Sundays he's found 80 people in America who have agreed to sponsor caravan members if they're released while their petitions are pending. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called the caravan ""a deliberate attempt to undermine our laws and overwhelm our system,"" pledging to send more immigration judges to the border to resolve cases if needed.",1
2462,"Reuters","California’s “sanctuary state” laws largely survived a legal attack by the Trump administration on Thursday after a federal judge declined to block state measures aimed at thwarting cooperation with Washington’s crackdown on illegal immigration. But the judge, John Mendez of U.S. District Court in Sacramento, also rebuked lawmakers, saying that the immigration issue could not ultimately be settled in the courts and said elected leaders needed to put aside differences and forge legislation. California Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed into law in October measures that, among other things, prevent police from inquiring about immigration status and curtailing law enforcement cooperation with immigration officers. The law extended to the entire state protections for illegal immigrants that exist in several so-called sanctuary cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. On Thursday, Mendez largely sided with the state against the Trump administration, which was seeking an injunction to prevent California from enforcing the measures. Mendez did, however, issue an injunction that bars California officials from imposing fines of up to $10,000 on employers who grant immigration officials access to a private workplace or to employment records. U.S. Department of Justice spokesman Devin O’Malley called the ruling blocking the fines a “major victory for private employers in California who are no longer prevented from cooperating with legitimate enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws.” The Department of Justice will continue to fight “unjust policies that threaten public safety,” O’Malley said in a statement. The judge, in his 60-page ruling, said he hoped his order would “not be viewed through a political lens” and said a long-term immigration solution could not come from “piecemeal opinions issued by the judicial branch.” Mendez said he was joining “the ever-growing chorus” of judges urging elected officials to set aside polarizing politics and work in a cooperative fashion toward passing immigration legislation. “Our nation deserves it,” wrote the judge, who was appointed by President George W. Bush. “Our Constitution demands it.” The Justice Department had sued California in March, taking aim at three laws that the administration said violated the U.S. Constitution. California, the country’s most populous state, leads the nation in its population of illegal immigrants, with more than 2.3 million people lacking legal status, according to the Pew Research Center. The Trump administration has been battling hundreds of cities and other jurisdictions, many Democratic-governed, that have adopted sanctuary policies. Thursday’s ruling follows a several legal setbacks for the administration over sanctuary cities. In April, a federal appeals court said the administration cannot deny public safety grants to cities that limit cooperation with the Trump administration, in a case brought by Chicago.",0
2232,"USA Today","A protester holds a sign in support of refugees as she prepares to join a march around the Quad at the University of Alabama, in Tuscaloosa, Ala., to express their discontent with President Trump's executive order on immigration. Nearly 1,000 State Department staffers have signed a letter expressing disagreement with President Trump’s executive order that temporarily suspends the U.S. refugee program and bars immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries in the Middle East and Africa.
The letter, and a comment by White House spokesman Sean Spicer that dissenters should “get with the program or they should go,” prompted Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee to tell Trump to refrain from retaliating against State Department employees. The State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual prohibits reprisal or disciplinary action against anyone who uses the formal channel, the lawmakers said.
“We are requesting your assurances that State Department personnel will not be subject to harassment or retribution if they take advantage of the Dissent Channel or offer policy advice that doesn’t align with White House policy decisions,” the letter, signed by Rep. Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the committee, and other members, said.
The letter originated at the consular division of State, which handles visas and refugee applications, and was signed by at least 900 State Department staffers, including senior officials, according to Democratic Congressional aide. The aide, who is familiar with the letter but was not authorized to discuss it publicly, requested anonymity.
The State Department confirmed a “dissent cable” Tuesday, but would not characterize the subjects, number or level of signatories, in order to respect the process that permits individuals to express views to senior leadership.
“The Dissent Channel is a longstanding official vehicle for State Department employees to convey alternative views and perspectives on policy issues,” said acting spokesperson Mark Toner. “This is an important process that the Acting Secretary, and the department as a whole, value and respect. It allows State employees to express divergent policy views candidly and privately to senior leadership.”
According to State’s Foreign Affairs Manual: “Officers or employees found to have engaged in retaliation or reprisal against Dissent Channel users, or to have divulged to unauthorized personnel the source or contents of Dissent Channel messages, will be subject to disciplinary action.”",0
2241,"USA Today","The Immigration Act of 1917 was one of the most discriminatory immigration acts in American history. Now critics say history is repeating itself under President Trump. OutletNameSunday marks the centennial of one of the darkest, most discriminatory immigration turns in American history: the passage of the Immigration Act of 1917. The law banned immigrants from the Asiatic Barred Zone, a new, massive region that included Saudi Arabia, most of China, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
Now, 100 years and 16 presidents later, some see that ugly history repeating itself.
Less than a week after moving into the White House, President Trump signed an order to increase deportations of an undocumented immigrant population that is 77% Hispanic and 15% Asian. He then instituted a temporary travel ban from countries that are 98% Muslim and suspended the admission of refugees who come mostly from Africa and the Middle East.
In some ways, the 1917 law serves as a reminder of how different the times were back then. It banned ""idiots"" and ""imbeciles"" and created a literacy test targeting immigrants from eastern Europe. But immigration historians see similarities in the hostility toward foreign settlers that's on display a century later.
Trump said he halted the refugee program for 120 days and barred immigration from seven majority Muslim countries for 90 days to give security agencies time to improve vetting procedures for people coming from terror-prone countries. He also vowed to build a wall along the southern border to stem illegal immigration.
Alan Kraut sees something else happening. ""From the moment that Trump in his campaign characterized Mexicans as a bunch of criminals, and talked about Muslims in a negative way, it was clear to me and many other scholars around the country where this theme came from,"" said Kraut, a history professor at American University and past president of the Organization of American Historians. ""It had a long echo.""
As damaging as the Immigration Act of 1917 was, it was just one chapter in America's long history of discrimination that goes back to the battles against Native Americans and the enslavement of African-Americans. There were periods of intense anti-Catholicism focused on the Irish and the Germans and multiple periods of rampant anti-Semitism.
Asians became an increasing target during the California gold rush, as tales of gold-filled rivers lured thousands to California. That led to passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the so-called ""Gentlemen's Agreement"" of 1907, which banned most immigrants from Japan.
The fear of an Asian onslaught, dubbed the ""Yellow Peril,"" culminated in the Immigration Act of 1917, which had such overwhelming support in Congress that it became law despite a veto by President Woodrow Wilson. It was followed by the Immigration Act of 1924, which created an immigration quota system that favored immigrants from Western Europe and marginalized Asians, Africans and other ethnic groups.
Taeku Lee, a professor of political science and law at the University of California-Berkeley, said he senses a similar nativist sentiment today that is driven by a mix of demographic changes, economic insecurity and anxieties about national security.
""Today’s fantasied scourge of 'aliens' from south of the border and terrorists cloaked in the garb of refugees is the Yellow Peril of the late 19th and early 20th century,"" Lee said.
Lee sees another difference. Wilson opposed the 1917 law and led ""a charge for freedom and against totalitarianism"" around the world, including the creation of the League of Nations following World War I. By contrast, Trump's focus is inward looking, as he speaks critically about the United Nations and NATO while ""shying away from this long-standing role of 'leader of the Free World.'""
The first step toward overcoming the revival of nativism is to understand its roots, said Ali Noorani, the executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a group that advocates for immigrants in the U.S.
""I think it's important to acknowledge the large number of Americans who are worried, who are afraid,"" he said. ""We have to understand what that fear is.""
Noorani, whose parents immigrated to California in 1971 from Pakistan, one of the banned countries in 1917, said he has reason for hope: The U.S. has always risen up from its lowest moments, as it did in 1965 when Congress passed a law that eliminated the 1917 Asiatic Barred Zone and rescinded the quota system.
""The American story is a story about these kinds of moments. You see dark moments like 1917 followed by incredible moments like 1965,"" he said. ""What gets us out of this dark moment is leadership from a range of civic and political leaders saying, 'America is better than this.'
""But that's not going to happen overnight,"" Noorani added, ""just like fixing what happened in 1917 didn't happen overnight.""",0
2151,"USA Today","The Trump administration is seeking a fast track to the Supreme Court in hopes of reversing a federal judge's order to restart a popular program allowing young, undocumented immigrants to remain in the United States.
The Justice Department announced Tuesday that it will appeal U.S. District Judge William Alsup's decision both to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit and to the Supreme Court — something it admitted was a rare step. In the meantime, it did not ask either court to block Alsup's ruling.
The strategy appears aimed both at a speedy final resolution to the legal battle over DACA — the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — and a friendlier court. The high court has allowed other Trump administration policies to continue, most notably his immigration travel ban, over federal court rejections.
“It defies both law and common sense for DACA ... to somehow be mandated nationwide by a single district court in San Francisco,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said.
""We are now taking the rare step of requesting direct review on the merits of this injunction by the Supreme Court so that this issue may be resolved quickly and fairly for all the parties involved.”
Faced with last week's decision, the administration on Saturday announced that it would resume accepting renewal applications from immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. Alsup's ruling did not require that it accept new applicants.
The administration announced last September that the program, begun by president Barack Obama in 2012, would end unless it was renewed by Congress within six months.
Since then, negotiations have been tied up with the federal budget and other issues — most recently Trump's description of some Third World countries as ""shitholes,"" which further set back talks. Trump has demanded tighter border enforcement, including building a wall along the Mexican border.
The DACA program has protected about 800,000 ""DREAMers"" whose illegal status wasn't their fault. It has enabled them to avoid deportation and to gain work permits.
In his ruling, Alsup granted a request by California, the University of California system, and several California cities to block the phaseout while their lawsuit challenging the termination plays out in court. He said those already approved for protection and work permits must be allowed to renew them before they expire.
Alsup said the challengers were likely to succeed by claiming that the Trump administration's decision to end the program was ""arbitrary and capricious"" and based on a flawed legal premise. He said the plaintiffs would be harmed, in part through economic disruptions and the loss of tax revenue caused by the DREAMers' departure.
Sessions announced on Sept. 5 that the program would be phased out six months later, based on the administration's view that it was illegally enacted without action by Congress. Trump then urged lawmakers to come up with a permanent solution. But four months have passed, and a deal has remained elusive.
About 800,000 DREAMers have been approved for protection since the program started accepting applications in 2012. As of September, about 690,000 were enrolled.",0

61,"FoxNews","President Trump may have lost the early legal skirmishes over his executive order on immigration, but in the end he will likely win. The overwhelming weight of history and the law is on his side. The president does have the authority to ban the entry of foreigners, as long as he has what is called a “rational basis” to believe they pose a threat to the nation’s security. He does, and his order is designed to accomplish precisely that. The seven nations targeted by Trump in his immigration ban were originally identified in an anti-terrorism law signed by President Obama. Unlike other Muslim-majority nations that have a history of terrorism, these seven countries do not assist the U.S. in providing background checks and other vetting of immigrant applicants. Thus, it is not only “rational” to deny entry, it is imperative for the safety of Americans. The U.S. does not have the resources to properly vet all these individuals on its own. Shortly after the executive order was put in place, several federal court judges issued temporary restraining orders. Most of those TROs halted the detention and deportation of foreigners who had already been issued legal immigration visas.  Many had already arrived in the U.S. But that is a very small part of the president’s order. The merits of those TROs, not to mention the president’s order itself, have yet to be fully litigated.  The judicial rulings were issued “ex parte”.  That is, only one side was represented in court.  The Trump administration lawyers haven’t even been given a chance to appear in court to say, “good morning, your honor.” All of that may change once both sides are represented in court. The Washington State Case The ruling in Seattle by U.S. District Court Judge James Robart was different and far more expansive.  He issued a temporary hold on the immigration ban nationwide. Lawyers at the Department of Justice appealed to the 9th Circuit which refused to overturn Judge Robart’s ruling, although further briefs have been filed. Thereafter, the 9th Circuit could revisit its decision. It is no surprise that the 9th Circuit got it wrong.  It is the most overturned appellate court in the nation.  There’s a joke among California lawyers: if you lose your case in the 9th Circuit, you’re assured of winning it before the Supreme Court.  Get the picture? Nevertheless, the Seattle ruling is the case to watch, in part because Washington became the first state to sue. Take a look at judge Robart’s decision. It is largely devoid of any legal reasoning or sound analysis. Its brevity is exceeded only by its lack of logic as applied to the law. Absence of Standing to Sue             Washington State does not have “standing” to sue on behalf of its residents because they have suffered no ""actual harm"" from Trump's order. In order to sustain a lawsuit, the plaintiffs must demonstrate their alleged injury is direct and real, not merely hypothetical.  The harm must be imminent and irreparable, not speculative.  So how have Washington residents been harmed?  Lawyers for the state suggest their economy will be adversely impacted because the ban may prevent immigrants from working for Washington-based companies. Taxes might be reduced and its education system could be affected. However, all of that is pure conjecture.  It might happen, but it might not.  Hence, it does not constitute immediate “actual harm.” On that basis alone, the lawsuit should be dismissed.  Foreigners Do Not Enjoy Constitutional Rights   The vast majority of people affected by President Trump’s executive order are people who do not have legally valid immigration visas but are seeking entry to the United States by undertaking the lengthy application process. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people. The claim by Washington State that the immigration ban violates the First Amendment (freedom of religion) or the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments (equal protection clause) may seem, at first blush, like a reasonable argument.  Until you consider that our Constitution applies only to citizens and those on American soil. A man in Somalia may wish to invoke our Constitution to claim his freedom of religion is being infringed, but until he arrives here he enjoys none of its privileges and protections.  He has no right to assert discrimination, religious or otherwise.  And the state of Washington has no legal right to represent him in court.  It can only represent its own residents.  The President Has Authority to Dictate Immigration Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate immigration. In 1952, Congress passed a law empowering the president to deny entry into the U.S. to “any class of aliens” considered to be “detrimental to the interests of the United States.”  In other words, a threat to America and in the interests of national security. As I pointed out in a recent column, the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that Congress and the president have “plenary power” to regulate immigration.  For more than a century, the high court has consistently upheld such authority and rejected constitutional challenges to presidential action banning entire groups of foreigners.  Even the 9th Circuit has endorsed this legal principle.  Past presidents, including Carter and Obama, have issued orders similar to Trump’s. It is true that a subsequent 1965 immigration law prohibits discrimination based on race, sex, nationality, place of birth or place of residence. But that law says nothing about religion. And, more importantly, it applies only to the issuance of visas.  The president’s authority to deny entry to a large class of aliens is a broader power which supersedes individual visa considerations. Trump’s Executive Order Is Temporary Lost in all the legal tumult is the fact that President Trump’s executive order is only temporary: It applies for just 90 days for people in the seven designated countries that are sources of terrorism and 120 days for “refugees.” (The Syrian ban is “indefinite,” but that could change, too.) By the time each side has had the opportunity to fully litigate the merits of the various cases and undertaken the usual course of appeals, the executive order will likely have expired. That may render most of the cases moot. Absent a legal controversy, there would be nothing for judges to resolve. The petitions and lawsuits would probably be dismissed. For now, however, the Seattle case may head to a hearing before the full complement of judges on the 9th Circuit Court, known as an “en banc” session.  Or, the Department of Justice may seek an emergency application to the U.S. Supreme Court. The latter action might be imprudent, since the current court has only eight sitting justices. A 4-4 tie would allow the 9th Circuit’s decision to stand.  It would make more sense to wait for the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to cast the ninth, and perhaps deciding, vote. Given the great weight of the law in favor of the president, the decision should be unanimous. But why take the chance? Unwise To Attack a Federal Judge True to form, President Trump launched a Twitter attack on Judge Robart’s decision, calling him a “so-called judge” who issued a “ridiculous” decision. I agree, the decision is ridiculous to the extent it is based on scant legal analysis and completely contravenes long established law. Nevertheless, it is unwise and counterproductive to personally insult or demean a judge by questioning his legitimacy. Judges tend to be a collegial group. An attack on one may be viewed as an attack on all. Why create an underlying reason in the minds of appellate judges to find a way to support one of their brethren? A better strategy would be to compliment the Boston judge who affirmed Mr. Trump’s executive order. In a 21 page decision issued on February 3, Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton eloquently explains the power of the president embedded in sturdy constitutional principles. It is a thoughtful and comprehensive treatise on how our laws and the courts have spoken in unison on immigration authority. If any of these immigration cases ever reach the Supreme Court, Judge Gorton’s opinion may be the foundation for their decision.",1
188,"FoxNews","Everywhere President Donald Trump looks, he sees a wall.
As he lobbies for money for his long-promised border wall, Trump keeps talking up other barricades. He's pointing to walls in Israel, at the Vatican, even at former President Barack Obama's house — though fact checkers have pushed back on the accuracy of some of his claims.
With bricks and mortar on his mind, Trump declared at a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, ""Walls work.""
He added: ""There's a reason why politicians and wealthy people build walls around their houses and their compounds. President Obama recently built a wall around his compound.""
Trump also tweeted that Obama's wall was 10 feet high. But while fencing has been added around the Obamas' spacious house in Washington's tony Kalorama neighborhood, there is no 10-foot wall.
It's all part of Trump's effort to prevail in an increasingly difficult standoff with congressional Democrats over border funding that has produced a partial shutdown of the federal government.
But David Bier, an immigration policy analyst for the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said there is little comparison between the demands for private security and border security.
""It doesn't make sense to compare"" the two, said Bier, pointing to the difference between a home break-in and migrants trying to seek asylum.
Another favorite structure for Trump is the fortifications at the Vatican, which he has cited in the past as an argument for the wall and brought up again at the Cabinet meeting, this time making a moral argument.
""When they say the wall is immoral, well then you better — got to do something about the Vatican, because the Vatican has the biggest wall of them all,"" Trump said.
Much of Vatican City is off-limits to the general public but walls there do not block all access. St. Peter's Square is not behind any walls. The Vatican Museums are walled but the public may enter with a ticket and security screening.
Trump's immigration policies have drawn criticism from Pope Francis, who has said in the past that anyone who wants to build walls to keep out migrants is ""not Christian.""
Former Trump aide Sam Nunberg said that in some of these examples, Trump was trying to argue that his opponents are saying ""do as I say, not as I do.""
Trump and allies have repeatedly cited barriers in Israel as proof that walls are effective. Trump said this week he had recently spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, adding ""In Israel, as you know, they built a wall. He said 99.9 percent it works. And it would with us too.""
Bier said a direct comparison with Israel's border security is challenging because the U.S. border is much longer and has different terrain, including mountains, raising questions about whether building a physical wall is the best approach.
""I think it's fair to say that border barriers make it easier to catch people who are coming into the country,"" Bier said. ""The question is whether it is as effective in areas where the president wants to build.""
With no end to the border fight in sight, Trump is likely to keep up his wall commentary — although at times his rhetoric sends mixed messages.
His message Thursday: ""You can call it a wall. You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want.""",1
211,"FoxNews","So, what exactly is the Democratic border security proposal? Would it actually secure the border?
We had some time, so we checked. In a word, no, it would not.
The Democratic bill in the Senate simply restores previous funding levels for the border patrol and other existing programs. So you have to ask yourself, when you consider that, the following: Was the border secure in December, before the shutdown?
No, it was not. That’s why we’re having this debate right now. Then how will it be more secure after a bill that doesn’t change anything passes? Well, it wouldn’t be. That’s the point of the legislation -- to maintain the broken status quo.
Meanwhile, in the House, Homeland Security Committee Chair Bennie Thompson says he plans to introduce a bill that contains billions for border security, but nothing for a wall. Thompson has a brand new idea, he tells us. Thompson says we can secure the border with the marvels of technology. He recently told PBS that cutting-edge machines can help us “identify those vulnerabilities” on the border.
Thompson’s plan can expect enthusiastic support from the congresswoman from Tech Land, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
""The positive, technological wall that can be built is what we should be doing,"" she has said. ""Technology to scan the cars coming through the ports of entry ... and that is to detect guns. It’s like an electronic dog almost to detect drugs, guns and other contraband.""
It’s really like an electronic dog that can detect contraband. On one level, it’s hilarious, and we’ve laughed about it before. But it’s also patronizing, really. You’d have to be totally ignorant of what’s happening at the border to believe that more surveillance is going to solve the problem. We have an awful lot of surveillance technology already. You have drones, cameras, sensors, radar, dirigibles.
We have it all there, in part, because the George W. Bush administration put it there. That administration spent more than a billion dollars on something called the Secure Border Initiative Network. It used technology to watch about 50 miles of our southern border. Congressman Bennie Thompson himself called that program a “grave and expensive disappointment.” Well, Thompson was right about that. What’s changed is that Democrats now support grave and expensive disappointments. They specialize in grave and expensive disappointments. They’re pushing one now.
Democrats have become extremists on the question of borders. You’d never know that from watching television or reading the paper. The media won’t say it. Nor will most Republicans, by the way. Even in the Trump administration, some officials seem intent on making Nancy Pelosi’s case for her, that Republicans are the real extremists here.
That’s shortsighted. Leaving the politics aside, it’s not a good idea because our southern border is one of America’s most dangerous vulnerabilities. That’s not a talking point. It’s literally true. Here’s why: As of this week, Mexico is an intact country. Will it remain an intact country? Maybe. But maybe not.
Mexico is a deeply unstable place. That’s not an attack on the Mexican people; it’s an acknowledgment of what anyone who knows anything about the country will tell you. The national murder rate is five times ours. Since 2006, more than 250,000 people – that’s a quarter million – have been murdered in Mexico, including hundreds of politicians and judges. There’s a war going on in Mexico, and it’s spurred by drug cartels that reach into the highest levels of the Mexican government. That's not an exaggeration.
The attorney general of an entire Mexican state recently pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges. A governor of a state on the U.S. border took bribes to let cartels operate freely, which they did. And just the other day, the country’s previous president was credibly accused by a witness at trial, in court, of taking a $100 million bribe from El Chapo Guzman
In effect, Mexico has become a narcostate. But it’s not even the most volatile country in the region. Nicaragua is in severe turmoil. That gets no coverage, but it’s real. Parts of El Salvador are largely controlled by gangs. Venezuela, meanwhile, is literally falling apart. A recent Brookings Institution report predicted that a total collapse in Venezuela, which could happen any day, might create 8 million refugees. For perspective, that’s more refugees than the ones that fled the entire Syrian Civil War. Keep in mind, that flood of humanity upended all of Europe.
Something similar could easily happen here, to us. It likely will if we ignore the problem, which we are doing. And yet the position of Democrats in Washington is that everything is fine, and you’re nuts if you disagree. Nothing needs to be done. That’s the definition of recklessness. In fact, it’s worse than recklessness. It’s like letting your kids play in traffic. You wouldn’t do that to people you cared about. You’d prevent it from happening.
Democrats have become extremists on the question of borders. You’d never know that from watching television or reading the paper. The media won’t say it. Nor will most Republicans, by the way. Even in the Trump administration, some officials seem intent on making Nancy Pelosi’s case for her, that Republicans are the real extremists here.
Here’s what Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said when asked on another cable news newtwork about workers who aren’t being paid during the shutdown: ""The people might have to pay a little bit of interest, but the idea that it's paycheck or zero is not a really valid idea,"" he said. ""There have been ads run by a number of the public-sector credit unions ... Those have announced very, very low interest-rate loans to bridge people over the gap.""
So, more debt? More interest payments? That’s the solution? No. Those are the last things most Americans need. It was an idiotic thing to say. Look for Wilbur Ross’s words to be aired every day for the next three years on OutletName. They know a propaganda win when they see one.
And it’s a shame. It’s also a distraction because it doesn’t change the fundamental nature of this crisis. Our borders remain vulnerable, and the stakes are higher than they’ve ever been, thanks to the chaos just south of them. Leaders who cared about the country would be staying up late trying to fix the problem. Democratic leaders are trying to make it worse. That’s the bottom line truth.
Adapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" on January 24, 2019.",1
2249,"USA Today","Newly released data from the California legislature are shedding light on the impact of a state law that aims to make it easier for immigrants, including those in the country illegally, to obtain visas.
“It’s fascinating,” Lucie Hollingsworth, director of legal services with YWCA said of the data, which have been exclusively obtained by The Desert Sun. “I was surprised at the level of detail.”
The data show the number of U Visa certification requests that police departments, sheriff’s departments and district attorneys throughout California approved and denied in 2016. The U Visa gives immigrants who are victims of a crime access to work permits and deportation relief — and the number of immigrants asking for the visa is rising quickly.
To receive a U Visa, law enforcement agencies need to certify that the immigrant crime victim is cooperating in the investigation before U.S. Customs and Immigration Services can process the visa application. This certification is a small part of a process that is ultimately approved by USCIS but, historically, law enforcement officers haven't always responded or signed off on the requests, even when the immigrant crime victims cooperate.
Data from the California state Senate show some law enforcement agencies have arbitrary deadlines for applying for the visa, for example, some won’t accept a request based on a crime that happened longer than one year ago. And some agencies will refuse to certify the requests for certain types of crimes the immigrants may have faced, like simple battery or vandalism. Advocates argue that those decisions should be made by USCIS instead of local law enforcement agencies.
“What this report tells me is that the law is still being applied inconsistently and I think, as an advocate, it really helps me be more targeted in training,” Hollingsworth said.
California’s new law, Immigrant Victims of Crime Equity Act, requires U Visa certifiers to respond to requests within 90 days. It also created the presumption of helpfulness, meaning that unless there is evidence to the contrary, the assumption is that immigrants applying for the visa were helpful in the investigation.
There are no enforcement mechanisms built into the law. However, U Visa certifiers are legally obligated to submit annual records of the number of applicants they received, approved and denied. These records serve as the oversight, said Alison Kamhi, a staff attorney with the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.
“We are very interested in seeing what those numbers are to see if there are any law enforcement agencies that have a high denial rate because that is someone we would like to target for education,” she added.
Legislative staffers are compiling reports from dozens of certifiers and shared some of that data with The Desert Sun.
Here is what we’ve found:
•The 36 law enforcement agencies whose records were obtained by the Desert Sun received 7,108 requests;
•In total, the agencies approved 5,356 requests and denied 1,489;
•The Los Angeles Police Department received the overwhelming majority of requests with 2,384;
•The average denial rate for the available data was 27.8%;
•The largest denial rate was the San Diego Police Department, with 41.73% of U Visa requests denied.
Demand for U Visa
Since President Trump vowed to deport millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally, lawyers and advocates have been keeping an eye on the cooperation between local and federal law enforcement. The general consensus is that in order to achieve mass deportation goals, federal immigration officers will need the help of local police officers and sheriff’s deputies in identifying and detaining deportable immigrants.
The U Visa is distinct in that it requires a different type of cooperation between local law enforcement and the federal government. In this case, they help each other give legal status and work permits to immigrants who are victims of a crime.
The visa serves as a form of community policing by encouraging victims to speak out and cooperate with the police without fear of deportation, something their abusers use to keep them silent.
“I’m not exaggerating, 100% of the clients that come to me who are undocumented said that their abusers would constantly say, ‘I’m going to have you deported if you don’t behave,’” said Hollingsworth.
Other threats include: “You are never going to see your American-born children ever again. I’m going to call ICE and they are going to pick you up. Don’t call the police because they are going to pick you up, they are not going to come after me,” she added.
The demand of U Visas has increased dramatically throughout the country in the last decade, according to data from U.S. Customs and Immigration Services.
Between the 2009 and 2016 fiscal years, the number of people who applied for a U Visa grew from 10,000 to 60,000 and the number of people on the wait list skyrocketed from 21,000 to more than 150,000, USCIS data show.
With the current cap of 10,000 approvals plus their family members each year, it will take at least 15 years to clear the wait list, and that’s without taking into account new applicants. Applicants on the wait list who would have otherwise been approved for a U Visa are able to receive temporary work permits.
Signs of success
The San Diego Police Department has the highest denial rate, 41%, out of every agency whose records were released to the Desert Sun.
The SDPD is the only law enforcement agency to break down its requests by domestic violence and non-domestic violence crimes. Out of the 357 requests, 163 were requested by domestic violence victims.
Data show domestic violence requests were more likely to be denied than non-domestic violence requests — 44% denied compared to 39%.
Advocates who follow the Immigrant Victim Act say San Diego has historically been known for being hard to get a U Visa certification, so they are not surprised to see the high denial rates. However, the fact that they are approving more than half of applicants is a positive sign.
""They are going in the right direction,"" Hollingsworth said.
Beyond the data, lawyers have called the law successful for encouraging more immigrants to apply for the visas.
“People aren’t as scared to come forward,” said Casey Martin, a lawyer based in King County and a former prosecutor in Fresno County. The Fresno Police Department received 363 U Visa certification requests and approved 284. “One of the things I’ve noticed at least before the law, the abuser would say if you come forward you are going to be deported. The law has removed that because the minute they talk to a lawyer we can tell them not to worry.”
Another area where lawyers have noticed change is in education, specifically more clarity on what is required from officials who certify U Visas.
“It has been an overwhelming success,” said Kamhi, the immigration attorney. “A lot of it has been about education. About a year ago, the ACLU and other organizations sent out letters to all the district attorneys of the state and police departments in 30 cities with the highest population explaining the law and its new requirements.” ",0
385,"Breitbart","Democrat Presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris spoke at a rally at UC Irvine Wednesday, calling on Congress to pass a “clean” DACA amnesty bill, with no enforcement measures attached. The Orange County Register reports the freshman Senator from California, a favorite among progressives for 2020, addressed a crowd of approximately 200 supporters characterizing President Trump’s criterion for reforming DACA as “mean-spirited:” “This is about a fight for the future of this country, believing in the values upon which this country was founded,” Harris said. … “The path right now is rocky. It is difficult. It is hard,” Harris said. “We are witnessing things that we can only describe as awful and wrong, and mean-spirited. But that’s OK … Because we know this is about doing the right thing. We know this is about all the young people, who were brought here, some before they could walk or talk.” Harris was loudly cheered by the heavily immigrant crowd of roughly 200, while about 15 counter-demonstrators shouted their opposition to new provisions for those in the country illegally as well as their opposition to Harris. Harris is “clearly seen as an ally by most on hand Wednesday, including the clergy, faculty and DACA students — a blend of Koreans and Latinos,” according to the OC Register. The event was choreographed to pressure the region’s Rep. Mimi Walters, R-Laguna Beach, to sign on and co-sponsor the current version of the Dream Act introduced by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R- S.C., and Richard Durbin, D-Ill. Harris touted her co-sponsorship of the measure, which purports to give “permanent legal status to those covered by DACA and a path to citizenship for those in college, the military or who are otherwise employed.” Her message resonated with those present according to the OC Register article, sparking similar expressions of personal outrage at Trump’s ideas on immigration and particularly DACA reform: “We did not migrate to this country to sabotage this land, but to prosper with it,” said Ming Jun “Jenny” Park, a DACA recipient and fourth-year psychological major. While other leading Democrats including Senate Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a joint statement flatly dismissing all Trump’s reform “principles”, they claim they’re open to “reasonable border security measures.” Pelosi was shouted down at her own event last month in her native San Francisco by hardcore progressives and open-border socialists when she expressed essentially the same position about border security—which the activists consider “selling out.”  To this rising hard left socialist movement, which goes by names like “Indivisible”, any acknowledgment of the border is tantamount to endorsing oppression. This forced Pelosi to step up her anti-Trump rhetoric as she doubled down at a Capitol Hill press event Wednesday: They call them principles — unprinciples! —  they are not principles, they are trash — are unacceptable to the dreamers and those of us who fight for them. Trump’s “principles?” OutletName News summarized Trump’s goal using the President’s own words: Immigration reform must create more jobs, higher wages, and greater security for Americans — now and for future generations.

247,"FoxNews","California is likely to sue President Trump over his emergency declaration to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, the state attorney general said Friday.
Attorney General Xavier Becerra and Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, told reporters there is no emergency at the border and Trump doesn't have the authority to make the declaration.
""No one in America is above the law, not even the president of the United States,"" Becerra said. ""The president does not have power to act frivolously.""
TRUMP SCOLDS OutletName'S ACOSTA AS ANGEL MOMS CONFRONT REPORT OVER 'AGENDA'
Trump declared a national emergency earlier in the day to bypass Congress to use money from the Pentagon and counterdrug efforts to fulfill his promise of completing the border wall. The president said immigrants entering the U.S. illegally were invading the country.
TRUMP DECLARES EMERGENCY AT BORDER
The announcement was immediately met with resistance from members of Congress. Becerra and Newsom said they were reviewing the emergency declaration but were likely to join other states in suing. They did not say when the state plans to file a lawsuit or what specific legal arguments it will use.
But both challenge the notion that there was a true emergency. Becerra said past presidents used such declarations after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the Iran hostage crisis in 1979.
Becerra pointed to Trump's comments earlier in the day that he did not need to issue the emergency declaration but was doing so to accelerate plans for his border wall. He suggested Trump hopes any legal challenges will ultimately be determined by the U.S. Supreme Court. Five of the court's 9 members were appointed by Republican presidents.
""He knows he will lose in court and that he is hoping to use the U.S. Supreme Court as a tool in his game to fulfill a campaign promise,"" Becerra said.
Newsom argued Trump's plan to use money on the border wall that had been dedicated for military installations and combating drugs would hurt California.
Newsom on Monday signed an executive order to pull most of California's 360 National Guard troops from the Southern border but said 100 will remain there to help federal officials combating transnational drug crime.
""Interdiction policies we are engaged in that we want to advance in California now are being put at risk because of this political crisis that's being manufactured,"" Newsom said.
Building a wall, he argued, will not stop the flow of illegal drugs that come across ports of entry in vehicles or by other means.
Becerra has filed at least 45 lawsuits against the Trump administration.",1
1383,"WSJ","The Trump administration moved to dramatically limit Central American migrants’ ability to seek asylum at the U.S. border with Mexico, an escalation of the president’s push to stem the flood of border crossers that is severely straining the U.S. immigration system. Under the rule published online on Monday, with limited exceptions, migrants who pass through another country first must seek asylum there rather than at the U.S. border, where they will be ineligible to do so. The vast majority of asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border come from Central America, passing through Mexico, and in some cases Guatemala, first. The rule, issued by the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security, takes effect Tuesday. Trump officials said the Immigration and Nationality Act gives the attorney general the authority to set new limitations on who can seek asylum. Immigrant-rights groups pledged to challenge the new rule in court, arguing it is inconsistent with another portion of the same statute. That section generally allows people to request asylum when they arrive at the U.S., with some exceptions, including those coming through a country deemed “safe” pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement. The U.S. currently has only one such pact, known as a safe-third-country agreement, and that is with Canada. “The Trump administration is trying to unilaterally reverse our country’s legal and moral commitment to protect those fleeing danger,” said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the immigrants’ rights program at the American Civil Liberties Union. “This new rule is patently unlawful and we will sue.” Senior officials in President Trump’s administration have said the surge of families from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador fleeing gang violence and poverty for asylum in the U.S. has pushed the nation’s border-security infrastructure beyond its capacity. Officials noted that only a small number of asylum seekers are ultimately granted asylum and said the new rule is also meant to alleviate the strain from a large number of meritless asylum claims. Kevin McAleenan, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement: “Today’s action will reduce the overwhelming burdens on our domestic system caused by asylum seekers failing to seek urgent protection in the first available country, economic migrants lacking a legitimate fear of persecution, and the transnational criminal organizations, traffickers, and smugglers exploiting our system for profits.” “We understand that the U.S. asylum system is under significant strain. And we are ready to play a constructive role if needed in helping alleviate this strain,” U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said. But, he added, the measure “will put vulnerable families at risk. It will undermine efforts by countries across the region to devise the coherent, collective responses that are needed.” Tens of thousands of Central American families and unaccompanied children have arrived monthly in the past year, and nearly all have said they intend to apply for asylum. Although the number of people caught crossing the border illegally has declined in the last month, Border Patrol agents are likely to continue to see thousands of such migrants for the rest of the summer, most of whom would be affected by the new asylum rule. It isn’t fully clear what will happen to Central American migrants who seek asylum starting Tuesday. As has been the case for other asylum seekers, they will most likely be released into either the U.S. or Mexico with an order that they appear at a future asylum hearing, where the new rule could come into consideration. The new rule wouldn’t affect the roughly 20,000 mostly Central American asylum seekers in Mexico awaiting U.S. court dates. It also contains exceptions for people denied asylum in another country or victims of human trafficking. U.S. and Guatemalan officials were due to discuss a safe-third-country agreement on Monday, but President Jimmy Morales of Guatemala abruptly canceled after Guatemala’s Constitutional Court issued an injunction late Sunday night prohibiting him from signing such a pact. Monday’s proposed rule change comes a month after Mexico and the U.S. reached an agreement under which Mexico pledged to step up efforts to stem the surge of Central American migration in return for the U.S. not imposing broad tariffs on Mexican imports. As part of that deal, Mexico agreed to review its efforts after 45 days, and if they were judged to be insufficiently effective, to consider another solution to the problem, including signing a safe-third-country agreement with the U.S. Mexico’s foreign secretary, Marcelo Ebrard, said Monday that he didn’t consider the Trump administration’s change to asylum rules a violation of that agreement. “Mexico defends and has another legal system and another approach to asylum,” Mr. Ebrard said. “We don’t see this as a violation of some sort of bilateral agreement.” Meanwhile, Mexican authorities and civil-society groups have been grappling with a surge of migrants stranded in towns on the Mexican side of the U.S. border as a result of the tougher measures already implemented by the Trump administration. A metering system instituted by the administration has allowed only a limited number of asylum seekers to request asylum every day, forcing the rest to stay in Mexico for weeks or months until their numbers are called. And some of those who manage to request asylum then return to Mexico to await their hearings in U.S. immigration court. The asylum cases sometimes take months or years to finish. Some 18,700 asylum seekers are on metering lists in Mexican border towns, according to estimates from the Robert Strauss Center at the University of Texas at Austin. In addition, there are the roughly 20,000 asylum seekers who have been sent back to Mexico to await court dates in the U.S. The vast majority come from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Cuba. Even as more asylum seekers turn up, the number of migrants allowed to request asylum at U.S. ports of entry under this system has slowed down significantly in recent weeks, according to Mexican migration officials and rights activists. In the past, U.S. authorities took as many as 130 people on a daily basis. “Now, two or three days would pass without allowing anyone in, and migrants get desperate,” said Rogelio Pinal, head of the human rights unit of the border city of Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. There, local authorities, volunteers and migrant shelter workers are scrambling to cope with the swelling numbers. In the past, migrants would spend just a few days in shelters before resuming their trek north. Now, foreign asylum seekers face stays that could extend for months, if not years, says the Rev. Javier Calvillo, a Catholic priest who runs the church-backed Casa del Migrante shelter. “Most of them return [from trying to request asylum] defeated, starving and in crisis,” he said. About half of them try to get in touch with human smugglers known as coyotes to try their luck again—this time via illegal means. At the Buen Pastor shelter run by Methodist pastor Juan Fierro, dozens of migrant families push aside the wooden benches of his temple to sleep on the floors. He is now planning to boost capacity by adapting a warehouse across the street. While U.S. authorities initially returned mostly Central American adult males to wait in Mexico, now they are returning growing numbers of single mothers with children, pregnant women and minors with health conditions, say local officials and migrant volunteers. However dire the migrants’ situation is on both sides of the border, signs have emerged that the U.S.’s campaign of pressure on the Mexican government has borne results. Under the deal that averted a threat of punitive U.S. tariffs on Mexican imports, Mexico agreed in early June to deploy thousands of members of its newly created National Guard to stem the surge in migration from Central America to the U.S. As a result, Mexico sharply increased detentions of migrants seeking to illegally cross the border into the U.S. in June, hitting a record just weeks after the bilateral agreement was signed. Mexico’s efforts were also a big factor in the 28% drop that month in U.S. arrests of people crossing illegally or requesting asylum at ports of entry. At the Annunciation House shelter in El Paso, Texas, the largest shelter for migrants in the U.S., the number of arrivals has dropped to 600 a week from as many as 6,000 a week in the first three months of 2018, says Rubén García, the shelter’s director.",0
799,"Daily Caller","Former Vice President Al Gore said the recent Central American migrant caravans seeking asylum in the U.S. were fleeing the ravages of global warming.
Gore said the so-called “dry corridor,” which includes El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, “is the most vulnerable region in the world to global warming.”
“And they’ve gone without a harvest this year. Some have gone without a harvest for two years,” Gore told OutletName’s Christiane Amanpour in an interview Wednesday. “That is one of the principal causes for them making that long journey.”
Thousands of Central American migrants have joined caravans headed for the U.S.-Mexico border in order to seek asylum. Most experts see them as economic migrants, coming to the U.S. for work, not fleeing global warming. This isn’t the first time Gore linked global warming to recent migrant caravans. In December, Gore called the caravans a “recent, startling example” of global warming forcing people to flee their homes.
However, Gore is not the first to label the caravans “climate refugees.” It’s part of a broader media narrative to link the thousands joining U.S.-bound caravans to global warming.
For example, OutletName ran a story in October citing alleged experts who “say the big picture is that changing climate is forcing farmers off their land and it’s likely to get worse.”
That same month, The OutletName said the migrant caravan “foreshadows” what’s to come with global warming. And E&E News called the caravan a “preview of climate migrations,” that is, people driven from their homes due to man-made global warming.
Conflict scholars have largely debunked many of the claims linking global warming to armed conflict and migration.
To stem the tide of migrants, Gore said the U.S. needs to bring more economic and job security to Central America and work with the region’s governments “so they are not driven away from their homes.”",1
757,"Daily Caller","President Trump continued to promote his plan to end birthright citizenship during his rally in Estero, Florida on Wednesday night.
“The Democrats want to continue giving automatic birthright citizenship to every child born to an illegal alien. Even if they’ve been on our soil for a matter of seconds. Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrant children are made automatic citizens every year because of this crazy policy and they are instantly eligible for every privilege and benefit of American citizenship at a cost of billions of dollars a year,” Trump stated.
“That’s what it costs — billions. Back before the [Democratic] Party went crazy they also opposed this practice. Harry Reid said ‘no sane country,’ ‘no sane country’ would grant automatic citizenship to children of illegal immigrants — that’s what he said before he went crazy,” he continued. The president recently raised the issue during an interview with Axios’ Jonathan Swan on Monday night. During the interview, Trump explained that he doesn’t believe there is a need for a constitutional amendment to overturn birthright citizenship. Despite the president’s claim, many have said that an executive order would not be sufficient to overturn it.
“Under this policy anyone who breaks into the country and has a child the very next moment that child would be made a citizen for life. Great. This policy has even created an entire industry of birth tourism,” Trump added. “Big business, where pregnant mothers travel to America to make their children instant American citizens. Congress has never passed a law requiring birthright citizenship for illegal aliens and the Constitution does not, and I say that to the media, does not require it — read it — because illegal aliens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.”

2408,"Reuters","U.S. officials have initiated deportation proceedings against a Mexican immigrant with a work permit who was arrested near Seattle last week, alleging he has gang ties, according to a court filing from the Justice Department on Thursday. Daniel Ramirez Medina, 23, was taken into custody last week at his father’s home near Seattle by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, according to a lawsuit he filed challenging his detention. The lawsuit said he was brought to the United States illegally as a child and given a work permit during the administration of former President Barack Obama. Ramirez’s lawyers have filed court papers denying that he has any gang involvement or criminal record and saying he should not have been targeted for deportation. Ramirez’s lawyers have said this could be the first time under U.S. President Donald Trump that a person covered by a policy known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) has been taken into immigration custody. DACA, established by Obama in 2012, allows those brought to the country while young to attend school and work. The program protects from deportation some 750,000 people who were brought to the United States illegally as children and are sometimes called “dreamers,” in reference to the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) legislation that failed to pass. Immigration officers last week arrested more than 680 people in the country illegally, with the broad enforcement action alarmed immigrant rights groups. At a press conference on Thursday, Trump promised that his administration would “deal with DACA with heart.” He said the issue was a tough one because, while a majority of those benefiting from the program are “absolutely incredible kids,” others are “gang members, and they’re drug dealers, too.” The Justice Department’s Thursday filing said ICE officers questioned Ramirez about a “gang tattoo” on his forearm. But Ramirez’s lawyers, in a separate court filing on Thursday, said ICE has launched a public campaign to smear Ramirez. The tattoo on Ramirez’s forearm had a nautical star and the name of his birthplace, the filing said, which had nothing to do with any gang. ICE agents asked “five to seven times” whether Ramirez was in a gang, and he denied it each time, the filing said. Additionally, the filing said, immigration officers removed words from a written statement by Ramirez denying gang involvement to make it sound as if he was admitting gang affiliation. The Justice Department asserted that a Seattle federal judge has no legal basis to consider Ramirez’s lawsuit because ICE has initiated deportation proceedings to be adjudicated in a separate administrative court. Ramirez’s attorneys say the issue before the Seattle court is an illegal arrest and detention, not an immigration matter. Ramirez has asked the judge to order his release immediately. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday.",0
1384,"WSJ","Pedro Luis Ruiz was tantalizingly close to an asylum interview after waiting months at the U.S. border. American officials were just a few hundred numbers away from calling his—12,346. Then the rules changed. On Tuesday, about two dozen immigrants were allowed by U.S. authorities to cross the U.S.-Mexico border and request asylum at key ports of entry in Texas and California, a day after the Trump administration said that asylum seekers who pass through a third country must first apply for refugee status there rather than the U.S. U.S. immigration officials were grappling with how to carry out a policy that seeks to effectively close the border to the vast majority of the 18,700 asylum seekers on Mexico’s side of the border. Most of them have traveled from Central America and Cuba. “President Trump has the right to think as he wishes, but in this case he is wrong,” said Mr. Ruiz, a Cuban activist who joined an underground opposition party and says he cannot return to Cuba for fear of political persecution. “I will not feel protected anywhere in the world other than the U.S.” The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of civil-rights and immigration groups on Tuesday challenging the new rules. The suit calls them “an unlawful effort to significantly undermine, if not virtually repeal, the U.S. asylum system at the southern border, and cruelly closes our doors to refugees fleeing persecution.” Starting last year, such asylum seekers tried to enter the U.S. to apply for asylum and were instead given a number and told to wait in Mexico for an asylum interview. Since border crossings were overwhelmed with growing numbers of Central American migrants, U.S. officials said they had to implement a metering system, allowing only a few dozen migrants a day to hold an interview with an asylum officer—the first step in gaining asylum—to clear them for an immigration court hearing. If the new rule withstands legal challenges, thousands of Central Americans will have to seek asylum from the first country they crossed on their way to the U.S.—Guatemala and Mexico in many cases. They include Mr. Ruiz, who has taken refuge at the Good Pastor migrant shelter run by a Methodist pastor, Rev. Juan Fierro. “This rule will make things increasingly difficult. There are thousands of people in Ciudad Juárez asking for asylum in the U.S., and this is a way to say: Don’t even come,” said Lucero de Alva, a volunteer who assists migrant women and children in coordination with state authorities and Evangelical groups. “You have people here who have been waiting for three months. They left everything behind to come to request asylum in the U.S.,” said Ms. De Alva, who recently opened a school for 26 migrant children stranded in Ciudad Juárez. Since only about 20% of asylum claims are eventually approved in court, according to government figures, the Trump administration says the clear majority are spurious claims. Nearly half are denied but the rest are either not decided, abandoned or withdrawn. But in the meantime, many asylum applicants have been living and working in the U.S. To address that, the Trump administration has also sent back some 20,000 migrants to Mexico under a program known as Remain in Mexico to wait while their asylum claims make their way through U.S. courts—a process that takes months or years. That group won’t be affected by the new rule. Experts said Mexico is unprepared for such a sharp increase in asylum claims. Mexico’s refugee agency, with a $1.2 million annual budget, is already swamped by asylum requests expected to total 60,000 this year. Guatemala has almost no capacity of its own to receive asylum seekers, said Adam Isacson, an expert on security and migration at the Washington Office on Latin America, a think tank. Mexico’s asylum agency doesn’t even have an office in Ciudad Juárez. That means a lengthy process for asylum seekers stranded in Ciudad Juárez like Mr. Ruiz, because his case would be processed in Mexico City, said Edith Tapia, policy research analyst at the Hope Border Institute, a grass-roots organization based in El Paso. Along the border, Mexican migrant shelters are overcrowded with people like Mr. Ruiz, placing a heavy burden on government agencies and charity groups. In his nine years running the largest migrant shelter in this border city, the Rev. Javier Calvillo was used to receiving migrants for just a few days. Many were Mexican migrants who had been deported from the U.S. They would spend one or two nights before taking a bus back home. Central American migrants would also come for a couple of days, seeking to regain strength before trying to make a final, and tricky effort to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. Now, Rev. Calvillo’s shelter is full, packed with hundreds of stranded migrants, including large families, with no prospect of leaving any time soon. “We have not been prepared for this new reality: asylum seekers who are likely to be here waiting for their court dates until next year,” Rev. Calvillo said on a recent day in the offices of the House of the Migrants shelter, which is backed by the Catholic Church. Dozens of children played in the backyard. “They come back with intense emotional pain. They would ask: What do I do here on my own, without my family?” Rev. Calvillo said. “There’s not much you can offer to these returnees facing the prospect of an eight-month stay.” With a capacity to host some 1,000 migrants, the shelter is now facing significant challenges to pay its monthly utility bills, including more than $5,000 for cooking gas, $6,300 for running water and $2,600 in long-distance calls so migrants can be in touch with their relatives, he said. Ciudad Juárez is also a temporary home to nearly 9,000 of the 20,000 migrants who have been sent back to Mexico to await their hearings in U.S. immigration court under the Remain in Mexico program. The majority of those are from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Many are single mothers with children, pregnant women, and minors with health problems. “We have had to deal with a situation that we didn’t create, and from the beginning we didn’t have a say in migration policy decisions,” said Enrique Valenzuela, head of the agency in charge of migration assistance for the state of Chihuahua, where Ciudad Juárez is located. “Under the Remain in Mexico program, the number of returnees is increasing scandalously, and this is what overwhelms us. The U.S. is returning as many as 200 migrants a day.”",0
612,"Daily Caller","Border Patrol agents know exactly what they want in a border wall, and every mile varies.
Immigration experts tell OutletName that President Donald Trump’s vision for a border barrier is informed directly by the requests of Border Patrol agents.
Trump tweeted one day before the partial government shutdown that he was looking into building a “steel slat barrier” that is “totally effective.” The tweet sparked endless media stories and mockery about how Trump was backing down on his campaign promise of a concrete border wall.
A design of our Steel Slat Barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful!
“Whatever you want to call it, it’s all the same,” Trump also said, seemingly softening his stance on the “wall” amid efforts to make a deal with Democrats.
Immigration experts, however, tell OutletName that Trump has embraced new ideas about what kinds of barriers will be effective on the border after viewing various prototypes and speaking directly with Border Patrol agents on the ground. They also make clear that Trump’s newfound focus on “steel slats” does not mean that a concrete wall is now completely obsolete.
There is “not a one-size-fits-all” approach to a border barrier, former acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) director Thomas Homan told TheDC in a phone interview.
“There are different types depending on the terrain,” Homan explained, adding that steel slats are one of many options because “guys on the ground like the option of seeing through the other side.”
One person familiar with the administration’s border policy similarly made clear that proposed barriers are “not uniform” across the border. and are dependent on what Border Patrol agents say they require in their respective zones.
For example, areas near the Rio Grande river that are prone to flooding may require a concrete wall similar to Trump’s original campaign proposal, while drier areas like Calexico, California would be better served by a fence. The height of physical barriers would also vary depending on how highly trafficked border sections are.
Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan noted in an interview on OutletName’s “This Week” that the $5 billion the president is requesting in the shutdown battle would pay for more than just “a dumb barrier.”
“It’s about 215 miles of wall system,” McAleenan said, adding that the money would also pay for technology such as censors, lighting and cameras.
Democrats have seized on Trump’s tweet about steel slats to accuse him of breaking his campaign promises about the wall. House Minority Leader and soon-to-be Speaker Nancy Pelosi joked last week that Trump’s wall has turned into a “beaded curtain.”
While the president scoffed at the idea of his wall being conflated with a fence during the 2016 presidential campaign, administration officials and immigration experts now say that the wall is a euphemism for any type of border barrier.
“The wall is a barrier. The president’s words are being taken out of context,” Homan asserted. “Democrats don’t have a good argument against a border wall, so they pick on the president’s terminology … Democrats are refusing to fund a barrier because they don’t want Trump to win.”
“There may be a wall at some places, there may be steel slats, there may be technological enhancements,” White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said in a recent “OutletName Sunday” interview. “But always saying ‘wall’ or ‘no wall’ is being very disingenuous.”
Former Chief of Staff John Kelly knocked Trump’s wall in an exit interview with The OutletName, stating, “To be honest, it’s not a wall.”
Kelly also admitted, however, that the shift away from a concrete wall is primarily due to the administration asking “people what they needed and where they needed it” rather than the president shamelessly giving up on a campaign promise.
“To be honest, it’s not a wall,” Kelly said. “The president still says ‘wall’ — oftentimes frankly he’ll say ‘barrier’ or ‘fencing.’ Now, he’s tended toward steel slats. But we left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.”",1
2491,"Reuters","U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that raids over the weekend aimed at immigrants who had been ordered deported were “very successful” even though much of the activity was not visible to the public. Trump had vowed to launch mass deportation roundups over the weekend, causing immigrants and their advocates to brace for large numbers of arrests, but by Sunday evening there were only reports of low-profile operations in a few cities. “The ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids were very successful,” Trump told reporters at a White House event. “People came into our country illegally ... Many were felons. Many were convicted of crimes.” “Many, many were taken out on Sunday - you just didn’t know about it. ... It was a very successful day but you didn’t see a lot of it. ... Every person taken out had papers and we had court orders,” Trump added, without offering any evidence to support his statement. Reporting over the weekend suggested the ICE raids were narrower in scope than had been anticipated. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said there were three ICE operations in his city on Saturday. There were unconfirmed reports of ICE actions in Denver and Miami. “We are doing targeted enforcement actions against specific individuals who have had their day in immigration court and have been ordered removed by an immigration judge,” Acting ICE Director Matt Albence told OutletName on Sunday when asked for an update. Mary Bauer at the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) said there were no confirmed operations in large Southern cities such as Atlanta. There also were no reports of arrests from the American Immigration Council, which has lawyers on standby to give legal advice at the country’s largest family migrant detention center in Dilley, Texas. The removal operations are meant to deter a surge in Central American families seeking asylum in the United States after fleeing poverty and gang violence in their home countries. The Trump administration said on Monday it was implementing new rules for immigrants seeking asylum, requiring them to first seek protection from a third country.",0
1435,"WSJ","President Trump in his better moments has said he wants, and the U.S. needs, more legal immigrants. But that’s hard to square with the way his Administration is now trying to curtail legal immigration under the pretext of preventing America from becoming a welfare magnet. The Department of Homeland Security on Monday finalized a rule that ostensibly seeks to enforce and clarify the Immigration and Nationality Act. That law bars immigrants from gaining admission, renewing visas or obtaining green cards if they are “likely at any time to become a public charge.” Congress didn’t define “public charge” beyond such general categories as age, health, family and financial status, assets, education and skills. In 1999 the Clinton Administration issued guidance defining a “public charge” as an individual likely to become “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance, or institutionalization for long-term care at government expense.” Excluded were noncash benefits like Medicaid and food stamps, which consume a growing share of government welfare spending. The Trump Administration now wants to incorporate noncash benefits into “public charge” determinations to prevent immigrants from coming to the U.S. to live on the dole. This makes sense as a general principle. Public support for immigration will erode as it has in Europe if Americans perceive immigrants as a government burden. But there’s little evidence that immigrants are free-riding, and the DHS rule cedes too much discretion to bureaucrats over immigration decisions. Start with DHS’s declaration that it will weigh the “totality of the alien’s circumstances” and that “no single factor alone, including the receipt of public benefits, is outcome determinative.” So immigration officers will apply the kind of holistic admission reviews that colleges now use—except adversity will be considered a negative. Anyone who has been “approved to receive one or more public benefits for more than 12 months within any 36-month period” would receive an automatic negative strike. But most immigrants don’t qualify for most public benefits until they have lived in the country for at least five years. Thus DHS is directing immigration officers in the 837-page rule to project the likelihood that immigrants might someday become a “public charge” based on arbitrary levels of income, employment, education and English proficiency. Earning more than 250% of the federal poverty line ($30,350 for an individual) would be a “heavily weighted positive factor,” for example. Yet the U.S. has about four million foreign-born workers with less than a high-school diploma who earn on average $27,820 per year. They hold vital jobs across the economy that there aren’t enough citizens to fill. Current earnings also don’t predict income growth or government dependency. According to the National Foundation for American Policy, incomes of immigrants ages 26 to 40 after a mere four years in the U.S. rose to 300% from 239% of the poverty line—nearly the average of native-born counterparts. While immigrants are no more likely than native-born Americans to use public benefits, they are more likely to work. The labor participation rate of Hispanic foreign-born high-school graduates (72.2%) is comparable to white native-born bachelor’s degree recipients (72.7%) and significantly higher than native-born whites with merely a high-school education (53.8%). (See the nearby table.) All of this makes the new rule vulnerable to legal challenges. While supposedly trying to flesh out a vague statute, DHS is essentially rewriting immigration law on its own. And wouldn’t you know, the rule bears a striking resemblance to the “merit-based” system that restrictionists in the White House have proposed but can’t get Congress to pass. If this sounds like Barack Obama’s legislate-by-rule strategy on climate change, that’s because it is. We support work requirements for public benefits, and they make sense as part of immigration reform that allows more workers to enter the country legally based on economic demand. But the White House has proposed nothing to expand legal immigration, skilled or unskilled, and all of its recent proposals seem intended to reduce any and all immigration, legal or illegal. The DHS rule might even drive more folks who are deemed “public charges” to come illegally. The rule looks like one more attempt by White House adviser Stephen Miller to make America a country of no more immigrants.",0
551,"Breitbart","Many mainstream news outlets appear to be purposely and dishonestly overlooking key facts about the U.S.-Mexico border region in order to push a false narrative about a safe border.
OutletName Border and Cartel Chronicles Director Brandon Darby took on the recent reporting by OutletName’s Jim Acosta and some social media postings by Texas Democrat Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke, where they try to claim the border, is safe. Darby’s statements were part of his recent interview with OutletName News Tonight.
In the case of Jim Acosta, Darby criticized the OutletName correspondent video report where he stands next to the border fence claiming the area is safe. What Acosta did not report on was the constant gun battles in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, just south of his location. He also did not report that just one day before, authorities in Mexico discovered 17 charred bodies in the town of Miguel Aleman — an area about 60 miles west of where he was standing.
“For him to do that, is so dishonest, it is outright propaganda,” Darby said.
Darby also spoke about social media postings by O’Rourke who continually claims that the whole border is safe.
“Well there are some places along the border that are safe like El Paso,” Darby stated. “They are safe because there is a wall, there is already a steel barrier there. In contrast. in Ciudad Juarez, the Mexican side of the El Paso- Juarez Metropolitan Area … it is one of the most violent places on earth. If you look at the murder rates since 2009 there, it’s insane”
In their effort to portray the border as a safe region, the politician and the OutletName journalist overlook the fact that the border region is not only the U.S. side but also the Mexican side of the border. These regions are home to some of the most violent cities in the world.
“For them to intentionally parse their words in a way to not have to mention the violence, death, and depravity that is happening within a kilometer from there — it is propaganda,” Darby said. “It is a Potemkin village they are setting up, it is dishonest, and it further silences the communities in Mexico. It further silences everything the migrants go through to get here, it further silences the more than 50,000 family members of the victims the cartels have disappeared. It further silences the further silences the approximately 200,000 who have been killed by the cartels in Mexico. It is not ok that they are doing this, it is propaganda. “
One of the most alarming trends in the way national news reported border issues dealt with the statement by U.S. President Donald Trump that one in three women were sexually assaulted in their journey to the border.
“What have we become as a nation? What are our media folks doing?” Darby asked, referring to how that statement was ignored by most news outlets.
“The president was wrong,” Darby pointed out. “He said one out of three women migrant women were raped on their journey from Central America to the border. That is the lowest estimate — most groups put it between 70 and 80 percent.”
The difference in estimates deals with only a fraction of the women actually admitting they were abused, while the rest continue to suffer in silence, he explained.
According to Darby, most of the groups that work with migrant women operate under the assumption that all of the women that reach the shelters have been raped at some point along their journey.
“The fact is, the president said in an address that tens of thousands of migrants women have been sexually assaulted on their way to the border and no one is paying attention to that,” Darby said. “The border is not just the U.S. side the border region. It is the U.S. and Mexico side and it has some of the most dangerous areas in the world, just by looking at the data.”
In regards to the coverage about authorities being able to cut through border fences as part of the testing, Darby explained that the apparent lack of a blue-collar background by the outlets reporting it possibly led to them failing to mention that the readily available “Sawzall” tool that was used to cut the fence was extremely loud and takes a long time to cut through the steel beams.
“There is no substance that we can put on the wall that someone can’t put dynamite or use a blow torch to get through,” Darby said. “That is why you need roads, cameras, and agents nearby so that when people try to compromise the integrity of the wall, the fencing, the agents can respond.”",1
653,"Daily Caller","The Supreme Court Friday sided with a Korean immigrant who faced deportation as a result of faulty legal advice he received from his criminal defense attorney.
In a 6-2 opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court explained that a decision to risk almost certain conviction at trial in hopes of avoiding deportation is reasonable. The opinion was joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissent joined by Justice Samuel Alito.
The case arose in 2009 when a lawful permanent resident named Jae Lee was arrested for possessing ecstasy with intent to distribute. Lee and his family immigrated to the United States when he was 13. He resided in the U.S. for over 20 years, operated two successful restaurants in the Memphis, Tenn. suburbs, and never returned to his native Korea.
After his arrest, Lee accepted a plea deal from federal prosecutors to serve 366 days in prison. Though he repeatedly expressed concerns to his lawyer about the prospect of deportation, he was assured that accepting the plea bargain would not result in his removal from the United States. The advice, however, was incorrect, and the government announced it would deport Lee at the conclusion of his prison sentence.
Lee sought to have his plea and conviction set aside for ineffective assistance of counsel. Lee argued avoiding deportation was the most important factor in his decision making, and that his choice to accept his lawyer’s advise turned on the assurance he would not be removed. The government countered that Lee could not show he had been prejudiced by his lawyer’s bad advise, because the evidence against him, overwhelming and incontrovertible, guaranteed a conviction and removal.
The Court disagreed with the government, finding that success at trial should not drive the inquiry. Roberts writes:
But common sense (not to mention our precedent) recognizes that there is more to consider than simply the likelihood of success at trial. The decision whether to plead guilty also involves assessing the respective consequences of a conviction after trial and by plea. When those consequences are, from the defendant’s perspective, similarly dire, even the smallest chance of success at trial may look attractive. For example, a defendant with no realistic defense to a charge carrying a 20-year sentence may nevertheless choose trial, if the prosecution’s plea offer is 18 years. Here Lee alleges that avoiding deportation was the determinative factor for him; deportation after some time in prison was not meaningfully different from deportation after somewhat less time. He says he accordingly would have rejected any plea leading to deportation—even if it shaved off prison time—in favor of throwing a “Hail Mary” at trial.
The opinion makes no mention of the possibility that Lee would seek to avoid deportation through the plea bargaining process itself. During oral arguments in March, Justice Kagan suggested that Lee could negotiate a plea entailing a longer jail sentence provided he was not removed from the United States.
The outcome was somewhat surprising, as Roberts himself seemed rather hostile to Lee’s position when the case was argued.
Writing in dissent, Justice Thomas warned the ruling would have “pernicious consequences for the criminal justice system.”
“The Court today provides no assurance that plea deals negotiated in good faith with guilty defendants will remain final,” he wrote.",1
2266,"USA Today","President Trump revived his rhetorical attacks Monday on Mexico, immigration, and the Democrats, even though illegal border crossings are down and the president himself killed off a key program at issue.
In a series of early morning tweets, Trump pronounced last rites on the Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals program, which is designed to shield the children of undocumented workers from deportation.
""DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon ... No longer works,"" Trump tweeted. ""Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!""
Yet Trump himself last year terminated the DACA program begun by predecessor Barack Obama, and in the months since has rejected various congressional proposals to re-create it.
Also, illegal immigration has declined in recent years, as Trump himself pointed out in a February tweet in which he lauded a ”45 year low on illegal border crossings this year.""
Echoing tweets on Easter Sunday, Trump called on the Republican-run Congress to ""immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People.""
He added, ""our country is being stolen!""
DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime! — Donald J. Trump () April 2, 2018
...Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People.

By ""nuclear option,"" Trump means eliminating the Senate filibuster rule that allows a party to hold up legislation unless proponents muster at least 60 votes in support.
While the Senate has eliminated the filibuster rule for confirmation votes on presidential appointees, Republican Senate leaders are loath to end it entirely because Democrats could use it against them in the future.

2243,"USA Today","Mayor Greg Stanton responded Thursday to calls for the city to defy state law on immigration issues, saying he wouldn't ask local police officers to do what activists say it will take to make Phoenix a sanctuary city.
Stanton responded in a statement to a citizen petition presented to the City Council on Wednesday asking to change Phoenix Police Department policy and stop cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. While no exact definition exists of a sanctuary city, local activists have said it requires ending a department policy regarding immigration enforcement.
Though community groups have for weeks escalated their calls for Stanton to change the policy, they aren't behind the petition the council expects to respond to on Feb. 15. It’s unclear how the item will appear on the council agenda, or if council members will take a vote.
Resident Rick Robinson filed the petition in response to President Trump’s Jan. 25 executive order penalizing sanctuary cities, or jurisdictions that ""willfully violate"" federal immigration laws.
Stanton called Robinson, a two-time Arizona state House of Representatives candidate, a “Republican political operative.” Robinson said he delivered the petition to spark a decision by the city and didn't know why he would ""be considered more than an ordinary Republican.""
Leaders of Puente Human Rights Movement​, a group pushing Phoenix to become a sanctuary city, said they didn't know about the Phoenix city charter rules regarding petitions. Executive Director Carlos Garcia said he thinks Robinson has political motivations, but that the petition serves Puente's goals.
“We would ask for the same stance to protect our families,” he said.
Stanton has spoken against the Trump administration's deportation plans and said Thursday that Phoenix will not participate in the 287(g) program to deputize local police to help federal immigration enforcement through agreements with agencies and jails.
But whether Phoenix can be a sanctuary city is dictated by state law, Stanton said. Phoenix police operate under the provisions of Arizona's Senate Bill 1070 that were upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Police policy prohibits officers from profiling people based on race, color or national origin to ask their immigration status. But they cooperate with federal immigration agencies in a variety of circumstances.
That includes making a “reasonable attempt” to determine the immigration status of a person stopped or detained in some situations, or transporting people with immigration violations in others.
“We must respect the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision and the rule of law — and I will not ask Phoenix police officers to knowingly violate the law,” Stanton said.
But Puente's Garcia said his organization won’t let Stanton talk “out of both sides of his mouth.”
Puente is encouraged by Stanton's opposition to the 287(g) program, Garcia said. Phoenix police, though, already are acting as a ""deportation force"" by complying with what remains of SB 1070, he said.
Puente is asking Stanton to defy state law and “do away with the status quo,” Garcia said.
Alessandra Soler, executive director of the ACLU of Arizona, said in a statement that Phoenix could improve its policing with a number of reforms conforming to current laws.
Those include updating policies regarding the questioning of students, crime victims, passengers and witnesses, and collecting data on the race of people who are stopped to prove unbiased policing, she said.
""We hope that Mayor Stanton and the Phoenix Police Department now act with the urgency they’ve lacked in recent years to protect Phoenix residents —immigrants or otherwise — from racial profiling and discriminatory immigration enforcement,"" she said. ",0
1210,"WSJ","Within days of President Trump’s executive order to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities, San Francisco had filed a lawsuit opposing the order, and the mayors of other cities with large immigrant populations—Los Angeles, Chicago, New York—had likewise vowed to defy the administration. In other words, everyone behaved as expected, which is the problem. There is no established legal definition of a sanctuary city, but the term usually refers to jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration officials to prevent illegal aliens from being deported. The order threatens to block federal funding to uncooperative cities, while the lawsuit argues that forcing cities to comply is a violation of states’ rights under the 10th Amendment. Defenders of sanctuary policies—including many law-enforcement officials—maintain that cities are safer when illegal immigrants are free to report crimes to police without fear of being deported. During the campaign, however, Mr. Trump vowed to end these renegade policies on the grounds, he said, that sanctuary cities are more prone to violent crime. In fact, empirical studies have long shown that the foreign-born, regardless of legal status and country of origin, are arrested and incarcerated at lower rates than their native-born counterparts. Net migration from Mexico has been zero or negative in recent years, and illegal border crossings are at their lowest point since the 1970s. Mr. Trump’s claim that illegal immigrants drive murders, rapes, assaults and other violent crime is also divorced from the reality that crime rates in the U.S. plummeted in recent decades even as illegal immigration soared. From the mid-1990s through the mid-2000s, the country’s undocumented population doubled to roughly 12 million. Over the same period violent crime in the U.S. fell by more than a third, and property crime dropped more than 25%, including in border cities like San Diego and El Paso, Texas, which are home to large numbers of illegal immigrants. Violent crime in the U.S., by and large, is homegrown, even if undocumented foreign nationals provide convenient scapegoats for politicians. Statistical evidence, however compelling, is often no match for a powerful anecdote. And in condemning sanctuary cities Mr. Trump has regularly invoked the tragic death of Kate Steinle, who was murdered in 2015 on a San Francisco pier by an illegal immigrant who had been convicted of numerous felonies and deported multiple times. If local law enforcement, who had the alleged assailant in custody, had complied with the federal government’s request to detain him until it could be determined whether he should be deported, Steinle might still be alive. Her death was a statistical aberration, but that’s of little comfort to her family and millions of other sympathetic Americans wondering why our immigration policies don’t seem to prioritize their safety. Which gets us back to the opponents of Mr. Trump’s executive order. Sanctuary cities are the exception, not the norm. Most jurisdictions readily comply with federal requests to assist in immigration enforcement. But it’s also true that the illegal immigrant population is concentrated in progressive strongholds such as Los Angeles and New York, where defiance of the new president is not only applauded but demanded. “Given their state’s demographic shift, California politicians have no incentive to work with Washington,” writes David DeVoss in the Weekly Standard. “Those who fail to muster sufficient outrage invite accusations of racism and bigotry.” California is home to about a quarter of the country’s 11 million illegal immigrants, he notes, and “Los Angeles remains a city where a Trump bumper sticker is an invitation to have your car keyed.” The liberals who run these deep-blue metropolises are dug in against the president. Nor is it certain that the sanctuary order will fare any better under court challenges than has the temporary travel ban. Last year, a federal judge in Illinois ruled that it was unconstitutional for the Department of Homeland Security to force local jails to detain suspected undocumented immigrants without a warrant. And in a 1997 Supreme Court decision, Printz v. U.S., a 5-4 majority held that the federal government “may neither issue directives requiring the States to address particular problems, nor command the States’ officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program.” Sanctuary cities are more of an effect than a cause of illegal immigration. The failure of the federal government to pass comprehensive reform has left states and cities fending for themselves. A provocative executive order might fulfill a campaign promise, but it won’t solve the underlying problem, which is an immigration system that is ill-equipped to serve the country’s economic and security needs in the 21st century. That will take legislation and leadership.",0

Given the inconsistent barrier in place now, residents could be forgiven for having a hard time visualizing the kind of epic construction feat Trump wants to achieve.
The U.S.-Mexico border, all told, stretches more than 1,900 miles from the coast of California to the southern tip of Texas. Right now, 654 miles of that has fencing of some kind.
The kind of fence varies from location to location.
The El Paso sector, for example, uses “post-on-rail” steel set in concrete in some sections and a steel mesh fence in others. In San Diego, a bollard fence with cantilever – the kind used for federal buildings – is in place. In Yuma, it’s a metal mesh fence.
But the landscape along the south Texas border is diverse and unlike parts of New Mexico, Arizona, California, it zig-zags through the river, and cuts through people’s backyards, farmers’ fields and even the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley campus.
“It’s really a totally stupid thing,” Cameron County Sherriff Omar Lucio told OutletNameNews.com of the current set-up. “It’s 10 feet high and has huge openings.”
Lucio, who is responsible for protecting a large swath of south Texas, says some border crossers skip the wall altogether and use the mouth of the Rio Grande River to raft across from Matamoros, Mexico -- something a border wall might not be able to stop, either.
Illegal immigrants also can take advantage of other gaps in the wall along terrain too tough or expansive to patrol regularly.
“Most agents are in favor of some sort of wall or fence, although a wall alone won’t make the country safer,” Jon Anfinsen, president of Local 2366 of the National Border Patrol Council, told OutletNameNews.com. “There are other sectors that will simply not support a wall because of the terrain, so a wall has to be combined with new technology and additional manpower to make the country safer.”
Anfinsen says while other sectors could support a wall on most or all of its border in their areas, his is “too hilly to feasibly make a wall on its entire stretch of border.”
The border fence was authorized under the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican-controlled Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. The legislation OK’d hundreds of miles of fencing along the Mexico border.
Since then, it’s been tweaked. Then-Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison pushed a measure that would give the Department of Homeland Security the authority to decide what type of fence should go up in different areas – the reason why there are so many different types of border barriers in place today.
As the border was being redrawn – in south Texas, it’s almost 2 miles north of the natural border of the Rio Grande River – people who had homes or businesses there paid the price.
Ray Loop’s family farm sits at the southernmost point along the border. Big, rusty 18-foot high steel bars courtesy of the federal government now dissect sections of it.
There are also gaps – lots of them, which border crossers use to make it over. Sometimes, they’ll hide in his citrus bushes waiting for the all clear. If that doesn’t work, they climb over on parts of the border that are lower.
“It takes them about a minute and a half to climb the wall,” he said.
Brownsville’s mayor showed OutletNameNews.com some of the holes in the wall. In one spot, the rust-colored bars end and a much shorter green fence begins. It’s easily traversable by migrant workers, asylum seekers, drug smugglers and human traffickers.
But Martinez says building a bigger, better wall like Trump has proposed won’t stop those determined to make it into U.S. territory.
Instead, he believes cross-border communication with Mexican authorities would go a long way toward cutting down on illegal immigration.
Cindy Johnson, a deaconess at United Methodist Women in Brownsville who works with illegal immigrants, agrees. As a lifelong resident of Brownsville, she urged Washington lawmakers against rushing to judgment on the benefits of a border wall.
“Lawmakers who’ve never even visited border communities shouldn’t be determining their futures,” Johnson told OutletNameNews.com.",1
1365,"WSJ","Fermín Campos arrived at the El Chaparral border crossing to the U.S. with 11 family members six weeks ago, well before a caravan of more than 5,000 Central Americans arrived in this city across the border from San Diego. On a notebook ledger organized and maintained by asylum seekers here to take orderly turns entering the U.S. to make their claims, Mr. Campos, a Mexican citizen, wrote the names of all the members of his large family and began waiting for his number to be called. The notebook—“el cuaderno” in Spanish—became a way of bringing order as thousands of migrants have come to the border to ask for asylum and the Trump administration has toughened its immigration stance, slowing down the asylum process. Now it is the center of rising tensions as the thousands of so-called caravan migrants have poured into Tijuana, overwhelming Mexican officials. As days of waiting have stretched into weeks, Mr. Campos and others in his predicament have grown increasingly concerned that the massive influx could disrupt the self-administered priority system at the border. He is trying to cross into the U.S. and make a new life after fleeing his hometown in the lawless Mexican state of Guerrero, where he said he received many threats from extortionists. “The caravan guys came here very aggressively...They wanted to impose their own rules,” said Mr. Campos, standing in a small plaza next to the U.S. port of entry. “They don’t want to go through this process. They just want to show up and cross.” U.S. immigration authorities said they coordinate with Mexican officials daily in deciding how many people they will allow to cross to the U.S. side of the border to ask for asylum. The U.S. entry port of San Ysidro, Calif., right across the border from El Chaparral, has space for 300 people and has been processing an average of about 100 asylum petitions each day. Customs and Border Protection officials say that after an initial review and interview with asylum petitioners, the goal is to move them within 72 hours from the facility’s basement holding cells to the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Before the migrant caravan arrived in Tijuana in mid-November, Mexican officials estimate, some 2,700 asylum seekers awaited entry, including Mexican nationals, Central Americans and between 30 to 40 Africans. After the caravan migrants arrived, they say, the waiting list grew to about 7,000 people. U.S. immigration authorities have said it could take as long as five weeks to clear the list of migrants who arrived before the caravan. Only then, they say, can they start addressing the claims of the Central Americans who came in the large and highly visible groups that have moved north through Mexico over the last few weeks. On Thursday, asylum seekers confronted a Peruvian man who had been helping oversee the waiting list, accusing him of adding three people to it before they had even entered Mexico. Also on Thursday, several Central American women who arrived in the caravan began a hunger strike to demand entry to the U.S. Last week, some caravan members tried to storm the U.S. border but were pushed back by CBP officers who dispersed tear gas from the U.S. side. Other asylum seekers have voiced concern that the tactics used by caravan migrants have threatened what had become an agreed-upon process of accessing the U.S. border. Abdul Savage, a 17-year-old from Sierra Leone, said the procedure has slowed since the migrant caravan showed up. “The caravan people, they are making it really difficult for us, the Africans,” he said. “They are looking for a better life, but also we too are looking for a better life.” Migration advocates say the U.S. admission process for asylum seekers is too restrictive. “There are 5,000 people here who are waiting for their turn to ask for asylum,” said David Abud, a Los Angeles-based immigration activist at a press conference in Tijuana. “So how long are they going to have to wait here, so that they can exercise a human right, which is petitioning asylum?” CBP officials say the number of asylum petitions they process daily varies based on case complexity, available resources, medical needs, translation requirements and holding or detention space, among other factors. Wilfredo Garach Orellana, a 41-year-old Honduran, said he was among the first to arrive with the caravan and has been in Tijuana for several weeks waiting his turn on the list. Mr. Orellana said life has become “ugly, real ugly” at the crowded, rain-flooded sports complex where the migrants have been encamped. On Thursday, Mexican officials began moving people to a new shelter—a disused concert hall—in a bid to improve sanitary and security conditions. Hundreds of numbers have to be called before it’s his turn to apply, Mr. Orellana said, adding he planned to wait because “it’s a legal route.” Mr. Campos said he and his family fled his hometown of El Papayo in Guerrero state, south of Mexico City, on Oct. 23 in the middle of the night. He showed a reporter some of the text messages threatening him and his family members. These text messages, he hopes, will serve as evidence for his asylum case. As he waited on Thursday, Mr. Campos voiced his frustration at the caravan migrants. “We’ve been here waiting for a long time,” he said, “and they don’t want to wait.” On Friday morning, Mr. Campos was the first to be called, and a grin broke out on his face as he and his large family, including his mother-in-law hobbling on a bad foot, lined up outside the U.S. port of entry on Friday. Mr. Campos hopes to make a fresh start in San Jose, Calif., where he says he once lived, undocumented, with many of his American-born children before agreeing to a voluntary deportation in 2008.",0
2105,"USA Today","Unlike some other large cities, Miami is following President Trump's executive order ending so-called ""sanctuary cities."" Video provided by Newsy Newslook
Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez (center) speaks during a hurricane preparedness press conference at the Miami-Dade County Emergency Operations Center on May 29, 2015 in Doral, Florida. MIAMI — President Trump is hailing the first victory in his fight against ""sanctuary cities"" after a South Florida mayor ordered his employees on Thursday to begin working more closely with federal immigration authorities.
For years, Miami-Dade County has refused to hold some undocumented immigrants in its jails for federal immigration agents. But after Trump signed an executive order threatening to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez changed his mind.
Gimenez signed an executive order Thursday ordering the director of his corrections department to begin honoring all requests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold immigration suspects in Miami-Dade County jails.
""Miami-Dade County complies with federal law and intends to fully cooperate with the federal government,"" the order read.
Gimenez said he made the decision to ensure that the county does not lose out on $355 million in federal funding it has coming in 2017.
Trump was quick to praise the decision, tweeting on Thursday: ""Right decision. Strong!""
The term ""sanctuary city"" is a broad term that describes up to 300 communities that have policies protecting the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants from deportation.
Some refuse to share any information with ICE agents. Some will share information, but refuse to hold undocumented immigrants for the sole purpose of giving ICE agents time to pick them up.
Trump vowed throughout the campaign to crack down on those cities. He often cited the example of Kate Steinle, a San Francisco woman who was shot and killed by an undocumented immigrant who had been released by the city's sheriff's department.
On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order that directed the Department of Homeland Security to identify and label ""sanctuary cities"" in the U.S. It ordered the department to publish a weekly roundup of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, including any local police departments that had custody of those immigrants but chose to release them.
The order also directed the departments of Justice and Homeland Security to identify federal grants that can be withheld from sanctuary cities that continue their practices. Those federal departments give out millions of dollars in grants each year to help local communities hire police officers, hold undocumented immigrants, improve community policing practices and crack down on violence against women.
""These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic,"" Trump's order read.
Big city mayors responded forcefully to Trump's order, with mayors from San Francisco to Chicago to New York vowing to fight back. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said he would even allow undocumented immigrants to seek refuge in city hall.
""They can use my office,"" Walsh said. ""They can use any office in this building.""A collection of police chiefs and sheriffs on Thursday also criticized Trump's attacks on sanctuary cities.
They say the practice of holding suspects in their jails solely for ICE has been ruled unconstitutional by federal courts. And they say the federal government should not try to force cities to carry out the federal responsibility of immigration enforcement.
""Law enforcement has a responsibility to work with federal immigration authorities. And the vast majority of police departments do,"" said Montgomery County (Md.) Police Chief Tom Manger. ""But this notion that the federal government would cut funding to coerce local policies to change is troubling.""",0
2332,"USA Today","After days of speculation, California decided Wednesday that it will comply with federal requests to deploy National Guard personnel to the border California shares with Mexico.
The California National Guard will accept federal money to beef up border security, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown said in a statement published Wednesday morning.
But he attached a disclaimer and made it clear that his acceptance of money didn't indicate he agreed with the federal government's agenda on immigration and borders.
""Let's be crystal clear on the scope of the mission,"" he wrote. ""This will not be a mission to build a new wall. It will not be a mission to round up women and children or detain people escaping violence and seeking a better life. And the California National Guard will not be enforcing federal immigration laws.""
The deployment's purpose is to supplement California's existing efforts to ""combat transnational crime,"" Brown said. Already at the state's 140.4-mile border with Mexico are 55 servicemembers on that mission.
► April 10: Along border, opinions divided over Trump's order to deploy Guard
► April 10: Thousands of Guard troops begin deploying on Mexican border
► April 10: Laredo braces for influx of National Guard troops in backyard
Brown's announcement follows similar statements from other border-state governors.
• Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey announced 225 guard members from his state deployed Monday with more than 100 additional troops sent Tuesday. It has 372.5 miles of border with Mexico.
• New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez said more than 80 state National Guard troops would be deployed this week. About 250 troops from her state will ultimately be patrolling the state's 179.5-mile border with Mexico.
• Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said about 250 Texas National Guards members have been deployed, a force that will be ramped up to about 1,000 from his state in coming weeks, he said. Texas shares 1,241 miles of border with Mexico.
But even though each state that borders Mexico has agreed to deploy its guardsmen, questions remain regarding their purpose and mission.
Border crossings for the past several years have been heading toward historic lows. The number of people caught trying to illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border last year was the lowest since 1971, according to the federal Department of Homeland Security.
Across California, 250 members of the state's National Guard are conducting what the governor called ""counterdrug missions,"" including the 55 at the border.
► April 6: Texas sending 250 Guard to border; Arizona to deploy 150 next week
► April 5: Mission needs will set border Guard size, Pentagon says
► April 5: Trump wants 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard troops on Mexican border
Those guardsmen perform a variety of tasks, including surveillance support at the San Diego Harbor; repairing roads, fences and culverts; and criminal analysis in cooperation with state and federal law enforcement, according to spokeswoman Lauren Hall of the California Military Department.
""The location of Guard personnel — and number specifically working in support of operations along the border, the coast and elsewhere in the state — will be dictated by the needs on the ground,"" said Brown's press secretary, Evan Westrup.",0
2152,"USA Today","Sen. Cory Booker D-N.J., questions Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2018, in Washington WASHINGTON, D.C. — Sen. Cory Booker invoked Martin Luther King and Gandhi Tuesday as he delivered an emotional 10-minute lecture to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nieslen over her 'amnesia' about whether President Donald Trump made vulgar references to immigrants.
""When ignorance and bigotry is alive with power, it is a dangerous force in our country,"" Booker said. ""Your silence and your amnesia is complicity.""
Nielsen repeatedly told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that Trump used ""tough language"" during an Oval Office meeting Thursday with senators about a bipartisan immigration deal the president did not support. But Nielsen said she did not hear him use the words ""shithole"" or ""shithouse"" in reference to Africa or Haiti.
After published reports said Trump complained about accepting immigrants from ""shithole"" countries, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., confirmed Trump had used the word. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who was also at the meeting, has corroborated Durbin's account.
Two Republicans who were also at the meeting, Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of South Carolina, have said they also did not hear Trump use the vulgar remark.
Booker, a new member of the committee, told Nielsen he was ""seething with anger"" over Trump's reported comments and the willingness of some in Washington to tolerate them.
He said racism grows when people do nothing to confront it, and quoted Trump's reaction to a neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Va. last summer in which the president blamed violence on ""both sides.""
""I sit here right now because when good white people in this country heard bigotry, or hatred, they stood up,"" Booker said. ""Moving into my home community, we were denied housing because of the color of my skin. And it was white Americans from Bergen County who banded together to fight against racism.""
Kirstjen Nielsen testifies Nov. 8, 2017, before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on her nomination to be secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Booker has repeatedly described how his parents, both executives with IBM, worked with housing activists when they tried to break the color barrier in Harrington Park. After Booker's parents tried to put a bid on a home and were turned down because they were black, a white couple made an offer that was accepted and then Booker's father showed up at the closing with a housing attorney.
Booker told Nielsen that when he heard about what happened from Durbin, he found it ""profoundly disturbing.""
""When Dick Durbin called me, I had tears of rage,"" Booker said.
He said violent incidents motivated by racism outnumber those carried out by radical Islamists, and described death threats received not only by himself and Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, who is also black, but also Sen. Mazie Hirhono, D-Hawaii, who was born in Japan.
""There are threats in this country. People plotting. I receive enough death threats to know the reality. Kamala receives enough death threats to know the reality. Mazie receives enough death threats to know the reality.
""And I've got a president of the United States whose office I respect who talks about the country origins and my fellow citizens in the most despicable manner. You don't remember, you can't remember the words of your commander in chief, I find that unacceptable.""
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. Booker used the full 10 minutes alloted for questions as the hearing, but Nieslen was given time after he finished to respond. She chose to focus on the threat posed by supremacist groups.
""I couldn't agree with you more,"" she told Booker. ""Our preventing terrorism programs have been reassessed and re-looked at just this year to ensure that we actually are going after the threats, to include white supremacy.""
Earlier in Tuesday's hearing, Durbin asked Nielsen what she recalls Trump saying.
""What I heard him saying was that he'd like to move away from a country-based quota system to a merit-based system so it shouldn't matter where you're from, it should matter what you can contribute to the United States,"" she replied.
When Durbin asked her about the specific language used, Nielsen said there were about a dozen people in the room, many talking over each other.
""There was a lot of rough talk by a lot of people in the room,"" Nielsen said, adding she could not recall specific words. ""What I was struck with frankly, as I'm sure you were as well, is just the general profanity that was used in the room by almost everyone.""
""You didn't hear me use profanity,"" Durbin shot back.
""No sir,"" Nielsen agreed. ""Neither did I.""",0
20,"FoxNews","More than 1,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents near the U.S.-Mexico border early Wednesday -- the largest ever group of migrants ever apprehended at a single time, sources told OutletName on Thursday. The group of 1,036 illegal immigrants found in the El Paso sector included migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, according to sources. The group was the largest group of migrants ever apprehended at a single time, sources told OutletName. The discovery was made in the El Paso section of the southern border – which provides support for the counties of El Paso and Hudspeth in the state of Texas and the entire state of New Mexico.  The record apprehension comes as the U.S. Border Patrol said Tuesday it's working to hire additional staff to manage the processing of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Right now, stations are overwhelmed with the influx of migrant families, as officials say are agents encountering more and larger groups of more than 100 people dropped in extremely remote locations along the Southwest border. Officials said the aim of beefing up staff is to take the burden off uniformed agents, who can then go back into the field. Agents said they are spending more than half their time feeding and caring for migrant families. Paperwork processing alone can take three hours per family. There were 58,474 families apprehended last month, according to CBP. In March, the agency said that there was an increase of nearly 106 percent over the same period last year. A top Border Patrol official told lawmakers in April that authorities have apprehended more families illegally crossing the border between October 2018 and February of this year than during all of the 2018 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 2017-Sept. 30, 2018). ""Much media attention has focused on caravans coming across from Central America,"" Rio Grande Valley Sector Chief Patrol Agent Rodolfo Karisch told the Senate Homeland Security Committee. ""But the fact is that RGV is receiving caravan-equivalent numbers every seven days."" Border Patrol has about 19,500 agents assigned nationwide and has struggled with hiring for many years — the number of agents peaked at 21,444 in fiscal year 2011. Many positions require living in remote desert towns across the U.S.-Mexico border. Agents must pass a detailed background check and a lie detector test that has been required since 2012 is a major hurdle, with just a 28% pass rate between 2013 and 2016. On Thursday, President Trump teased he is going to ""have a big statement"" on border security ""soon"" after Politico reported he is considering prohibiting people if they have traveled through a country other than their own before coming to the U.S. ""No, I'm not closing the border,"" he told reporters. ""It has to do with the border, it will be my biggest statement so far.""",1
2551,"Reuters","A federal judge on Wednesday signaled she may extend an order preventing the deportation of roughly 50 Indonesian Christians living illegally in New Hampshire, a process that immigration officials began after U.S. President Donald Trump took office.
U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston expressed concern the Indonesians could be deported before their administrative appeals were finished, given their claims they could face religious persecution in the world’s largest majority-Muslim nation.
The Indonesians’ lawyers argued for an injunction that would give them time to file motions to reopen their immigration cases based on changed conditions in Indonesia.
“We don’t want to put them on a ship back unless someone has had chance to look at if there’s a really bad situation for them,” Saris said. “That’s my concern.”
The case centers on a group of Indonesians who fled that country during violence two decades ago and had been allowed to live openly in New Hampshire under an informal deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.
That changed after Trump ordered an end to that kind of program in his push to tighten immigration enforcement.The Indonesians are part of an ethnic community of about 2,000 people clustered around Dover, New Hampshire. Most members of the group covered by the 2010 deal with ICE entered the county legally but overstayed their visas and failed to seek asylum on time.
Federal officials contend they have always had the authority to deport them at any time.
“There’s no legal basis for them to ask for more time,” Vinita Andrapalliyal, a U.S. Justice Department lawyer, argued in court on Wednesday.
Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts.
Over the Justice Department’s objections, Saris last year ruled she had jurisdiction over the case. She entered a temporary order blocking the Indonesians’ deportation until she could decide whether to impose a preliminary injunction.
Ronaldo Rauseo-Ricupero, a lawyer for the Indonesians, argued they should have 90 days to move to reopen their cases after receiving copies of their administrative case files and time to appeal any decision rejecting those motions.
Saris in October ordered immigration officials to provide the immigrants’ lawyers with the files so they could start their administrative appeals. The files are expected to be finished being turned over by next month, Saris said.",0

84,"FoxNews","President Trump turned to an unlikely source Tuesday evening to find support for his hard-line immigration policies: his predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump tweeted a 2005 video in which Obama, then a senator, made a statement against illegal immigration, accompanied by the comment ""I agree with President Obama 100%"". ""We are a generous and welcoming people here in the United States,"" Obama says in the 31-second clip. ""But those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law. We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants into this country."" Obama is not the only Democrat cited by Trump and his supporters to justify crackdowns on illegal immigration. Another is former President Bill Clinton, whose State of the Union address in 1995 featured the following: ""All Americans ... are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country,"" Clinton said that night. ""The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens."" ""We are a nation of immigrants,"" Clinton added. ""But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it."" Tuesday's tweet came as the Trump administration wrestles with what to do if a caravan of some 7,000 people that originated in Central America arrives at the U.S.-Mexico border. The march appeared to begin as a group of about 160 who decided to band together in Honduras for protection against the gangs who prey on migrants traveling alone; it snowballed as the group moved north. It now has thousands of people and is facing more than 1,000 miles, likely farther, to the end of the journey. The caravan comes on the heels of a surge in apprehensions of families at the southern border, which has given Trump a fresh talking point to rally his base ahead of next month's midterm elections. Nearly a third of all people apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border during the budget year 2018 were families and children — about 157,248 out of 395,579 total apprehensions. In a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department on Tuesday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, suggested that the administration make a ""third party"" agreement with Mexico that would force any caravan members seeking asylum to do so in their country of arrival — Mexico. The lawmakers said the process already works that way in Europe.",1
287,"FoxNews","The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it will directly ask the Supreme Court to overrule a federal court judge who last week barred officials from asking about citizenship on the 2020 census, saying in a court opinion that such a question would dramatically reduce the response rate -- and congressional representation -- of noncitizens.
The White House's highly unusual move, if approved by the Supreme Court, would allow the administration's lawyers to bypass intermediate appellate courts. Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in court papers filed Tuesday that the rare and fast turnaround is necessary if census questionnaires are to be printed in time.
The once-a-decade census determines not only how many seats are apportioned per district in the House of Representatives, but also how hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenue are distributed.
It's been 30 years since the court took on an issue without waiting for a federal appeals court to weigh in. Francisco says the justices should hear arguments in April or a special session in May.
The many court challenges against the Trump administration's bid to add a citizenship question, legal experts tell OutletName, face an uphill battle not only because conservatives now command a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court, but also because traditionally it's been the White House's prerogative to decide whether to inquire about citizenship on the census.
WATCH: ILLEGAL IMMIGRATIONS FEARFUL OF NEW CITIZENSHIP QUESTION
Former President Barack Obama's administration didn't ask the question in the 2010 census amid fears it would unconstitutionally intimidate illegal immigrants into avoiding answering their census questions -- and thus not count toward population totals used to determine the number of seats each state receives in the House of Representatives.
The citizenship question was last asked on the census in 1950, but beginning in 1970, a citizenship question was asked in a long-form questionnaire sent to a relatively small number of households, alongside the main census. In 2010, there was no long-form questionnaire.
""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law,"" Chapman University law professor and constitutional law expert John Eastman told OutletName. ""The recent move is simply to restore what had long been the case.""
Eastman also told OutletName it would be legally permissible for the government to only count citizens for purposes of determining representation in the House of Representatives. However, other legal experts have contested that view, saying the Constitution demands that all ""persons"" be tallied -- not simply all citizens.
ANALYSIS: TRUMP IS RIGHT, ENDING BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS CONSTITUTIONAL
Democrats would lose out because the citizenship question would affect predominantly liberal districts, but that's not a legally sufficient objection, legal analysts say.
The citizenship question represents the third time since October that Francisco is seeking the court's intervention without an appellate ruling. The other two involved Obama-era programs to shield young immigrants from deportation and allow transgender people to serve in the military.
""There is no credible argument to be made that asking about citizenship subverts the Constitution and federal law."" — Chapman University law professor John Eastman
The Supreme Court hasn't acted on the immigration case, and an appellate court has since ruled on the issue. The justices on Tuesday denied early review of the transgender service policy, but allowed Pentagon restrictions that had been blocked by lower courts to take effect while the appeals process unfolds.
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced in March 2018 that the 2020 census would be the first since 1950 to include a citizenship question. He contended that the question would help the government enforce the 1965 Voting Rights Act and ensure access to the ballot.
But 18 states, the District of Columbia, 15 big cities or counties, and immigrants' rights groups sued the Commerce Department, which designs the census, and claimed it failed to properly analyze the effect that the question would have on households with immigrants. The challengers said the Trump administration added the question to discourage immigrants from participating, potentially leading to a population undercount — and possibly fewer seats in Congress — in places that tend to vote Democratic.
U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman used Census Bureau estimates to conclude the citizenship question would depress responses in households with noncitizens by at least 5.8 percent.
TUCKER: BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP IS A TOTAL SCAM
Furman ruled that Ross acted in an ""arbitrary and capricious"" manner and violated the law.
The justices already had agreed to an administration request to hear arguments over whether Furman could base his decision on depositions of high-ranking officials and other material that was not part of the administrative record the Commerce Department compiled in deciding to ask about citizenship. In the end, Furman largely stuck to that record and the court has now called off arguments that were scheduled for Feb. 19.
The court could decide in the  few weeks whether to set new arguments on the timetable the Justice Department wants.
During his confirmation hearings in October, Trump's pick to lead the Census Bureau, Steven Dillingham, largely avoided questions on the matter. He later won Senate confirmation.

Steve Daines, R-Mont., tried to get Dillingham to weigh in, saying that citizens in “Montana should have more of a say in Washington, D.C., than illegal immigrants harboring in sanctuary cities across the country."" But the nominee responded: “I have no plans to voice an opinion on that question.”
""It makes no sense why a state like California that harbors millions of illegal immigrants is rewarded with additional representation in Congress and taxpayer resources at the expense of more rural states like Montana,"" Daines told OutletName in October. ""That is rewarding illegal behavior.""

535,"Breitbart","Americans who lost loved ones to illegal alien crime cheered President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, telling OutletName News they hope he begins construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall quickly.
“It’s incredible,” said one woman whose brother was killed by an illegal alien. “It’s unreal. I’m so happy, so happy, and excited and can’t wait for him to become our president tomorrow.”
Asked by OutletName News’ Washington political editor Matt Boyle what she wants to see done on Day One of Trump’s presidency, she said: “Build that wall! Build that wall, stop illegal immigration. Keep American families from being killed by illegal immigrants.”
Dan Golvach, whose son, Spencer, was killed by a previously-deported illegal alien, told Trump to stick to his guns.
“Keep being yourself,” Golvach said. “No other candidates that were in this race reached out to us. He did. He treated us like family. He knows us by name.”
“We’ve all seen him when the cameras aren’t on,” he continued. “And he’s sincere. He’s a great man. Full of energy. And I think that if anybody can turn this country around, the way it needs to be, it’s Donald Trump.”

Agnes Gibboney, a legal immigrant whose son Ronald da Silva was murdered in 2002 by an illegal alien, said Trump’s promises to enforce immigration meant a great deal.
“It means a lot. Not only to me, so I wouldn’t lose another loved one, but to everybody in this country,” she said. “We need to secure our borders, enforce our laws. We need to do what’s right.”",1
53,"FoxNews","Every new illegal immigrant that enters the United States will cost more than $82,000 each over their lifetime, a conservative think tank that advocates for lower immigration levels has claimed. The Center for Immigration Studies updated their 2012 analysis which put the average lifetime net fiscal cost of a border crosser at $74,722. In the six years since, the price has jumped to $82,191. The think tank’s analysis has come into question however, with multiple outlets pushing back on its numbers and methodology. The new figure by the CIS estimates what it takes to protect the border, educate, house and feed illegal immigrants and makes the assumption they will spend a lifetime on various welfare programs. This estimate means that for every 100,000 illegal immigrants that are stopped from crossing the border, it would save taxpayers $8.2 billion over the illegal immigrants’ lifetimes, the report states. The report also concludes that a southern border wall between the U.S. and Mexico would only have to stop four percent of undocumented migrants, or about 60,000 over the next 10 years, to recoup the cost of President Trump’s $5 billion funding ask. Almost everyone has come up with a different price tag on the cost of illegal immigration. President Trump, for example, has touted several different estimates. During a Cabinet meeting in late December, Trump put the price of illegal immigration as high as $275 billion. “I’ve heard numbers as high as $275 billion we lose on illegal immigrants,” he said. “The $5, $5.6 billion approve by the House is such a small amount compared to the level of the problem.” In early December, Trump said illegal immigration cost $250 billion per year. On Dec. 18, he said it was “more than $250 billion” per year. That number jumped dramatically two days later when he claimed, “illegal immigration cost our nation $275 billion a year.” Meg Wiehe, deputy director at the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told OutletName that Trump’s figure “sounds extraordinarily high to me.” David Dyssegaard Kallick, deputy director of the nonpartisan Fiscal Policy Institute, was more blunt, calling the numbers “frankly absurd.” CIS research director Steven Camarota says even though experts may disagree over his numbers, one thing is clear - a border wall with Mexico will eventually pay for itself by reducing taxpayer burdens. “The range of reasonable assumption indicated that a wall would not have to come close to being anywhere near 100 percent effective to pay for itself,” he wrote. “This would be true even if a wall cost twice as much. A wall that is only partially effective could pay for itself by offsetting the cost that otherwise successful illegal crossers would create. “",1
2194,"USA Today","President Donald Trump has painted a bleak picture of life on the U.S.-Mexico border as a land overrun with human traffickers, drug smugglers, rapists and blood-thirsty gang members. 
But a Republican congressman from Texas says Trump's characterization of a border crisis is a ""myth"" and the idea of a wall is a ""third-century solution to a 21st-century problem."" 
Rep. Will Hurd, 41, told Rolling Stone that ""when you think of a crisis, that means people are afraid to leave their homes, right?"" 
But ""El Paso is one of the safest cities in the United States of America. The same can be said about Del Rio, Presidio and Eagle Pass, places I represent,"" the former CIA officer said. 
Hurd, who narrowly won re-election in the recent midterms, also criticized Trump for using a partial government shutdown that affects the Department of Homeland Security as leverage to secure funding for a barrier on the southern border.
""If there is a crisis, why are the people that are dealing with it not being paid?"" he asked Rolling Stone. 
Hurd, who represents a district he says includes 820 miles of the roughly 1,900-mile border with Mexico, has voted with House Democrats on legislation to reopen the government that does not include wall funding. He said a barrier only makes sense in places where there is ""urban-to-urban contact"" like there is between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. 
Instead, he proposes increasing security at points of entry, where the bulk of illegal drugs come into the U.S., improved technology along the border to create a ""smart fence"" and a ""Marshall Plan for Central America"" to address the root problems that are leading so many migrants to make the dangerous journey north. 
""It’s a big package, but it’s also what is needed in order to make sure our country is safe,"" he said. ",0
2281,"USA Today","The Department of Homeland Security said it set up a fake university in Michigan to target immigrant students who were staying in the U.S. without proper authorization, according to federal indictments unsealed Wednesday.
Eight people were arrested and indicted for conspiracy to commit visa fraud and harboring aliens for profit, said US. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Matthew Schneider. Six of them were arrested in metro Detroit, one in Florida, and another in Virginia.
An indictment says the defendants helped at least 600 ""foreign citizens to illegally remain, re-enter and work in the United States and actively recruited them to enroll in a fraudulent school as part of a 'pay to stay' scheme.""
The indictments were filed Jan. 15 and unsealed Wednesday. They allege that from February 2017 through January 2019, the defendants ""conspired with each other and others to fraudulently facilitate hundreds of foreign nationals in illegally remaining and working in the United States by actively recruiting them to enroll into a metro Detroit private university that, unbeknownst to the conspirators, was operated by HSI (Homeland Security Investigation) special agents as part of an undercover operation.""
HSI is an investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security.
“We are all aware that international students can be a valuable asset to our country, but as this case shows, the well-intended international student visa program can also be exploited and abused,” said U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider in a statement.
The fake university is located in Farmington Hills, a Detroit suburb.
Its website touts it as a credible university, saying: ""Located in the heart of the automotive and advanced manufacturing center of Southeast Michigan, the University of Farmington provides students from throughout the world a unique educational experience. Our dynamic business administration and STEM curriculum allows students to rapidly apply their knowledge; preparing them to succeed in an ever-globalizing economy.""
But the university was staffed with undercover agents working with Homeland Security.
In order to study in the U.S., immigrants must get certain types of visas and approval from universities authorized by the Department of Homeland Security. After obtaining a F-1 visa, the student has to stay enrolled and maintain progress toward a degree; if not, they have to leave the U.S. within 60 days.
The indictments say the operation allowed students to stay in the U.S. without proper visas. The U.S. alleges the students who enrolled ""knew that they would not attend any actual classes, earn credits or make academic progress towards an actual degree,"" read an indictment.
The eight defendants charged are accused of helping enroll the students in exchange for cash, kickbacks and tuition credits as part of the ""pay to stay"" scheme.
Rahul Reddy, an immigration attorney in Houston, said in a live stream that immigrant students who may have been enrolled at the university were detained in Houston, Atlanta, Charlotte, and St. Louis. Reddy said that concerned students have contacted him today.
“Homeland Security Investigations special agents uncovered a nationwide network that grossly exploited U.S. immigration laws,"" said Special Agent in Charge Steve Francis, who heads HSI's Detroit office. ""These suspects aided hundreds of foreign nationals to remain in the United States illegally by helping to portray them as students, which they most certainly were not.""
HSI agents have been conducting this investigation since 2015, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
Charged in the indictments were:
Barath Kakireddy, 29, of Lake Mary, Florida.
Suresh Kandala, 31, of Culpeper, Virginia.
Phanideep Karnati, 35, of Louisville, Kentucky.
Prem Rampeesa, 26, of Charlotte, North Carolina.

Raphael A. Sanchez is accused of devising a scheme to obtain money and property by using the identities of “seven aliens in various stages of immigration proceedings” with ICE over a period of four years to defraud American Express Corp, Bank of America Corp and others, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle. Sanchez, who is due to make an initial court appearance Thursday morning, is charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft, court documents show. He has resigned from the agency, his lawyer, Cassandra Stamm, said on Wednesday. The offenses allegedly took place between October 2013 and October 2017, and included an instance of forwarding a copy of part of a Chinese passport and other information from his government email address, according to court documents. The investigation involved ICE’s internal affairs division, according to an ICE official, who referred questions to the U.S. Department of Justice. The Justice Department, whose Public Integrity Section brought the charges, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. As chief counsel, Sanchez was involved in a $2.25 million government settlement in 2015 with Broetje Orchards, a Washington state company that admitted to employing unauthorized workers after being told by ICE they did not have permission to work in the United States.",0
41,"FoxNews","You’ve heard it a thousand times, so many times it’s like background noise: Walls are racist. We could give you a thousand examples, but here’s a just one, from MSOutletName over this past weekend:
 
""This wall that the president wants is a monument to white nationalism,"" said Jason Johnson, political editor for TheRoot.com. ""Anybody who agrees to give any money to this wall is foolish."" Hundreds of different people could have said exactly the same thing, and have, almost word-for word. For the media, questioning the racism of President Trump’s border wall is like questioning gravity. If you want a wall, or any kind of secure border, you must be some kind of white supremacist.
 
What’s interesting about this argument – and again, you hear it everywhere - is how Orwellian this argument it is. Ask yourself: Who, exactly, supports unrestricted low-wage immigration? Who benefits most from it? If there’s any group in America that supports having more than 20 million people here illegally, it’s not our poor. It’s the people in our richest neighborhoods. Nobody else even comes close. If you made a chart, and let’s be honest here, you’d have to put rich, white people are the very top. Our endless supply of new immigrants gives them access to much cheaper household help -- nannies, housekeepers, gardeners, whatever. It makes the products they buy cheaper. Most of all, it makes them virtuous, like they’re helping the employees they exploit achieve the American dream. If there’s any group in America that supports having more than 20 million people here illegally, it’s not our poor. It’s the people in our richest neighborhoods. Nobody else even comes close. So what’s the flip side? Who gets hurt most by our new borderless country? Again, it’s not even close: African-Americans. Here’s Cornell economics professor Vernon Briggs, who said the following:
 
“Because most illegal immigrants overwhelmingly seek work in the low skilled labor market and because the black American labor force is so disproportionately concentrated in this same low wage sector, there is little doubt that there is significant overlap in competition for jobs in this sector of the labor market,"" said Cornell economics professor Vernon Briggs. ""Given the inordinately high unemployment rates for low skilled black workers … it is obvious that the major loser in this competition are low skilled black workers.” Tucker Carlson Tonight – Monday, January 7Video
In other words -- and you already knew this and anybody who has thought about this for a second does --  low wage immigration is costing African-Americans jobs and money. Other studies have reached the same conclusion. It’s obviously true. And because it’s obviously true, that’s exactly why the people benefitting from it don’t want to have the conversation. It’s why they scream bigotry until you shut up. But we won’t shut up.",1
5,"FoxNews","President Trump has announced a set of immigration reforms, many of which have merit. Even he acknowledges there’s little chance that Congress will act on them at least until after the 2020 elections. Yet the crisis at our border continues, as even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi now acknowledges. But there’s also a crisis of trust – trust in our government’s ability to solve big challenges. We feel this deeply: America is a nation of laws. It must have borders and it must enforce its laws impartially and consistently. We’re doing neither. And with every day the trust gap widens. Do we trust that anyone in the federal government will really do something to address what is beyond question a broken immigration system? Finally, we don’t have to trust – we can see that President Trump has taken action. We have a broken immigration system. Our borders are so porous that they encourage the greedy and cruel to take advantage of those seeking a better life. Human trafficking continues unabated and unchallenged. “Sanctuary cities” make a mockery of the rule of law. We have a broken asylum system that can’t effectively distinguish between those fleeing real threats from those simply looking for better economic opportunities. And we have a broken guest worker program that leaves people frustrated at the border and in boardrooms. These problems have been ongoing and festering for the better part of five decades. Thankfully, the administration has now courageously stepped into the morass and offered at least a partial guidepost for making real and lasting progress on the current crisis, as well as longstanding problems with our system. We must start with the border. This is not simply a talking point. Securing the border, adequately policing our points of entry, erecting physical and virtual barriers, and obtaining operational control of who comes in and out of this country are prerequisites for any lasting future legal immigration reform. The United States ought to know who is entering its borders, and for what purposes. A laughably insecure border only encourages the lawless drug cartels who are reaping billions of dollars from the new revenue stream of immigrants who wish to enter our country. The president’s proposal takes a strong step in the right direction by strengthening immigration and enforcement agencies, making the necessary investments along the southern border, and closing the loopholes that are exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. It is encouraging to see the administration prioritize a workable system for asylum-seekers. We should offer America’s protection to those who are truly persecuted in their own homelands, but we must be able to determine that those threats are real – that the migrant isn’t simply reading from a script provided by traffickers or other bad-faith actors. Poverty is not a credible basis for asylum because America cannot house the world’s impoverished. We must also recognize the important role immigration plays in our economy. American prosperity requires the industry and insight immigrants have always brought to America. President Trump’s proposal to grant more green cards based on merit, rather than family relationships, is a good idea. Nations like Australia and Canada have proven this works. As our economy becomes increasingly high-tech, we will need the highly skilled workers that a merit-based approach would provide. And finally, we need a guest-worker program that ends the black market for labor. We can have an efficient system that helps industries – such as farming, service, and hospitality – find the workers they need while also broadly protecting American wages. The government’s historical approach, de facto non-enforcement, is lawlessness – and lawlessness is, in fact, what millions are fleeing. It’s why they want to come to America. Why would we want to imitate that lawlessness here? President Trump says his plan is “pro-American, pro-immigrant and pro-worker.” We should all be able to agree that those are worthy goals. The crisis at the border is real, and so is the crisis of faith in our government. Our elected officials can address both, by keeping their promises, enforcing our laws and ultimately, securing the border, and reforming our immigration system. President Trump has taken the first step. That’s how you rebuild trust – by action. Let’s see if Congress follows, or gets left behind by the American people.",1
2411,"Reuters","The number of illegal immigrants crossing into the United States from Mexico declined by 40 percent from January to February, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on Wednesday. The downturn came after President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20 vowing to deport many of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. The flow of illegal border crossings as measured by apprehensions and the prevention of inadmissible persons at the southern border dropped to 18,762 persons in February from 31,578 in January, Kelly said in a statement. He said the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, which compiled the data, historically sees a 10 percent to 20 percent increase in apprehensions of illegal immigrants from January to February. On Jan. 25, Trump ordered the construction of a wall along the roughly 2,000-mile (3,200-km) U.S.-Mexico border, moved to strip federal funding from “sanctuary” states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants, and expanded the force of U.S. immigration agents. “Since the administration’s implementation of Executive Orders to enforce immigration laws, apprehensions and inadmissible activity is trending toward the lowest monthly total in at least the last five years,” Kelly said.",0
238,"FoxNews","Making good on a promise to overturn Obama-era immigration policies, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests increased 38 percent during the first three months of the Trump administration.
''These statistics reflect President Trump's commitment to enforce our immigration laws fairly and across the board,'' said ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan.
The increase reflects arrests made not at the border, but in U.S. cities, so called 'interior enforcement,” something critics say almost disappeared in the last year of the Obama Administration.
TRUMP'S TOUGH IMMIGRATION RHETORIC SLOWS ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS: 'WE'RE AT A TRICKLE'
According to the Department of Homeland Security:
* ICE has arrested more than 41,000 individuals who are either known or suspected of being in the country illegally. This reflects an increase of 37.6 percent over the same period in 2016.
* Nearly 75 percent of those arrested during this period in 2017 are convicted criminals, with offenses ranging from homicide and assault to sexual abuse and drug-related charges.
* The arrest of aliens at-large in the community increased by more than 50 percent.
* The arrest of convicted illegal immigrants climbed nearly 20 percent
* The arrest of non-criminal illegal immigrants rose 150 percent, to 10,800 since the beginning of the year compared to 4,200 in the same period in 2016.
The arrest of non-criminal illegal immigrants is controversial. To advocates, entering the U.S. illegally is a civil crime not worth punishing.
Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck believes shielding illegal immigrants from deportation increases the likelihood they'll cooperate with police in catching criminal aliens. He raised the point during a news conference following the arrest of 44 members of the brutal gang MS-13, half of whom are in the U.S. illegally.
""Many of witnesses that allowed us to do this by their statements – also have immigration issues,"" said Beck. ""You could say sanctuary policies make us successful (because) we get people to talk.""
CALIFORNIA REPUBLICANS PUSH PLANS TO PUNISH SANCTUARY CITIES
The Los Angeles Police Commission is considering a proposal to ignore crimes like loitering, graffiti, and sleeping in cars to counter immigrant fears that ICE will track police arrests, leading to their deportation for minor crimes. But opponents blame such policies for the rise in non-criminal immigrant arrests.
""Numerous law enforcement agencies have taken the step to not even honor detainers and that makes it extremely difficult for us,"" says Los Angeles ICE Director Dave Marin. ""They're just letting these individuals, convicted criminal aliens, and they're letting them out the door.""
That forces agents to conduct fugitive operations on the streets and in the workplace, whereas in the past ICE could pick criminal aliens up directly from jail.
Now, Marin says, agents encounter more spouses, relatives and co-workers who did not commit crime but were here illegally. Unlike the Obama administration, which used “prosecutorial discretion” to release non-criminals illegal immigrants, ICE under Trump does not, which explains the 150 percent increase.
In January, at his inauguration, President Trump said: ""A nation without borders is not a nation. Beginning today, the United States of America gets back control of its borders.""
The new arrest numbers support that claim, as many at the Department of Homeland Security say border security doesn't start at the border, but in cities, where actual enforcement leads to deterrence.",1
476,"Breitbart","Politico’s White House reporter, Nancy Cook, came out with a curious article on Thursday, laying out how, with Congress unlikely to approve any funding for President Donald Trump’s planned border wall, he should instead go the route of a national emergency declaration, and that it is OutletName News that has been leading the way in framing the argument for such a declaration.
Cook wrote:
The White House is finalizing details of a potential national emergency declaration to secure President Donald Trump’s border wall, even as lawmakers are trying to broker an immigration deal that could avert another shutdown in just over two weeks. Trump met with his budget chief, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Jared Kushner and other top officials, including White House lawyers, on Tuesday to walk through the logistics of such a move. And White House aides have been quietly meeting with outside conservative political groups to build support for the president to take such an action. Those talking points, which emphasize Trump’s legal authority, have begun to show up in such conservative media outlets as OutletName News.
OutletName News has certainly been ahead of the curve with the rest of the media on this particular matter. A week ago, on Jan. 24, OutletName News legal editor Ken Klukowski explained how President Trump has the legal authority–already delegated to him from Congress–to build the wall on the border.
Klukowski explains:
Congress has passed 136 statutory provisions pertaining to presidential emergency powers over the years, delegating significant authority to the president when he declares an emergency. Congress’s research arm notes that in certain types of emergencies, these powers include restricting travel, seizing commodities or property, and regulating businesses.
Not only that, but Congress specifically amended the Posse Comitatus Act – the law that prevents U.S. military troops from operating on U.S. soil, found at 18 U.S.C. § 1385 – in the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act to allow U.S. troops to function domestically under certain circumstances. One of those circumstances is to enforce federal law. Another is that the defense secretary can deploy troops to stop illegal aliens from crossing the U.S. border if the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requests military assistance.
Klukowski cites federal law, specifically 33 U.S.C. § 2293(a), in which, once the president declares an emergency, the Secretary of Defense:
…without regard to any other provision of law, may … apply the resources of the Department of the Army’s civil works program, including funds, personnel, and equipment, to construct or assist in the construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of authorized civil works, military construction, and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense.
Klukowski adds in the next paragraphs:
The next subsection of that law adds that this authority continues until the president declares the emergency has ended, plus an additional 180 days. Congress passed the Secure Fence Act in 2006, which explicitly authorizes building physical barriers on the U.S.-Mexican border. But even if Congress had not passed that law, the separate law quoted above gives President Trump all the authority he needs to act without further approval from Capitol Hill. Once President Trump declares an emergency on the border, he can direct Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan to order the Army Corps of Engineers to begin constructing the wall. Congress has already appropriated $13.9 billion in emergency funds that the Corps can use, much more funding than the president’s $5.7 billion plan calls for. Additionally, if DHS requests military support, the Pentagon can then also send however many additional troops the president needs to protect the workers and secure the border during construction. Lawsuits are likely, but it is possible that only Congress itself has standing to sue. The only other injury that any other plaintiff could claim is that they have a legal right to illegally enter the United States. Even the most liberal judicial activist might look askance at such a lawsuit.
It’s hardly just that Klukowski piece that Cook is talking about. On Thursday, OutletName News’s Michael Patrick Leahy reported on how the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) has determined that President Trump can build the wall legally without further congressional authorization. From Leahy’s report on the CRS report:
“The circumstances in which the Section 2808 authority [of Title 10 of the U.S. Code that codifies the National Emergencies Act] could be used to deploy fencing along the border appears to be a question of first impression, and one that is likely to be vigorously litigated,” the CRS report noted. The report cited two sections of Title 10 of the U.S. Code: Section 2803 and Section 284, which are are separate and distinct from Section 2808, the section of Title 10 that grants presidential authority under the National Emergencies Act. Section 2803, “provides that the Secretary of Defense ‘may carry out a military construction project not otherwise authorized by law’ upon determining that (1) ‘the project is vital to the national security or to the protection of health, safety, or the quality of the environment,’ and (2) ‘the requirement for the project is so urgent that’ deferring the project ‘would be inconsistent with national security or the protection of health, safety, or environmental quality.’ ” Section 284, “provides that the Secretary of Defense ‘may provide support for the counterdrug activities or activities to counter transnational organized crime’ of any law enforcement agency, including through the ‘[c]onstruction of roads and fences and installation of lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States.’ The caveat related to Section 284 is that the Department of Defense’s “authority to construct fences appears to extend only to ‘drug smuggling corridors,’ a condition that may limit where DOD could deploy fencing.”
Also this week, OutletName News’s Sean Moran interviewed Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL)–a leading authority on immigration policy on Capitol Hill–about a national emergency declaration.
Brooks told OutletName News:
We have a national emergency at the border, the President of the United States ought to declare a national emergency to save roughly 50 American lives per day, or, over 15,000 American lives per year. I encourage the President to use the United States Code 10 Section 284, which empowers the President of the United States to order America’s military to the border, to assist law enforcement agents in the fight against drugs and transnational crime. Interestingly, 10 U.S.C. 284 which has already been approved by Congress, which has already been signed by a president, empowers the Pentagon to deploy both active military and national guard troops to transport personnel, supplies and equipment, establish and operate bases of operation, detect and monitor surface traffic in Mexico. And, within 25 miles of the border in the United States, to construct roads, fences, lighting, to block drugs and smuggling corridors in the aerial and ground reconnaissance.
OutletName News has published a number of other pieces about this in recent weeks, including video of a Department of Defense official explaining the rationale for such a declaration, polling data showing Trump’s base would gladly support him on such a decision, news on Trump’s comments about his authority to make such a declaration, and congressional leaders discussing the possibility.
As the negotiations have continued between the White House and congressional leaders on this issue–in the leadup, during, and after the longest government shutdown in U.S. history which ended last week–OutletName News’s Neil Munro and John Binder have also had cutting edge news reporting from inside the negotiating room about the thus-far-failed talks.
That’s not all. The Cartel Chronicles team for OutletName News on the U.S. border with Mexico, led by editor Brandon Darby, also broke a big story that provides justification for the idea that there is a national emergency on the border: A cartel operating along the Laredo Sector of Texas’s border with Mexico has now been taken over by an actual terrorist, someone convicted of bombing a U.S. consulate.
Darby and Idelfonso Ortiz reported exclusively for OutletName News:
A verified and convicted terrorist who attacked a U.S. Consulate with a grenade and automatic rifle fire has taken over the ruthless Los Zetas cartel, a group headquartered at the Texas border in the Nuevo Laredo-Laredo metropolitan border area. Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, sits immediately across the border from Laredo, Texas, and is the only urban location along the entire U.S.-Mexico Border that does not have any fencing or constructed security barrier of any kind. The convicted terrorist, Hector Raul Luna Luna, is known as “El Tory” and was convicted in the 2008 terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey, Mexico. He was released from prison due to bribes paid by Cartel Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and has now taken over the dominant faction of Los Zetas, Cartel Del Noreste (CDN), to open up the lucrative and unsecured border corridor into Texas.
It remains to be seen what will happen next. The federal government is only open until Feb. 15 and Democrats on Capitol Hill have flatly refused to negotiate with Trump for the wall, despite some indicating openness to building a wall. Trump will give his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening in the House, with exactly ten days to go before government funding lapses again. If Congress fails yet again to get a deal, though, as OutletName News has repeatedly shown, Trump still has a path to build the wall. The only looming question then is whether he will do it.",1
1483,"WSJ","Trustees for the combined Social Security trust funds have just warned Congress that the funds are running out of money faster than expected. Revenues from payroll taxes in 2017 were lower than predicted, and spending on old-age and survivor benefits and Medicare higher. As former trustee Charles Blahous reported recently in these pages, spending now exceeds revenues and has begun eating into principal, a turning point that as recently as last year wasn’t expected until 2022. The Medicare fund is now due to run dry in 2026. The depletion is exacerbated by the lack of actual money in the funds; real money has been exchanged for Treasury IOUs. These dire predictions bear heavily on another issue bedeviling Congress at the moment: immigration reform. Without working-age immigrants steadily expanding the American labor force, the trust funds would be going broke even faster than they are now. Yet Congress, under pressure from President Trump and other nativists in the Republican Party, is focused on curtailing rather than expanding the supply of immigrant labor. This is totally irrational, and not only because it will hasten the day when Congress will have to take painful measures to keep entitlements flowing. The U.S. has a labor shortage already. The Labor Department reported last week that job openings now exceed the number of people listed as unemployed. Only 3.8% of the workforce is unemployed, just under the 4% that is usually regarded—because of temporary joblessness, or “float”—as full employment. Immigration accounts for more than half of U.S. population growth, and a Pew Research report last year showed that working-age immigrants will be vital to the future expansion of the labor force. Labor is a factor of production even in an advanced economy that invests heavily in plant and equipment. Without an expanding labor supply, it is hard to achieve economic growth, which is essential to finance a welfare state like ours. Manufacturers can invest in robots to substitute for some human workers, but the service sector employs far more workers in the U.S., and it isn’t easy to invent a robot that can do the job of a doctor or teacher. The American Medical Association has estimated that 27% of doctors practicing in the U.S. are foreign born. More to the point, robots don’t pay the payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare. Despite the major economic stimulus provided by last year’s tax reform, the American labor force hasn’t expanded. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 62.7% of working-age Americans had jobs in May, unchanged from the previous year. That’s almost 5 percentage points below the most recent peak level of participation, 67.3% in 2000. To be sure, the Trump administration’s tax and regulatory reforms have led to an expansion of employment, but not by much. Roughly 155,474,000 Americans had jobs in May—an increase of only 1.7% from a year earlier, less than the rate of economic growth. The rise in employment wasn’t enough to satisfy increased demand for labor. Numerous theories have been suggested to explain the low workforce-participation rate. One factor may be the retirement of the large baby boom generation—which, not incidentally, also adds to entitlement costs. Government statisticians often blame that hard-to-control trend for the labor-participation dip, but less apologetic researchers also note the government’s overgenerosity in granting disability insurance. The number of workers receiving federal disability benefits has soared to about 10 million in 2010 from about four million in 1990, though standards have since been tightened and the increase in awards has leveled off. At any rate, the trust funds are now bearing a heavier disability burden. And certainly an elaborate safety net for the unemployed reduces the incentive for work. Faced with these disturbing trends, President Trump nonetheless announced last August his support for legislation that would cut legal immigration in half within a decade. This would be done mainly by curtailing the ability of American citizens and legal residents to bring family members into the country. In short, the goal was to reduce the workforce even more than was happening already, for the professed purpose of protecting American jobs. To the credit of congressional Republicans, this draconian policy remains in limbo. The more active debate in Congress is how to legalize the status of the million or so “Dreamers”: grown-ups who were brought to America illegally as children. There is strong public sentiment, on humanitarian grounds, for not shipping them back to countries they have never known, and it seems likely that Congress will work out a path for them to remain in the U.S. Retaining the Dreamers, however, wouldn’t be enough to ensure that the U.S., with its low population growth, has a sufficient workforce to support the economic growth it needs to maintain the welfare state. The situation described by the Social Security trustees isn’t going away. To the contrary, addressing it is becoming more urgent, and more rather than less liberal immigration policies are one way to do that.",0
2625,"Reuters","President-elect Donald Trump salutes the statue of Abraham Lincoln as he and his wife Melania take part in a Make America Great Again welcome concert in Washington.
Donald Trump is preparing to sign executive actions on his first day in the White House on Friday to take the opening steps to crack down on immigration, build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border and roll back outgoing President Barack Obama's policies.
Trump, a Republican elected on Nov. 8 to succeed Democrat Obama, arrived in Washington on a military plane with his family a day before he will be sworn in during a ceremony at the U.S. Capitol.
Aides said Trump would not wait to wield one of the most powerful tools of his office, the presidential pen, to sign several executive actions that can be implemented without the input of Congress.
""He is committed to not just Day 1, but Day 2, Day 3 of enacting an agenda of real change, and I think that you're going to see that in the days and weeks to come,"" Trump spokesman Sean Spicer said on Thursday, telling reporters to expect activity on Friday, during the weekend and early next week.
Trump plans on Saturday to visit the headquarters of the CIA in Langley, Virginia. He has harshly criticized the agency and its outgoing chief, first questioning the CIA's conclusion that Russia was involved in cyber hacking during the U.S. election campaign, before later accepting the verdict. Trump also likened U.S. intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany.
Trump's advisers vetted more than 200 potential executive orders for him to consider signing on healthcare, climate policy, immigration, energy and numerous other issues, but it was not clear how many orders he would initially approve, according to a member of the Trump transition team who was not authorized to talk to the press.
Signing off on orders puts Trump, who has presided over a sprawling business empire but has never before held public office, in a familiar place similar to the CEO role that made him famous, and will give him some early victories before he has to turn to the lumbering process of getting Congress to pass bills.
The strategy has been used by other presidents, including Obama, in their first few weeks in office.
""He wants to show he will take action and not be stifled by Washington gridlock,"" said Princeton University presidential historian Julian Zelizer.
Trump is expected to impose a federal hiring freeze and take steps to delay a Labor Department rule due to take effect in April that would require brokers who give retirement advice to put their clients' best interests first.
He also will give official notice he plans to withdraw from the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, Spicer said. ""I think you will see those happen very shortly,"" Spicer said.
Obama, ending eight years as president, made frequent use of his executive powers during his second term in office, when the Republican-controlled Congress stymied his efforts to overhaul immigration and environmental laws. Many of those actions are now ripe targets for Trump to reverse.
BORDER WALL
Trump is expected to sign an executive order in his first few days to direct the building of a wall on the southern border with Mexico, and actions to limit the entry of asylum seekers from Latin America, among several immigration-related steps his advisers have recommended.
That includes rescinding Obama's order that allowed more than 700,000 people brought into the United States illegally as children to stay in the country on a two-year authorization to work and attend college, according to several people close to the presidential transition team.

It is unlikely Trump's order will result in an immediate roundup of these immigrants, sources told OutletName. Rather, he is expected to let the authorizations expire.
The issue could set up a confrontation with Obama, who told reporters on Wednesday he would weigh in if he felt the new administration was unfairly targeting those immigrants.
Advisers to Trump expect him to put restrictions on people entering the United States from certain countries until a system for ""extreme vetting"" for Islamist extremists can be set up.
During his presidential campaign, Trump proposed banning non-American Muslims from entering the United States, but his executive order regarding immigration is expected to be based on nationality rather than religion.
Another proposed executive order would require all Cabinet departments to disclose and pause current work being done in connection with Obama's initiatives to curb carbon emissions to combat climate change.
Trump also is expected to extend prohibitions on future lobbying imposed on members of his transition team.'THE HIGHEST IQ'
Washington was turned into a virtual fortress ahead of the inauguration, with police ready to step in to separate protesters from Trump supporters at any sign of unrest.
As Obama packed up to leave the White House, Trump and his family laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery and attended a concert at the Lincoln Memorial.
Trump spoke earlier to lawmakers and Cabinet nominees at a luncheon in a ballroom at his hotel, down the street from the White House, announcing during brief remarks that he would pick Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets of the National Football League, as U.S. ambassador to Britain.
""We have a lot of smart people. I tell you what, one thing we've learned, we have by far the highest IQ of any Cabinet ever assembled,"" Trump said.
Trump has selected all 21 members of his Cabinet, along with six other key positions requiring Senate confirmation. The Senate is expected on Friday to vote to confirm retired General James Mattis, Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon, and retired General John Kelly, his homeland security choice.
Senate Republicans had hoped to confirm as many as seven Cabinet members on Friday, but Democrats balked at the pace. Trump spokesman Spicer accused Senate Democrats of ""stalling tactics.""
Also in place for Monday will be 536 ""beachhead team members"" at government agencies, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said, a small portion of the thousands of positions Obama's appointees will vacate.
Trump has asked 50 Obama staffers in critical posts to stay on until replacements can be found, including Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work and Brett McGurk, envoy to the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State.
The list includes Adam Szubin, who has long served in an ""acting"" capacity in the Treasury Department's top anti-terrorism job because his nomination has been held up by congressional Republicans since Obama named him to the job in April 2015.
The Supreme Court said U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, who will administer the oath of office on Friday, met with Trump on Thursday to discuss inauguration arrangements.",0
57,"FoxNews","A new report from OutletName on Tuesday shows the extraordinary measures President Trump inquired about as part of his push to secure the southern border. In an excerpt from their upcoming book, ""Border Wars: Inside Trump’s Assault on Immigration,"" Times reporters Michael Shear and Julie Hirschfeld Davis allege that Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of installing a ""water-filled trench"" filled with deadly reptiles. ""Privately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh,"" the excerpt read. ""After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That’s not allowed either, they told him."" A source who was in the room at the time confirmed the conversation about shooting migrants in the legs to OutletName late Tuesday. The Times journalists said that their report was based on interviews with ""more than a dozen White House and administration officials directly involved"" in discussions that took place at the time. “You are making me look like an idiot,” Trump reportedly shouted at the meeting. ""I ran on this. It’s my issue.” The president also reportedly trashed his then-Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who left the administration in April. The report details about efforts made by top White House advisor Stephen Miller to ""get rid"" of administration officials he thought were thwarting Trump's immigration agenda, which included Nielsen, then-United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) chief L. Francis Cissna, DHS general counsel John Mitnick, and former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Ronald D. Vitiello, all who have since left the administration. The White House did not immediately respond to OutletName' request for comment.",1
58,"FoxNews","In the span of just a few months, the idea of providing health care to illegal immigrants has morphed from a fringe, left-wing fancy to a plank of many 2020 Democrats' presidential campaigns -- but it’s a proposal that one study predicts would cost American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year. A standout moment of the June 27 Democratic primary debate was that of all the candidates on the stage raising their hands, signifying support for government health care plans including “undocumented” immigrants. Republicans and the White House have seized on that moment, with President Trump declaring it “the end of the race.” But with the campaign definitely not over, and a number of frontrunners now backing the policy, more attention is turning to how much it could cost to give millions of illegal immigrants health insurance. On Thursday, the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), a policy group that advocates for lower levels of immigration overall, published a study finding that the cost could be up to $23 billion a year. While candidates have not necessarily gone into detail about their plans, CIS cites an Atlantic survey that found that Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro would all provide “full benefits” to those in the country illegally. The CIS study estimated that 4.9 million illegal immigrants have incomes below 400 percent of the poverty line and also do not have insurance -- meaning they have incomes low enough to receive coverage via either Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act -- also known to many, particularly critics, as ObamaCare. The study estimates that if all income-eligible, uninsured illegal immigrants received subsidies under the ACA, then the cost to insure would be $22.6 billion, but with “likely enrollment” of 46 percent, the total cost would be perhaps $10.4 billion a year. It predicts that the average cost of a subsidized premium would be $4,637. If a mixed approach of ACA subsidies and Medicaid enrollment were used, the cost would dip to $19.6 billion with 100 percent enrollment, and $10.7 billion assuming “likely enrollment.” These numbers could change significantly if a more overarching health care overhaul is passed by a future Democratic White House and Congress. “Numbers aside, the fact that presidential candidates are advocating spending billions of dollars on people who are in the country illegally is significant in its own right,” the report concludes. “It suggests that allowing in large numbers of less-educated workers will inevitably generate significant political pressure to provide them access to social programs.” Extending health care to illegal immigrants could, however, be only one part of the cost to taxpayers of more generous social policies being pushed by Democrats. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who was an early champion of left-favored policies now finding their way into 2020 Democratic platforms, recently introduced a new package of policies known as the “Just Society.” Among those bills is “The Embrace Act,” which would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as U.S. citizens and those in the country legally. ""Notwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual’s immigration status,” the bill reads. The bill defines a federal public benefit as: “any grant, contract, loan, professional license or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; and ... any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post-secondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit,or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.”",1
1444,"WSJ","When President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week cutting funding for foreign organizations that perform abortion, Catholic leaders cheered, convinced the new administration would be an ally on that core issue. But on another key issue for Catholics—immigration—church leaders and the new administration are in conflict. The Roman Catholic church is positioning itself as a bulwark against any efforts to crack down on immigrants and refugees. At parishes across Los Angeles, volunteers are teaching unauthorized immigrants about their legal rights. In El Paso, Texas, the local bishop helped lead a recent interfaith prayer service in solidarity with undocumented immigrants. And Catholic organizations have quickly denounced Mr. Trump’s executive orders to beef up immigration enforcement and start work on a wall along the Mexican border, as well as his order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries that sowed chaos across U.S. airports over the weekend. “This weekend proved to be a dark moment in U.S. History,” Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago considered a close ally of Pope Francis, said in an emailed statement on Sunday. “The executive order to turn away refugees and to close our nation to those, particularly Muslims, fleeing violence, oppression and persecution is contrary to both Catholic and American values.” He added, “The world is watching as we abandon our commitments to American values.” On issues like abortion, contraception and religious exemptions for businesses that don’t want to provide services at gay weddings, Catholic leaders hope to find far more common ground with Mr. Trump than they did with the previous administration. Several members of the Trump administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, spoke Friday at the March for Life, an annual antiabortion rally in Washington. Father Frank Pavone, a Catholic priest who runs the antiabortion organization Priests for Life and was part of Mr. Trump’s Catholic advisory committee during the campaign, said at Friday’s march that there was a “hierarchy” of issues for Catholics, and he believed abortion should be at the very top. He added, “I think there should be a wall. There should be a clear signal sent that people who are breaking the law should be punished.” Still, opposition from Catholic leadership on Mr. Trump’s immigration policies, which were a centerpiece of his campaign, could be problematic for the president given that Catholic voters were a vital part of his wining coalition. The Catholic church largely depends on Hispanic immigration to buoy its U.S. numbers, and Catholic charity organizations are among the nation’s largest providers of refugee resettlement services. In the wake of Mr. Trump’s executive orders, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops’ refugee program, which resettles roughly a quarter of refugees coming into the country, stands to lose as much as $40 million in federal funding, according to the program’s executive director. At least one Catholic church, St. Agnes Church in San Francisco, is offering sanctuary to immigrants facing deportation, joining a sanctuary movement at houses of worship of various faiths that has exploded since Mr. Trump’s election. In Los Angeles County, the largest Catholic archdiocese in the country and home to more than 800,000 undocumented immigrants, Archbishop José Gomez has repeatedly spoken about immigration this month, with emphasis on the importance of seeing the humanity in people seeking shelter in the country. “It’s not a matter of building walls,” he said during a speech at the University of California, Los Angeles, the night before the inauguration. “We’ve tried that over and over again. It doesn’t work.” A wide array of religious figures—including Jews, Muslims and some Protestants, as well as Catholics—have also criticized Mr. Trump’s executive orders on immigration and refugees. The orders greatly expanded the group of immigrants targeted for deportation; directed federal agencies to pull funding from cities that refuse to assist immigration authorities; suspended intake of all refugees for 120 days; and indefinitely halted anyone from a number of Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq and Syria, from entering the U.S. Late Saturday, a federal judge blocked part of the ban on people from Syria and other Middle Eastern countries entering the U.S. In an interview, Archbishop Gomez—a vocal opponent of abortion, as well as an advocate of an overhaul of immigration laws—said fear had surged among parishioners since Mr. Trump’s election. A pamphlet distributed by the archdiocese outlines the right to a lawyer, advises immigrants to develop an emergency plan in case someone in the family is detained, and offers tips, in English and Spanish, on dealing with immigration authorities at home. (“Do not open the door!!” it says. “If it is immigration, they are not allowed to enter for any reason unless you open the door or give them permission to enter.”) Similar classes are being held elsewhere in the country, including by Catholic charity groups in the San Francisco Bay Area. Still, Archbishop Gomez, who was recently tapped for a leadership position in the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which will guide the church’s relationship with the Trump administration, said he was hopeful that “this challenging situation is going to bring good.” “It’s more in the public eye now,” he said. “The last administration deported millions of people and nobody said anything. Now there’s talk about building a border wall, and everyone’s talking about it. So immigration is becoming a hot issue, a priority.” A majority of Christians of all denominations—including 73% of Catholics—say undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. should be legally allowed to stay, according to a 2015 study from the Pew Research Center. In a letter to priests in his archdiocese, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the archbishop of Washington, D.C., linked the church’s fight against abortion to its commitment to refugees, though he declined to directly criticize Mr. Trump. “Last Friday at our Rallies and Masses for Life, and at the March for Life, our voices—our presence—could not be ignored in the defense of the unborn and life at every stage,” he wrote. “So too now do we raise our voices in support of all refugees, especially those fleeing religious persecution.” Ashley Feasley, director of policy for migration and refugee services for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, was optimistic that people who were brought to the country illegally as children wouldn’t be targeted for deportation. The Obama administration offered legal protection to many unauthorized immigrants who arrived as children, and Mr. Trump has, thus far, taken no steps to reverse that action. The Trump administration didn’t respond to requests for comment. “Hopefully there will be a solution that enables them to stay in our country, and to be able to continue working and going to school and serving in the military, without fear of deportation or family separation,” Ms. Feasley said.",0
685,"Daily Caller","Normally, I drive across the border from San Diego, California, to and from Tijuana, Mexico. Recently, a broken arm prevented me from driving, so I joined the tens of thousands of Mexicans and Americans who walk through the San Diego Port of Entry at San Ysidro.
Mexico-bound drivers are rarely checked by Mexican Immigration, but pedestrians are regularly checked. Americans must present a passport. I use my passport “card” issued by the United States for land border crossings with Mexico and Canada.
One must be a U.S. citizen to have a U.S. passport or passport card. Such documents prove U.S. citizenship.
When the Mexican immigration officer looked at my card, she waved me through stating, “You are Mexican.” The card clearly states my birth nation as MEXICO. No interviews, no lawsuits or adjudication. My own U.S. passport declares me to be a Mexican citizen. Why?
Mexico has its own version of the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment. If a child is born in Mexico, the child is a Mexican citizen upon his or her 18th birthday. So, Mexico and the United States are, perhaps, the world’s most advanced constitutional republics.
Now, why can’t some people read and comprehend our laws and our Constitution? Don’t they understand its “supremacy” clause?
In a phrase, federal law trumps local and state law; federal law is supreme.
Specifically, it’s about arguments that American children born of undocumented immigrants should be denied natural-born citizenship; that they should be denied “due process” and “equal enforcement of the law.”
Article 1 of the 14th Amendment states clearly that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside…”
Anyone who argues that a child born to one or more illegal alien parents in the United States is not a U.S. citizen is wrong. Some say people who hold such views are brainless.
Further, anyone who claims these children and their undocumented parents are not under United States “jurisdiction” are constitutionally illiterate.
Can illegal aliens be arrested for crimes? Must their children have birth certificates? Must their children produce certificates of vaccination to enter school? Must they have a license to drive? Must the children attend school per laws in all states?
Has the Supreme Court considered this argument? Yes, many times. Let’s begin with the argument that the 14th Amendment applies only to Blacks who were pre-1863 slaves or their children. The Court dispensed with this argument in the Slaughterhouse Cases in the 1870s.
Insofar as specified constitutional rights, it ruled that laws apply to all, not just certain favored groups regardless of the circumstances or legislative intent.
The federal court dispensed with the racial argument involving Mexicans in IN RE RICARDO RODRIGUEZ . The racial element argument that Mexicans were not white, thus not eligible for citizenship per 1846 federal law, was the position of Texas.
The court dispensed with that argument by Texas when it ruled that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) — like all treaties — had the force of the Constitution and overruled any other law.
In the 1898 Wong Kim Ark case, the Supreme Court spoke decisively on the 14th Amendment. A California child born of Chinese immigrants whom law prevented from becoming citizens traveled to China. On returning to the United States, despite his birth in the United States, he was denied entry because his parents were Chinese. He was a “Chinese person.”
The court took great pains to elaborate on the history of citizenship in Great Britain, of British Common Law on the subject and what laws were in effect when the United States came into being.
It detailed dozens of Supreme Court decisions since 1804 that examined citizenship, concluding that, even before the 14th Amendment, children born in the United States were citizens unless they were born to foreign diplomats, American tribal Indians, on foreign ships in American waters or to women accompanying invading military forces.
The huge exception, of course, was the 1857 Dred Scott decision that ruled that Africans could not be citizens because they were either property or were not white, period. That issue was addressed by the Civil War and was overturned by Americans wearing blue uniforms.
The 14th Amendment was written in blood.
To the argument that it applied only to slaves and their children, evidence abounds that the Senate considered foreigners and many quotes exist in the congressional publication of the day that refers to “the strangers among us, Gypsies and Chinese.” Nonetheless, some argue that only black Americans were covered by the 14th Amendment.
Of course, the 14th’s wording alone destroys that argument: “ALL PERSONS BORN OR NATURALIZED in the United States.” “All” means all. Doesn’t it?
The 400 years of British and American court decisions, the laws and the Constitution mean nothing to those who question whether the 14th applies to almost all children born here. They would garner more support if they applied their faulty thinking to children of felons, murderers and traitors like spies Aldrich Ames and the Walker Family who sold out our nation to Russia.
They see mostly Mexicans; some see Central Americans. They have concocted “anchor babies,” a term that defines American-born children of illegal aliens as something other than a citizen as defined by the Constitution.
“Anchor babies” is the 21st Century version of the 18th Century British and American “n-word.”
The words themselves are blatant proof that those who use the term “anchor babies” are racists. You see, “anchor babies” are not defined in law or in the Constitution; they simply exist in the minds of people who hate Mexicans (and Central Americans) and need something to equate to their despicable, racist term for those of African descent.
These are the same people who gather by torchlight and chant “Jews will not replace us!” The chanters and their fellow travelers are a curse on our nation.",1
511,"Breitbart","The Brooks County Sheriff’s Office reported the recovery of three deceased migrants this week. The discoveries raised the migrant death toll for this county located about 80 miles inland from the Mexican border to five for 2019.
On February 17, Brooks County Sheriff’s Office Deputy Bianca Mora received information about the discovery of a deceased migrant in the southwest part of the county, according to information provided by sheriff’s office officials. This is a known area for drug smugglers to drop off their human cargo to have them march around the Falfurrias Border Patrol Checkpoint.
Deputy Mora met Border Patrol agents and a justice of the peace at the scene four miles into the ranch where she observed a deceased male lying face down in a wooded area. She reported that the partially disrobed migrant wore a purple plaid shirt, grey boxers, blue jeans with a khaki belt, and black socks. Shoes were found near the body along with a cellphone, a charger, a yellow wallet containing a Mexican identification card, a silver chain with a round pendant, eyeglasses, a wristwatch, and a prescription pill container.
The justice of the peace made the statutory death pronouncement and the local funeral home representatives took custody of the body.
Mora noted the identification card belonged to 57-year-old Daniel Quintero Ochoa. It is not known if that is the identity of the deceased migrant and the face had decomposed beyond recognition from being face-down in the dirt.
The Webb County Medical Examiner’s Office in Laredo, Texas, will provide autopsy services for Brooks County and will attempt to confirm the deceased’s identity.
Three days earlier, Deputy S. Rosas and Training Officer B. Gomez received information about the discovery of skeletal remains on a ranch located near the Border Patrol checkpoint. The deputies met Border Patrol agents at the scene located about 1.2 miles into the ranch, sheriff’s officials reported. The deputies found skeletal remains scattered by animals over a wide area. Deputies found a small quantity of foreign currency at the scene.
Deputy Rosas gathered the skeletal remains and personal items and placed them in paper evidence bags. The remains will be transported to the Webb County Medical Examiner’s office who will attempt to make an identification from the remains.
On February 11, Deputy Robert Castanon received notice of the discovery of the skeletal remains of a third deceased migrant. These remains were located on the same ranch as the February 14 discovery. Castanon met a Border Patrol agent at the scene located about 4.5 miles inside the ranch.
The agent led the deputy to the location of what appears to be a female migrant based upon items of clothing found at the scene. The bones and skull were found in a wide area after being scattered by animals. In addition to the skeletal remains, the deputy found a woman’s silver ring with a pink stone, a white bra, a small blue bag made from cloth, and an assortment of change, the report states.
The deputy gathered the remains and personal effects of the deceased migrant and placed them in evidence bags for transportation to the Webb County Medical Examiner’s Office who will attempt to identify the deceased.
The discovery of the three sets of human remains brings the migrant death toll for this year in this single county located about 80 miles from the Texas border with Mexico to five.
Border Patrol officials also found the body of a migrant who drowned in the All-American Canal in Southern California this week, OutletName News reported on Thursday.
The International Organization for Migrants’ Missing Migrant Project reports that at least 21 migrants have been found dead in incidents connected to smuggling migrants across the border into the U.S.– 18 of those were found near the Texas border.

“Interesting that he drops this proposal with a week to go until the Nov. 6 election,” O’Rourke replied.
During a Monday TV interview, Trump announced his intentions to sidestep adding a constitutional amendment to modify the 14th Amendment’s provision of birthright citizenship for persons born in the United States. O’Rourke pivoted away from Trump’s executive order proposal and brought up the more than 5,000 person migrant caravan that is traveling through Mexico with the hope of claiming asylum in the U.S.
“Interesting that he tries to stoke paranoia and fear about a group of migrants who are still hundreds of miles, weeks away from the U.S.-Mexico border if they even make it this far,” O’Rourke said.
“I think he’s trying to play upon the worst impulses of this country instead of speaking to our ambitions, our hopes, our dreams — those things that we can achieve if we all come together, so I don’t know what he’s trying to do, I just know the task left to us, which is to be the answer to that,” he continued.

The statement follows President Donald Trump’s threat of raising a 5 percent tariff if Mexico does not strengthen its borders. On Monday evening, Mexico’s Foreign Relations Secretariat posted a statement claiming the country was effectively providing humanitarian visas to Central American migrants and strengthening immigration enforcement operations in southern Mexico. “Without these important Mexican efforts in immigration matters, the U.S. would receive 250,000 additional migrants, only in 2019,” the prepared statement revealed. The veiled threat was buried at in the middle of a document where Mexican officials claimed to have deported more than 80,000 migrants and arrested 400 suspected smugglers in conjunction with U.S. officials. As OutletName News reported, U.S. immigration authorities are apprehending record-setting groups of migrants in a trend that is expected to reach more than 1 million persons by the end of fiscal year 2019.

742,"Daily Caller","MSOutletName host Ali Velshi compared Americans’ feelings toward illegal immigration to Germany and Rwanda during a segment on his show Tuesday afternoon with OutletName correspondent Morgan Radford.
They were discussing how hot topic issues like heath care and immigration could impact the midterms in a from week.
“When you talk about the economy or you talk about health care, it’s remarkably experiential, right? I often say the economy is your economy, whatever economy you have you’re feeling, right? But immigration is not that to a lot of people. Many people to whom immigration is the highest priority don’t have a negative experience with immigration,” Velshi stated.
“Which is what’s interesting, right? Because I’ve been covering these MAGA rallies. What it seems to boil down to just as a reporter watching this is about safety. Not only safety in terms of your personal and social position but also in terms of your pocketbook and in some cases crime. But we’re kind of seeing people create these oppositions out of things that they’re not necessarily —” Radford responded.
“And otherness, which by the way, we’ve seen all through history, in Germany, in Rwanda, in the Balkans and otherness, when people feel insecure, identify some group,” Velshi added.
While the MSOutletName host didn’t specify, his comparison to Rwanda is likely in regards to the Rwandan genocide in the mid 1990s. According to United To End Genocide, approximately 800,000 Tutsis and Hutus were murdered during a “carefully organized program of genocide over 100 days.” His other comparison to Germany is probably a reference to the Holocaust.
Redford continued, “And the cognitive dissonance, right? I’m sitting there interviewing a woman at the last MAGA rally and she says, you know, I don’t mind Latinos, looking at me, but, you know, they have a very matriarchal society she says and I even like their food, but I don’t want them coming here if they cross the border. So it’s an interesting kind of like cognitive dissonance you see with maybe someone you haven’t met before.”",1
1369,"WSJ","During Mr. Trump’s first year in office, the Department of Homeland Security commissioned eight border-wall prototypes. Four concrete designs and four with “other materials” were ultimately built in a patch of desert just north of an existing border fence in San Diego. The eight prototypes remain in place. Though some older fencing has been replaced along the Mexican border, none of the new construction includes any elements from the 30-foot-by-30-foot prototypes. Instead, older fences, including dilapidated sheets of steel designed to be used as landing mats during the Vietnam War, have been replaced with sections of 30-foot-high steel posts set about an inch apart—a design that allows Border Patrol agents to see through the structure. More replacement projects and some additional fencing are expected to be built along the border in the coming year.",0
1348,"WSJ","An organized protest march of about 1,000 Central American migrants slowly traveling through Mexico toward the U.S. border has become a hot-button political issue in Washington, straining bilateral relations with Mexico. The march is an annual event that organizers say aims to raise awareness about the tens of thousands of Central Americans who, facing gang violence and political unrest in one of the world’s most violent areas, flee every year to Mexico or the U.S. Many are turned back, extorted or kidnapped along the way. As in past years, the marchers intend to lodge asylum claims with the U.S., organizers said. This time around, however, the caravan caught the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who took to Twitter to blast it shortly after a news story aired on OutletName. “Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL!” On Monday, Mr. Trump cited the “caravan” on Twitter again, saying the U.S. immigration system was out of control and urging Congress to pass tougher immigration and border laws. Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for failing to pass legislation protecting young undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children, while also declaring his own opposition to such a deal. Mr. Trump announced an end to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program last fall. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray responded to Mr. Trump’s comment Sunday with a tweet of his own denying that his government was doing nothing to control migration. “Every day Mexico and the U.S. work together on migration throughout the region. Facts clearly reflect this,” he said. “....Upholding human dignity and rights is not at odds with the rule of law.” On Monday Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, tweeted: “Working with Mexican officials to address the yearly illegal alien caravan. Exploring all options.” Most of the marchers are Hondurans fleeing crime and political persecution at home, said Josael Romero, a Salvadoran activist who runs a migrant shelter in the Mexican state of Sonora and is traveling with them as a representative of Pueblo sin Fronteras (People Without Frontiers), the advocacy group that organizes the march. He said the group has mounted dozens of treks through Mexico in the last 15 years. Most migrants in past groups have succeeded in entering the U.S. and petitioning the government for asylum, Mr. Romero said, adding that many of those applications were still being processed. Nearly 40,000 Central Americans from the troubled countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador sought asylum in the U.S. in 2016, nine times as many as in 2010, according to the most recent data available from the Department of Justice. Among those, Hondurans seeking asylum rose from 783 to 10,818 over the same period. Grants of asylum to past applicants from the region generally amount to less than 10% of the number who apply in any given year. “They want to stop us, but we will keep on fighting,” Mr. Romero said. “We’ve been moving along peacefully, and we haven’t lost faith.” The march comes as Mexican authorities have stepped up apprehensions and deportations of undocumented migrants across the country. Mexico deported 15,835 Central Americans in the first two months of this year, up from 14,797 in the same period a year earlier, according to government statistics. The vast majority were from Guatemala and Honduras. In all of last year, Mexican immigration authorities deported 95,497 foreigners for lack of proper documents, 81,999 of them Central Americans. In fiscal 2017, the U.S. deported 75,923 Central Americans and 128,765 Mexicans. Mexican authorities haven’t stopped the annual protest march because many of the migrants involved have started the process of seeking asylum or humanitarian visas in Mexico, so they aren’t in the country illegally, a senior Mexican immigration official said on Monday. “This isn’t a massive influx of irregular migrants,” the official added. “They can remain in the country and move around while their immigration situation is worked out.” This year’s group is slowly moving north along highways from southern Mexico to Baja California. Organizers say it will try to enter the U.S. at border crossings in Mexicali or Tijuana. The caravan has been setting up camp at night on sports fields and accepting food, medicine and water from supporters along the way. “We aren’t criminals, we are international workers,” caravan organizers shouted over the weekend, using microphones as the migrants marched toward Tapachula, in Mexico’s southern state of Chiapas, from the nearby border with Guatemala. The marchers have generated controversy in Mexico, too. Other organizations that work with migrants criticized the action for risking the lives and welfare of the marchers. Alberto Xicotencatl, the director of a migrant shelter in the Mexican city of Saltillo, said while he can’t condemn the caravans because their demands to protect migrants are legitimate, “we also realized that this type of mobilization often affects public opinion and policy in a negative way.” “We don’t think this sort of thing strengthens the movement to respect the human rights of migrants in Mexico,” he added. “You need a lot more than a caravan to do that.”",0
525,"Breitbart","OutletName News’ Border/Cartel Chronicles Director Brandon Darby slammed the spending resolution passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump last week, calling the measure a betrayal to supporters of increased border security. His comments came during an interview on OutletName News Tonight.
Darby explained that due to a provision in the spending bill Trump signed on Friday, it is “almost going to be impossible to deport” migrants who cross the border from Mexico “if they have a minor with them.”
“It’s going to be impossible to allow them to self-deport; it’s going to be impossible,” Darby told SiriusXM host Rebecca Mansour on Friday. “[Trump] really should have sought broader counsel before he signed it, and he didn’t.”
LISTEN:
Darby minced no words in his criticism of the president’s decision to sign the bill: “He screwed the pooch.”
Mansour laid out the problematic provision in the new law that Darby said makes it impossible to deport the migrants who arrive with a child, explaining that it “says basically, if you come with a child you cannot be deported — by child we mean anybody under the age of 18. This is basically telling human traffickers to attach a child to your migrant caravan and say that everybody that’s with that child is a family member, and you get in.”
Mansour said this provision puts the status even more plainly in the law. “Now, it’s literally in the law that if you have a child, you are not deported.” She called the new law “deportation Kryptonite.”
“This seems to be a total lure for human traffickers,” Mansour continued.
“We have to understand,” Darby responded. “There are a lot of bad people who cross that border. It is not a safe place. It is a very dangerous place in some areas.”
Darby cited a March 2014 article that reported the deportation of more than 7,000 sex offenders from Texas alone during a three-year period. More than a quarter of those committed sex offenses against children.
Darby wrote in the article about “a more concerning possibility — the sex offenders illegally entering the U.S. through the porous U.S./Mexico border are possibly being deported and coming right back to offend again.”
“What I am pointing out,” Darby continued in the radio interview, “is that there are thousands of bad people coming into our country — tens of thousands of good people — but thousands of bad people. All they have to do is kidnap a baby and they get to live in the United States now. That’s all they have to do, is show up with a kidnapped baby. We have no way to prove it — we’re not DNA testing, we have no way to prove it.”
“That is what we have just done, as a nation,” Darby stated. “That is what President Trump and our GOP, aside from some who voted against it–that is what they have just done to this nation.”
He went on to explain that the President codified “the worst things that inspire and encourage people to come to our border–the worst pull factors possible.”
During the interview, Darby also discussed the historical corruption of South Texas border county officials who now have veto power over the administration’s ability to build barriers in certain sections of the Rio Grande Valley Sector. Further, he discussed with Americans for Limited Government’s Rick Manning about the constitutional impact of a state like Texas declaring a state of emergency and the federal government’s constitutionally required response.
Darby also slammed the Trump Administration’s failure to take effective action against Mexican drug cartels–particularly the Gulf Cartel–which he stated derives substantial revenue from the smuggling of human beings into South Texas.
“I think Barack Obama did a better job of going after Mexican cartels than the Trump Administration has done,” Darby expressed. “There’s just no way to put lipstick on this pig. He screwed the pooch, and we’re in trouble.”
Darby’s entire interview with Rebecca Mansour and Rick Manning is available online. OutletName News Tonight airs on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9 p.m. to midnight Eastern.

1267,"WSJ","This community has long offered a generous hand to immigrants. But Maine’s largest city, population about 67,000, is now struggling with an influx of asylum seekers, to the point where a local official is alerting shelters in other parts of the country to discourage people from heading here. “The word is out there that our community is open to that population and has some assistance programs,” said David MacLean, administrator of Portland’s Social Services Division. “Our local resources are not able to keep up.” Asylum seekers, who are primarily from African countries, now make up 90% of the people living in Portland’s city-run family shelter and overflow shelter, where new arrivals sleep on mats. A city fund that assists with necessities is dwindling fast, and pro-bono lawyers are overwhelmed with cases, Mr. MacLean said. Portland’s strain comes as the number of asylum requests, in which people ask to be allowed to stay in the U.S. for humanitarian reasons, has ballooned. That is contributing to the well-publicized bottleneck at the Southwest border and the political clash over it. Portland’s challenge is expected to drive new debate around immigrant assistance in the state, where Democrats recently gained control of the legislature and the governor’s seat. Legislation recently filed by Democratic state Rep. Michael Brennan would beef up state assistance to asylum seekers. He said it would give them flexibility to settle in other Maine communities that need workers in the fast-aging state. But Jacob Posik, communications director for the Maine Heritage Policy Center, a think tank focused on limited government, cautions public officials not to overpromise. “We certainly need the help,” Mr. Posik said, referring to the state’s labor-force needs. “But if we’re attracting people to come here, we should certainly do it in a responsible way that isn’t strangling resources.” Jennifer Bailey, the asylum program director at the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project in Maine, which works with arrivals, said the migrants in Maine have typically come to the U.S. on visas. She also has seen an uptick of people presenting themselves to officials at the U.S. southern border to ask for asylum. “We have more cases than we’ve ever had,” she said. “The number of people coming is out of sync with resources.” President Trump and numerous administration officials have said lax asylum laws have encouraged migrants by the thousands to come to the U.S. illegally, but the administration has faced setbacks in attempts to limit asylum seekers. Maine, a slow-growing state known for lobsters and long winters, has for years looked to immigrants to boost the workforce and population. Immigrants now work everywhere from seafood plants to machine shops to manufacturing operations and run businesses in Portland, a trendy waterfront locale known nationally for its restaurant scene. The foreign-born population fueled more than 75% of population growth in Portland and the surrounding area in 2011-16, according to a report co-produced by the city. Portland has rejected the label of sanctuary city, citing its policy allowing for cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Asylum seekers, who apply once they are in the U.S., are generally ineligible for federal benefits until they get asylum, and are prohibited from working for at least six months after filing an asylum application. Preparing to file can itself take months because of challenges such as waits for legal help and difficulty getting documents from home countries, said Mr. MacLean, the social-services administrator. “What we find is that very quickly after they are able to get that work permit, they become self-sufficient,” he said. “The challenge is helping asylum seekers survive during their asylum-seeking process.” Under Maine law, asylum seekers who have filed an application may qualify for general assistance, for up to 24 months. Funded by the state and municipalities, that program provides vouchers for rent, utilities and other staples. In Portland, 65% to 70% of the 1,000 people now receiving general assistance are noncitizens, primarily asylum seekers, according to city staff. The city re-evaluates their eligibility every 30 days, and recipients must perform work for the city in return for the aid. Local nonprofits also help asylum seekers with needs, from winter coats to language classes. In addition, the city budgets about $200,000 annually to fill in gaps for asylum seekers who don’t qualify for general assistance, such as those who haven’t yet filed an application. By contrast, Portland’s new immigrants used to be predominantly refugees, Mr. MacLean said. Refugees remain outside the U.S. while their applications are considered. Once in the U.S., they qualify for an array of resettlement assistance and may work immediately. Refugee admissions are down sharply under President Trump. A 40-year-old asylum seeker, who recently came to the bare-bones overflow shelter, said he had worked for an oil company in Angola. He believed he was in danger because he voiced his views about government corruption and traveled to the U.S. on a visa with his three children and wife, a social worker, he said. He planned to seek asylum and had heard Portland was safe. “I hear they help people,” he said.",0
2495,"Reuters","Long before U.S. immigration authorities arrested 680 people at agricultural processing facilities in Mississippi this week, one of the five targeted companies faced allegations of serious labor violations including intimidation, harassment and exploitation of its largely immigrant work force, according to a federal lawsuit. Last August, Illinois-based poultry supplier Koch Foods settled a multi-year lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on behalf of more than 100 workers at the Morton, Mississippi, plant over claims the company knew - or should have known - of sexual and physical assaults against its Hispanic workers. Mark Kaminsky, chief operating officer at Koch, said the company admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement and maintains, after fighting the matter in court for more than eight years, that all the allegations contained in the lawsuit are false. The workers’ complaints spanned 2004 to 2008, when the plant employed more than 500 people. They alleged that a manager would grope women from behind while they were working, punch employees and throw chicken parts at them. Workers also alleged that supervisors coerced payments from them for everything from medical leave and promotions to bathroom breaks. Privately held Koch Foods, run by billionaire Joseph Grendys, in court filings called the claims of abuse and harassment “baffling” and “outrageous.” Kaminsky said a third-party review of 9 months of 24-hour video surveillance at the plant found “absolutely no evidence” of their veracity. Koch said the plaintiffs made uncorroborated claims against the company as a means to obtain U.S. visas for crime victims who collaborate with U.S. authorities that would allow them to stay legally in the United States. The company settled the allegations last year by paying $3.75 million and entering a three-year consent decree to prevent future violations. It agreed to implement new policies such as creating a 24-hour complaint hotline and publicly posting anti-discrimination policies, according to the EEOC. Some workers at the Mississippi plant who lacked legal immigration status alleged in court documents that supervisors threatened to turn them in to authorities if they spoke out about their concerns. Former federal officials and immigration attorneys said mass deportation operations like the ones conducted by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Wednesday in Mississippi can have a chilling effect on future labor complaints. “If workers are being threatened with being turned over to ICE, and then here comes ICE and arrests workers,” people could be more reluctant to speak up, said John Sandweg, a former acting ICE director during the Obama administration. In the EEOC lawsuit, one Koch Foods employee without legal immigration status alleged that a manager sexually harassed his wife and made him pay to use the bathroom, once waiting until he had soiled himself to give him permission to leave his spot on the production line. “If he found out that I had talked about anything that he was doing, charging money, the way he mistreated us, the dirty words he used; he told me that if I went to complain in the office that he had contacts in immigration,” the worker said in a 2012 deposition that was filed as part of the suit. “And that he knew where I lived.” Maria Cazorla, a Cuban immigrant and lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the company that was wrapped into the EEOC case, said in an interview on Thursday that a manager inappropriately touched her and hit her then-husband, also a co-worker, in the ribs while he was working. According to Cazorla’s interview and court documents, her husband at the time was targeted by management and fired over his immigration status after she filed her lawsuit against the company in 2010. Cazorla, now a U.S. citizen, left the company and Mississippi and now renovates houses in Florida. She said immigrants are often fearful of reporting abuse. “People are afraid to come forward because they think, ‘What will happen if I say something? I’ll be separated from my family, I’ll lose my job,’” Cazorla said. “They prefer to say nothing and suffer.” The EEOC enforces federal anti-discrimination laws and can investigate employee complaints. The agency tries to settle the claims but, if unsuccessful, it can file a lawsuit against employers for workplace discrimination. Marsha Rucker, EEOC Regional Attorney based in Birmingham, Alabama, who oversaw the lawsuit, said she did not believe the ICE action this week was connected to the EEOC’s civil complaint. SCENES OF MASS ARRESTS
The dramatic operation on Wednesday was the biggest workplace immigration sweep since December 2006, when ICE targeted meatpacking plants in six states and arrested almost 1,300 people. Some children of workers were left traumatized by their parents’ detention on what was for many the first day of school, according to local media reports. “Government, please,” an 11-year-old girl said on a OutletName News segment, weeping in front of a community center where she and other children were sent to spend the night. “My dad didn’t do nothing. He’s not a criminal.” President Donald Trump has made cracking down on immigration a centerpiece of his administration and said on Friday that actions like the one this week served “as a very good deterrent” to those in the country illegally. “When people see what they saw,” he said, “they know that they’re not staying here.” ICE officials told reporters on a call on Thursday that they had released 303 people for humanitarian reasons - if they were pregnant or a primary caretaker of children, for example. Among those released pending a hearing before an immigration judge were 18 “juveniles” who had been working in the plants, including one 14-year-old, ICE said. Koch Foods said in a statement on its website dated Thursday that it was cooperating with the government’s ongoing investigation following the ICE arrests. Koch said the Morton, Mississippi, plant employs more than 1,000 people and that the company is “diligent about its compliance with state and federal employment eligibility laws.” The company has been the target of ICE work site enforcement in the past. In August 2007, immigration agents arrested more than 160 employees of a Koch Foods chicken plant in Fairfield, Ohio, and was fined around a half a million dollars. At the time, ICE said Koch Foods was being investigated for federal crimes including encouraging, inducing or harboring immigrants in the United States illegally. Koch Foods, which according to its website is not affiliated with Koch Industries or the Koch brothers, started with 13 employees deboning and cutting up chicken in one room in 1985. It now counts more than 13,000 employees and bills itself as one of the biggest poultry processors in the United States, with facilities in Alabama, Georgia, Ohio, Tennessee and Illinois, as well as Mississippi. In a letter to the White House, the National Chicken Council - a lobbying group - said the poultry industry “uses every tool available to verify the identify and legal immigration status of all prospective employees.” But it said there was no government system available to “confirm with confidence that new hires are legally authorized to work in the United States.”",0
2188,"USA Today","Jilmar Ramos-Gomez was a lance corporal in the Marines and received awards for service in Afghanistan. Jilmar Ramos-Gomez was born and raised in Grand Rapids, joining the U.S. Marines after high school and becoming a decorated veteran who served in Afghanistan.
But despite his service — and despite being a U.S. citizen — Ramos-Gomez was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials for deportation after he was arrested on trespassing charges, said immigration attorneys. ICE and county officials had confused Ramos-Gomez, 27, with being an immigrant even though he had his U.S. passport and other ID on him at the time of his arrest.
Last month, after Ramos-Gomez was released on bond, ICE officials transported him from Kent County jail to an immigrant detention center in Calhoun County. He was set to be deported, until his mother contacted an attorney to rescue him from jail.
The detention has outraged his family and civil rights attorneys who say it's an example of how immigration and county officials have become overzealous in immigration enforcement. They also say it's an example of racial profiling of Latinos by immigration officials, and police.
Advocates with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Michigan Immigrant Rights Center sent a letter Wednesday to Kent County officials asking for documents and information about what exactly happened to the veteran Marine.
""I don't feel good about what they did to my son,"" Maria Gomez-Velaquez, his mother, told the Free Press during a phone interview. ""They were not listening to my son even though he had ID on him. It's not right. My son is from here, he's born here, a United States citizen. He served in the Marines, the military, but they don't care what my son did for his country.""
Maria Gomez speaks to the media at the office of attorney Richard Kessler in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Wednesday, Jan. 16, 2019. Gomez's son, Jilmar Ramos-Gomez, a U.S.-born Marine veteran was held for three days for possible deportation after pleading guilty to a disturbance at a western Michigan hospital. (Neil Blake/The Grand Rapids Press via AP) Officials with ICE, Kent County Sheriff, and Calhoun County Sheriff could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.
Kent County Undersheriff Chuck DeWitt told the Associated Press that ICE had contacted them to hold Ramos-Gomez. ""Once he was released from our custody, he was under the domain of ICE. Where they take him is their process,"" DeWitt said. ""Our procedures were followed.""
Former Marine has PTSD, episodes
Ramos-Gomez served in Afghanistan from 2011 to 2014 as a tank crewman and lance corporal. He was awarded a a global war on terrorism service medal, national defense service medal, an Afghanistan campaign medal, and a combat action ribbon, among other awards, said the ACLU.
""But when he returned home, he was a shell of his former self, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after what he had seen,"" according to an ACLU letter to Kent County officials. ""His family reports that he is focused on returning for his Marine brothers in Afghanistan.""
Ramos-Gomez developed some symptoms of PTSD after his service in Afghanistan and has ""episodes where he disappears and when he is found again, he often has no recollection of where he has been,"" the letter stated.
On Nov. 21, he was arrested after ""apparently damaging a fire alarm at Spectrum Health (in Grand Rapids) and trespassing on the heliport,"" said the letter by his supporters. ""The police report shows that Mr. Ramos-Gomez had his passport on him when he was arrested.""
He pleaded guilty to trespassing and on Dec. 14, a judge ordered him to be released on a personal bond. His mother, an immigrant from Guatemala, then went to pick him up from the jail.
When she arrived, she was told that ICE had put him on a bus to the immigrant detention center in Calhoun County in Battle Creek, more than an hour away.
The mother told them they made a mistake, that her son was a U.S. citizen who had lived in the U.S. his entire life. But moments later, she saw the immigration bus in the parking lot, leaving for Battle Creek with her son inside.
""I felt like I was ready to have a heart attack,"" said Gomez-Velaquez. ""I saw my son going in an immigration van and I don't believe it. I thought it's a joke.""
She then contacted an attorney, but since it was a Friday, her son was held there over the weekend.
On Monday, the attorney showed up and convinced them to release Ramos-Gomez after saying he had documents that clearly showed he was a U.S. citizen.
Why detain a U.S. citizen?
Ramos-Gomez's mother wants answers. ""What did they do to my son?"" she said.
Ramos-Gomez is currently staying at a hospital recuperating from PTSD issues, which his attorneys worry may have been made worse by his experience being detained by immigration officials.
""It is appalling that ICE would be so sloppy and callous and careless that they would target a U.S. citizen, a combat veteran who served his country and try to deport him from the very country he is serving,"" said Miriam Aukerman, a senior attorney at the ACLU of Michigan. ""It is absolutely outrageous.""
Hillary Scholten, an attorney with Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, said this case illustrates problems with what is known as the immigration detainers, in which ICE requests that local jails hold inmates beyond their release date if they are immigrants that officials want to detain and deport.
Immigrant advocates say that system is unconstitutional and leads to abuses. In Wayne County, the sheriff ended the detainer system in 2017 after concerns were raised by civil rights activists.
Aukerman said local ""jails should not volunteer resources to work with a deportation machinery that is sloppy, overzealous and makes mistakes with frightening frequency.""
In the case of Ramos-Gomez, ""he was supposed to be released, but Kent County held him for ICE,"" said Scholten.
Scholten said that county officials in Kent say that they are merely doing what ICE asked of them, but she said it's unclear how ICE arrived at the conclusion that Ramos-Gomez was an immigrant who should be detained. Who gave the information to ICE?, she asked. Or, she said, did ICE confuse him with another person?
According to a report last year in the OutletName, the problem of ICE detaining U.S. citizens is widespread, with ICE ""agents repeatedly targeting U.S. citizens for deportation by mistake, making wrongful arrests based on incomplete government records, bad data and lax investigations.""
This case also highlights the issue of Latinos who are U.S. citizens being profiled. The Free Press has reported how citizens who are Latinos are sometimes randomly stopped and interrogated by federal agents.
""It's fair to say it would be extremely unlikely that a Caucasian detainee would end up in immigration proceedings"" like Gomez-Ramos, who is Latino, did, said Aukerman.
While the mother of Gomez-Ramos is an immigrant from Guatemala, it's unclear what country ICE wanted to deport Ramos-Gomez to.
The ACLU's letter asks Kent County to provide an explanation of what happened to Gomez-Ramos at their next County Commission meeting on Jan. 24. ""Ramos-Gomez, his family, and the public all deserve to know how and why the Sheriff’s Department delivered Mr. Ramos-Gomez to ICE,"" the letter reads.
""Kent County is definitely very much at fault,"" said Scholten. ""They can't just blindly follow what ICE asks them to do.""",0
841,"Daily Caller","U.S. residents living near the southern border claim they are afraid to report immigration-related crimes to the police, detailing horrific stories of retaliation by Mexican cartels.
“I turned in 700 pounds [of marijuana] up here … I called it in [to Border Patrol]. They went and got it. That night, [the smugglers] came back. They … broke off all the floats off my troughs — chopped ’em up, drained all of it,” Billy Darnell, a cattle rancher in New Mexico, explained to the Washington Examiner.
Unlike other residents in the area, Darnell alerts the Border Patrol and local authorities whenever he sees an incident. However, the Hidalgo County cattle ranger says he has paid the price for talking.
Drug smugglers working for the cartels are constantly crossing the U.S-Mexico border, carrying marijuana and other illicit narcotics with them. Many times, smugglers will camp out and make use of property on the U.S. side of the border, clashing with American ranchers and residents.
After reaching out to residents living near the area, several told the Washington Examiner that reporting immigration-related crimes — such as burglary or finding drugs near their property — to the police can lead to retaliation. Fearing retribution, many of them forgo calling authorities altogether.
“I mix and mingle with these folks a lot,” said Joel Edwards, a Hidalgo County commissioner who said ranchers’ fears of retaliation by the cartels are legitimate. “That’s pretty much a real common feeling out there … I’ve heard it quite a bit in the last few weeks. They’re just scared.”
Another resident, Tricia Elbrock, believes cartel spotters camp out in the hills that overlook her home in Animas, New Mexico, and would know if she attempted to report suspicious activity. Elbrock has reported finding semiautomatic rifles, cellphones and satellite phones. However, she said she never approaches anything that is left on her property because people watching “could pick us off with a rifle.”
News of resident anxiety comes as lawmakers in Congress continue to debate border security and possible construction of a massive border wall.
After undergoing the longest shutdown in U.S. history, President Donald Trump relented and allowed the federal government to reopen in late January. However, Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have until Feb. 15 to reach an agreement or else face another shutdown. It’s not clear if Democrats will allow a comprehensive deal on border security to include funding for a border wall — something Trump has made clear is a deal-breaker. In the meantime, the president is wielding his executive authority to beef up security on the U.S.-Mexico border. The Pentagon announced Jan. 29 it was sending an additional 2,000 troops to the southwestern part of the border for a mission that will extend until Sept. 30. The Pentagon on Sunday announced another 3,750 U.S. troops to be deployed at the border.

2381,"USA Today","President Trump said he will issue a new executive order next week to revive his temporary shutdown of the U.S. refugee program and ban against admitting immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries. The Jan. 27 order has been blocked by federal judges.
During his press conference Thursday, Trump said he disagreed with rulings from two courts that have kept his order from being enforced since Feb. 3. But rather than continuing that legal fight, Trump said he will issue a new order that would survive legal scrutiny.
“The new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad (judicial) decision,” Trump said.
The Department of Justice confirmed that strategy in a brief it filed Thursday, saying it would not seek another appeal from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals due to the president’s upcoming order.
Trump’s executive order temporarily barred citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days, and Syrian citizens indefinitely. The order caused widespread chaos as people from those countries were detained at U.S. airports or prevented from boarding U.S.-bound flights around the world.In the days that followed, federal judges from Massachusetts to New York to Hawaii issued emergency stays prohibiting the Department of Homeland Security from implementing the order in their states. Then, on Feb. 3, District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued a nationwide temporary restraining order, arguing that Trump’s ban likely violated the due process rights of citizens from the seven countries who had become legal permanent residents of the U.S. or had entered the country on valid visas.
Trump bashed that ruling, calling Robart a “so-called judge.”
The next stop was the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel issued a unanimous ruling on Feb. 9 upholding Robart’s order. Trump also lashed out at those judges — two appointed by Democratic presidents, one by a Republican — accusing them of being politically motivated.
Trump said the temporary ban is necessary to give his intelligence agencies time to improve the screening process for foreigners trying to enter the country from terror-prone countries. He wants to institute “extreme vetting” procedures and said federal law gives him the power to suspend immigration from specific countries because it’s in the national security interests of the U.S.
Attorneys representing Washington state and Minnesota, which filed the lawsuit against Trump’s ban, conceded that presidents have broad powers to enforce immigration, but argued that Trump overstepped his authority. They said Trump’s order unfairly targeted people based on their religion as a result of his repeated promises to institute a “Muslim ban.” And they said foreigners legally allowed to be in the U.S. were not given an opportunity to challenge their right to enter the country.
One possible solution for Trump is to reissue a new order that only bars travel for people from those seven countries who have never entered the U.S. previously.",0
412,"Breitbart","The Texas Office of the Attorney General (OAG) confirmed to OutletName Texas that it is conducting an investigation into a possible violation of the state’s new sanctuary city law by San Antonio Police Chief William McManus. The investigation could lead to a criminal prosecution under the SB4 anti-sanctuary city law passed in the 2017 legislative session.
“Our office has received multiple complaints alleging that the San Antonio police chief violated Senate Bill 4, the Texas law prohibiting sanctuary city policies that the attorney general has authority to enforce,” OAG spokesman Mark Rylander said in response to an inquiry from OutletName Texas. “We have begun our investigation and demanded that the San Antonio Police Department preserve all of its records relating to the incident.”
The AG Ken Paxton’s office also sent a letter to the City of San Antonio demanding the preservation of any evidence that might be related to the case.
“Several citizens have filed complaints with the Texas Attorney General’s Office regarding an incident on December 23 involving the release of numerous suspected illegal aliens,” Assistant Texas Attorney General Cleve W. Doty wrote in the letter (attached below) which is also addressed to the San Antonio Police Department, City Council, City Manager Sheryl Sculley, City Attorney Andy Segovia, Mayor Ron Nirenberg, and Police Chief William McManus.
“The Texas Attorney General’s Office will investigate these complaints and the procedure in Senate Bill 4 contemplates litigation,” Doty continued. “We demand that you affirmatively preserve all relevant materials.”
The AG’s office is asking for records of all of the officers involved in the incident, any recordings of the incident, office and personal phone records of Chief McManus, his assistants, and the officers involved in the incident, and any orders Chief McManus gave to any subordinate officer regarding the incident or the illegal immigrants.
The letter demands written confirmation by Monday, January 15.
“This letter serves to warn you of your duty to preserve all relevant information pending an imminent, statutorily-mandated investigation,” Doty concluded in the letter.
In May 2017, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the nation’s toughest law prohibiting local police from interfering with immigration law enforcement.
“All law enforcement officers are going to be required to follow this law,” Governor Abbott told OutletName Texas in an exclusive interview immediately after signing the SB4 bill into law. “If they refuse to follow this law, or if they adopt sanctuary city policies, they are subject now to the stiffest penalties in America for adopting sanctuary city policies – which includes jail time where sheriffs could wind up in the same jail they may be releasing inmates from who are the subject of ICE detainer requests.”
The law provides both civil and criminal penalties for city and law enforcement officials who violate the law.
It appears this will be the first investigation by the Texas OAG into potential violations of the State’s new law.
“We finally have a higher authority looking into the chief’s conduct,” San Antonio Police Officers Association President Mike Helle told OutletName Texas on Thursday morning. “That is a good thing.”
Helle said there are several discrepancies between the information being handed out by Police Chief William McManus and what officers on the ground witnessed. “The staffs of our state’s leaders listened closely to what our officers had to say,” Helle explained. “They were not happy at all with what they heard.”",1
504,"Breitbart","Border Patrol agents assigned to the Laredo Sector rescued 22 illegal immigrants who were locked in the back of a box truck. The agents made the discovery at a Border Patrol checkpoint located between Laredo and San Antonio on Interstate Highway 35.
Agents assigned to the checkpoint observed a box truck approaching the inspection station. The agents became suspicious after questioning the driver and referred him to the secondary inspection station. During the inspection, agents discovered 22 illegal immigrants locked in the back of the truck, according to information obtained by OutletName Texas from U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials.
In many cases like this, the migrants are found to be overheated and dehydrated. These migrants were lucky. All appeared to be in good health, officials stated. The 22 illegal immigrants came to the U.S. via cartel-connected human smugglers. They arrived from Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala.
“These criminal organizations view these individuals as mere commodities without regard for their safety,” Laredo Sector Assistant Chief Patrol Agent Gabriel Acosta said in a written statement. “The blatant disregard for human life will not be tolerated. We will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to disrupt and dismantle these organizations and prosecute those responsible.”
Authorities identified the driver of the vehicle as a U.S. citizen. They did not release his name. The driver will likely be prosecuted for human smuggling.
Crossing into the United States illegally can be very dangerous, officials stated. “Our Border Safety Initiative (BSI) is a humanitarian, bi-national strategy designed to reduce illegal alien deaths, educate and inform potential illegal aliens of the dangers and hazards of crossing the border illegally, and to respond to those who are in life-threatening situations,” the statement concluded.
On February 22, OutletName Texas reported that Border Patrol agents and local sheriff’s deputies recovered the skeletal remains of four illegal immigrants who attempted to circumvent Border Patrol checkpoints in Falfurrias and Sarita, Texas.
“It is hard to determine how long these people lay in the fields after they died,” Brooks County Sheriff Benny Martinez told OutletName Texas. “Between the harsh climate, animals, and insects, a body decomposes to skeletal remains very quickly down here. The medical examiner should be able to help with establishing a better time of death.”
“These smugglers have no regard for human life,” the sheriff continued. “When a person gets sick, injured, dehydrated, or otherwise can’t keep up with the pack, the smugglers simply leave them behind to die.”",1
1279,"WSJ","Oscar Oswalvo Loera wakes up before dawn each day to pick lettuce, strawberries and other produce in the fertile fields surrounding this farm town. The home he walks out of is a former Econo Lodge, which used to cater to Highway 101 budget travelers. Now it sits at the intersection of two of California’s deepest and most polarizing issues: immigration and the lack of affordable housing. Motels, apartments and single-family homes in Santa Maria and other nearby towns are being converted to dormitory-style residences for temporary guest workers, tightening the supply of housing and pushing up already high rents. H-2A Visas Bring Workers to California Fields
Workers rise before dawn to ride buses provided by Betteravia Farms out to the fields to pick lettuce
As border security has tightened in recent years, agricultural companies in this farm town are relying less on illegal immigrant laborers and instead turning to a visa category called H-2A. Employers are required to provide housing that meets minimum standards as part of the H-2A program. “We have a lot of lower-income individuals renting rooms, trying to stay in hotels, and they have been displaced by H-2A workers,” said Corrie Lea Arellano, director of the Santa Maria office of California Rural Legal Assistance, a nonprofit legal services provider. The shortage of immigrant laborers is being felt in farm towns across the country but is particularly acute on California’s Central Coast, a swath between Los Angeles and San Francisco where there are crops to pick nearly year-round and agriculture employed an average of 70,900 workers last year. Like most of the state, the Central Coast has also been dealing with an affordable housing shortage for years. California hasn’t built enough apartments and homes to keep up with population growth, a problem critics blame on state and local regulations. Guest workers on H-2A visas employed by Betteravia Farms who reside in a converted Econo Lodge hotel relax after a day’s work harvesting in their employer’s fields.
The average monthly apartment rent in Santa Maria has risen 28% since 2015, hitting $1,735 in the first quarter this year, according to data firm RealPage Inc. The city in September declared a shelter crisis and applied for state assistance, saying its homeless population was growing because of “the high demand of H-2A housing and low vacancy rate.” Illegal immigrants have long been a backbone of the labor force here, as in many farming regions, and they usually find their own housing. They are among those concerned about being pushed out as more H-2A workers arrive and rents rise. Anger over guest workers taking housing is evident throughout the Central Coast. A 2014 restriction on converting apartments to H-2A housing in Guadalupe was recently upheld in a California appeals court, but legal fees have so far cost the tiny city more than $250,000. In Salinas, the city council last year debated and then tabled a measure that would have banned new properties from housing H-2A workers and instead this year passed an ordinance allowing them in hotels and motels. In Nipomo, a farmer canceled plans to purchase seven homes for migrant workers after a 2016 arson destroyed one of the properties. In addition to tighter border enforcement, the growth of H-2A and resulting low-end housing scramble is fueled by demographic changes in which fewer single men are coming to the U.S. from Mexico and more Central American families are arriving. In Santa Maria, the city council on Tuesday passed an ordinance placing restrictions on H-2A housing in residential neighborhoods and said it would consider another measure to compensate residents displaced by visa workers. Felipe Mendoza, a former field worker who is now a retired construction contractor, said it is uncomfortable for his granddaughter to visit and he worries about the value of his home since the house next door was renovated and 10 H-2A farmworkers moved in. “It’s a business, and it shouldn’t be here,” Mr. Mendoza said while pointing to the neighboring house from his carefully manicured lawn. Landlords often prefer H-2A workers to low-income residents, because farmers are willing to pay higher rents and do so more reliably, advocates for the poor said. A local family might pay between $1,400 and $1,500 for the same home where a farmer housing numerous guest workers could pay anywhere from $1,800 to $2,400, said Ms. Arellano. Mr. Loera, the Econo Lodge resident, said criticisms of housing reserved for migrants like him were hypocritical in a town reliant on the agricultural economy. “It is we Latinos who are those who come to do the hardest work,” he said while unwinding one evening by a picnic table, as colleagues and roommates nearby exchanged messages with family members back in Mexico on WhatsApp. Joe Leonard, the chief executive of Betteravia Farms, one of the Santa Maria Valley’s largest growers, said taking on the increased housing costs of the H-2A program is his only option. His existing workers, primarily immigrants, are growing old and finding other jobs, he said, while native-born Americans are unwilling to toil in the fields. A Mexican delegation arrived in Washington for meetings with U.S. officials to discuss immigration after President Trump threatened escalated tariffs on all Mexican imports unless it does more to stem the flow of migrants. OutletName's Louise Radnofsky looks at what's at stake for each side. Photo: OutletName
Use of the H-2A program has been steadily increasing in California in recent years, with the Labor Department certifying nearly 19,000 applications in fiscal 2018, up 24% from the prior year. Betteravia originally planned to use its own farmland to construct workforce housing, but California’s strict environmental regulations made that unfeasible, Mr. Leonard said. His next best option was the city of Santa Maria’s budget hotels. His company’s conversion of the Econo Lodge this year didn’t displace any low-income people, he said, but it nevertheless upset nearby residents. The City Council briefly weighed a ban on housing guest workers in hotels after some residents argued they should be placed outside the city. But activists have fought such proposals, saying they could result in labor camps that leave guest workers vulnerable. In the past, some farmers have been accused of not providing adequate housing for H-2A laborers. On North Broadway, the Laz-E-Daze Retirement Center was once a residential hotel that served low-income people, many with mental illness and substance-abuse problems. Now it has been converted to H-2A housing and many of its former tenants have cycled through Santa Maria’s largest homeless shelter, the Good Samaritan, said the facility’s executive director, Sylvia Barnard. Some locals are happy about the conversion of the Laz-E-Daze, now known as the Pasado del Sol. The neighborhood has become safer and cleaner, said Reina, a single mother of five from Mexico who came to the U.S. more than 20 years ago. Reina, who is not authorized to work in the U.S. and declined to share her last name, pays $1,100 a month for a two-bedroom apartment across the street. But she’s concerned that her building might soon also become H-2A housing. “It would be fatal,” she said. “I wouldn’t find a place fast enough.”",0
2499,"Reuters","Nearly a decade after receiving U.S. citizenship, Guatemalan-born Mayra Lopez thought she had cleared all the hurdles for her parents to join her in the United States. Then on Oct. 4 U.S. President Donald Trump changed the rules she and others had been complying with: Trump signed a proclamation requiring all prospective immigrants to prove they will have U.S. health insurance within 30 days of their arrival or enough money to pay for “reasonably foreseeable medical costs.” The new requirement, part of Republican Trump’s hard-line policies on immigration, goes into effect on Nov. 3 and prospective immigrants are scrambling to figure out how to get the necessary coverage, navigating a complex healthcare bureaucracy that has, for the most part, not previously catered to those who are not yet in the country. The administration gave scant detail about how the new requirements would be implemented beyond a bullet-point list of the types of insurance plans that would be accepted. A State Department notice on Oct. 29 said consular officers will verbally ask immigrant visa applicants to identify a specific health insurance plan, the date coverage will begin, and “other information related to the insurance plan as the consular officer deems necessary,” but gave the public only two days to comment on that plan instead of the usual several months. Lopez, 40, who works as a family assistant in California, and many others are finding few options exist for them. Lopez received a letter for her parents’ appointment to be interviewed on Nov. 25 at the U.S. embassy in Guatemala. Near the top it read: “inability to meet this requirement will result in the denial of the visa application,” according to the letter seen by OutletName. She immediately called her own insurer, Kaiser Permanente, but she said she was told her parents, both in their 60s with no serious health problems, would not be eligible because they did not have U.S. social security numbers and even if they did, it would cost more than $1,600 a month to cover both of them, according to interviews with Lopez and her attorney. Lopez then called five other insurers and began to panic when they all told her variations on the same thing, she said. Tony Barrueta, a Senior Vice President at Kaiser Permanente, said in a statement that a social security number is not required to apply for Kaiser Permanente coverage, but the company may request that information. Barrueta said the company acknowledges the complexity of the proclamation and other recent actions “and the confusion they may have created for many immigrants and their families.” He said they were continuing to educate their front-line staff on how to address questions. California’s health insurance marketplace, Covered California, said “consumers must be lawfully present in order to apply for coverage.” Many prospective immigrants seeking to enter the country legally, including those who do not have lawyers, may not be aware of the new requirements and could end up being denied, immigration advocates said. When asked about the concerns, a State Department official repeated the guidelines in the proclamation, which are posted on the department’s website. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. COVERAGE GAPS
Long term-plans on the state insurance marketplaces are not available to immigrants before they are in the country lawfully, according to the eligibility requirements outlined in the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature health care legislation. The proclamation does not accept subsidized health plans, meaning immigrant applicants would be barred from using income-based subsidies for the purchase of individual coverage, a main tenet of the ACA. Short-term insurance plans are banned in four states and 20 others limit their duration to less than 364 days, the amount of time required by the proclamation, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit research group. Even where they are available, short-term plans often have large gaps in coverage and can have exclusions for pre-existing conditions, said Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Jessica Altman. Trump has tested the boundaries of established policy, aiming to fulfill his 2016 campaign pledge to curb both legal and illegal immigration, including a yet to be constructed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Immigration rights lawyers and civil liberties groups have challenged his policies in court, sometimes with success. “This order overrides about 100 years of law that has always promoted the ability to live with your immediate family members and targets people in a way that Congress didn’t intend,” said Jesse Bless from the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “Congress has made rules that has allowed people to come in based on self sufficiency not wealth or health.” On Wednesday, seven U.S. citizens petitioning for their family members and immigrant advocacy groups filed a lawsuit in Oregon seeking to halt the proclamation. The proclamation appears squarely focused at limiting family-based migration, which the President has repeatedly derided as “chain migration,” said Xiao Wang, co-founder of the immigration firm Boundless. The administration issued a rule earlier this year that would limit legal immigration by expanding who could be found to be a “public charge” and barred from residency. The measure has been temporarily halted by federal courts. FAMILY REUNIFICATION DELAYS
Some immigration lawyers are telling their clients to consider rescheduling their visa interviews until there is more clarity about how the new health insurance rules would be implemented – potentially delaying family reunification. Some other wealthy countries, such as Germany, require people applying for visas and residency to provide proof of health insurance. But those countries do not have the same healthcare costs and insurance system as the United States. The Trump proclamation said it aims to stop healthcare providers and taxpayers from bearing “substantial costs in paying for medical expenses incurred by people who lack health insurance or the ability to pay for their healthcare.” It cited data that “lawful immigrants are about three times more likely than United States citizens to lack health insurance.” Healthcare policy experts say immigrants use the U.S. system less often than Americans. According to an analysis by Leighton Ku, Director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George Washington University, recent immigrants without insurance accounted for less than one-tenth of 1% of U.S. medical expenditures in 2017. Sometimes having short-term plans that provide only limited coverage can be as costly to the healthcare system as not having insurance at all, Pennsylvania’s Altman said. The Trump administration has expanded short-term health plans and made them renewable, which experts say undermines the ACA. Rajeev Shrivastava, the chief executive of VisitorsCoverage, which sells travel insurance policies to U.S. visitors and immigrants, said online search traffic for immigrant plans on his website increased by 150% after the proclamation. He said the new policy “creates an opportunity” for insurance companies to develop plans for incoming immigrants, though some are waiting for more clarity from the government. For U.S. citizens married to immigrants who have been living in the country without legal status there are additional considerations. Jorge, 45, has been in the United States for almost 20 years and is married to a U.S. citizen. He has been granted a so-called unlawful presence waiver that would allow him to leave and apply to become a legal resident without facing a multi-year bar. His visa interview in Colombia is scheduled for later this year. At least 10 insurers have told him he cannot apply unless he can prove he is in the country legally, Jorge said. He also does not qualify for travel insurance, he said, because he is currently in the United States. “This has been very stressful,” said Jorge, who spoke to OutletName on the condition that his last name not be used. One option available to him, a short-term health insurance plan that offers limited coverage, is only available for six months in Illinois and the proclamation requires coverage for 364 days. He bought it anyway.",0
2346,"USA Today","Of 678 people rounded up in 12 states during raids last week, 74% had been convicted of a crime. That is down from 90% of detained people with criminal records in 2016 under Obama, according to a OutletName analysis of more than a dozen federal raids.
For example, during a June 2016 raid conducted in six Midwestern states, 85% of the 324 people arrested had been convicted of crimes. During a raid in those same six states last week, 69% had criminal records.
The increase in arrests of those without criminal records does not appear to be consistent with Trump's promise after his election to use Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to target murderers, rapists and other ""bad hombres"" who pose serious threats to public safety.
Obama had taken a similar stance by focusing on criminal offenders. After 18 raids in 2016, ICE issued summaries noting that all the undocumented immigrants arrested were ""enforcement priorities"" who included convicted criminals, gang members, threats to national security, those who recently crossed the border and people with standing deportation orders.
In summaries of each of the five coordinated raids conducted last week, however, ICE explained it was taking a new course of action. ""During targeted enforcement operations, ICE officers frequently encounter additional suspects who may be in the United States in violation of federal immigration laws,"" the summaries said. ""Those persons will be evaluated on a case by case basis and, when appropriate, arrested by ICE.""David Leopold, a Cleveland immigration attorney and past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said exposing all undocumented immigrants encountered during raids for deportation represents a ""major shift"" in enforcement that takes the focus away from serious criminals and creates a sense of panic throughout the immigrant community.
""This is the blueprint for mass deportations,"" he said.
Mark Krikorian, executive director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors lower levels of immigration, said the shift is simply common sense. Krikorian, who has advised the Trump administration on immigration policy, said Obama correctly prioritized limited deportation dollars on the most serious criminals. But he said it was a mistake to limit the ability of ICE officers to arrest other undocumented immigrants caught during their operations.
""What's different now is that we've returned to normal enforcement practices where the 'bad hombres' are still job one, but ordinary lawbreakers are no longer exempt from enforcement,"" Krikorian said.
The ability of ICE agents to arrest undocumented immigrants encountered during their day-to-day jobs is laid out by orders from the president or the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.
Over the course of his eight years in office, Obama gradually restricted who ICE agents could apprehend. He created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2012, which granted deportation protections to more than 750,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. Then, in 2014, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson issued a memorandum outlining ""enforcement priorities"" and ordered ICE agents to only capture a limited group of undocumented immigrants.
That led to an increasing percentage of people deported under Obama with a criminal record. In 2011, about 67% of undocumented immigrants deported from the interior of the country had criminal records. The figure rose every year after that, hitting 92% in 2016.
All that changed on Jan. 25, when Trump signed an executive order vastly expanding the pool of undocumented immigrants considered ""enforcement priorities."" The new list added undocumented immigrants who have been charged with a crime but not convicted, those who have used fake Social Security numbers to find jobs or abused public benefit programs and people who ""otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.""
This week, new Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly reiterated Trump's earlier call to focus on the most dangerous undocumented immigrants. Kelly said ICE agents would have a ""specific focus on those who pose a threat to public safety.""
John Sandweg, a former acting director of ICE under Obama, said such pronouncements mean little to ICE agents working in the field. Instead, they operate under guidelines set forth by their superiors, in this case Trump's Jan. 25 executive order.
""The priorities are what govern the operations,"" said Sandweg. ""That’s how they’re graded, that’s how their compensation and benefits are awarded, that's how they’re promoted.""",0
1311,"WSJ","U.S. Customs and Border Protection plans to start awarding contracts by mid-April for President Donald Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico, signaling that he is aggressively pursuing plans to erect the barrier along the 2,000-mile border. The agency will request bids on or around March 6. Companies must submit “concept papers” to design and build prototypes by March 10, according to FedBizOpps.gov, a website for federal contractors. The field of candidates will be narrowed by March 20, and finalists must submit offers with their proposed costs by March 24. The president told the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday that construction would start “very soon” and is “way, way, way ahead of schedule.” The agency’s notice on Friday gave no details on where the wall would be built first and how many miles would be covered initially. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly has sought employees’ opinions during border tours of Arizona, California and Texas. It was unclear how soon Congress would provide funding and how much. The Government Accountability Office estimates it would cost on average $6.5 million a mile for a fence to keep out people who try to enter on foot and $1.8 million a mile for vehicle barriers. There are currently 354 miles of pedestrian fencing and 300 miles of vehicle barriers, much of it built during President George W. Bush’s second term. Republican leaders in Congress have said Mr. Trump’s wall would cost between $12 billion and $15 billion. Mr. Trump has suggested $12 billion. The price tag would depend on the height, materials and other specifications that haven’t yet been defined. Granite Construction Inc., Vulcan Materials Co. and Martin Marrieta Materials Inc. are seen as potential bidders. Kiewit Corp. built one of the more expensive stretches of fencing at a cost of about $16 million a mile, a project in San Diego that involved filling a deep canyon known as Smuggler’s Gulch. Cement maker Cemex SAB is also seen as a potential beneficiary even though it is based in Mexico.",0
1319,"WSJ","The Justice Department is quietly exploring new legal theories to take on so-called sanctuary cities in court, working to force them to aid the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation effort, people familiar with the discussion said. Such a case, if filed, would significantly escalate the Trump administration’s pressure campaign against recalcitrant cities and counties. The administration has already threatened to cut off federal funding to cities and counties that refuse to facilitate deportations, and it has sought to “shame” jurisdictions that don’t cooperate. If successful, the new court efforts would compel local authorities to assist federal immigration officers whether they want to or not. Separately, on Friday the Justice Department filed papers in support of the state of Texas’ defense in federal court of one of the toughest anti-illegal immigration laws in the nation. The statute, which is set to take effect in September, prohibits Texas cities and police departments from limiting their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Under that law, local Texas law-enforcement officials and sheriffs can face criminal penalties—including jail sentences—if they don’t comply with requests from federal authorities to detain suspected illegal immigrants until they can be transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody. Many cities and counties in Texas and across the country have adopted policies of not honoring these requests, called detainers. Several Texas cities, including Houston, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio and El Paso, challenged the law, saying it unconstitutionally infringes on the rights of local governments to police their own residents. The Justice Department argues the Texas statute doesn’t improperly pre-empt federal law or violate the Constitution. It plans to make those points in oral arguments in federal court in San Antonio Monday. “The Department of Justice fully supports Texas’ effort and is participating in this lawsuit because of the strong federal interest in facilitating the state and local cooperation that is critical in enforcing our nation’s immigration laws,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. Next week, Republicans will work to advance a similar goal via legislation. The House plans a vote on a measure that would deny certain federal grants from jurisdictions that don’t honor detainers, among other provisions. In April, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that Mr. Trump’s executive order threatening to pull funding from so-called sanctuary cities is likely unconstitutional. Separately, the Justice Department is developing legal strategies to invalidate sanctuary-city policies across the nation, according to several people familiar with the work under way. The goal, officials said, would be to win court rulings clarifying local jurisdictions’ requirements under federal law, effectively forcing them to abandon policies of not cooperating with federal officials. That strategy is complicated by the fact that the Justice Department has already said that detainers are requests of local authorities, not requirements. But the Justice Department is weighing a range of legal theories. A senior Justice Department attorney laid out the options under discussion. One possibility is to argue that local policies prohibiting cooperation with ICE wrongly pre-empt federal immigration law. Under another option, the department would argue that local authorities are discriminating against ICE because they are willing to honor detainers issued by other federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Drug Enforcement Administration. A third theory would argue that local governments are obstructing the federal government’s ability to do its job. The Justice Department attorney said a straightforward case arguing that local governments are required to honor detainers would likely succeed in front of some federal judges but not others. The official said the department is considering which circuits present the friendliest terrain. He added that as President Donald Trump puts more people onto the federal bench, the department’s chances may improve in certain circuits. Still, the official said, the Justice Department wants to ensure that any case its lawyers file could pass muster with the Supreme Court. A more limited option, the official said, would be to argue that a federal statute requiring open communication between local and federal officials, known as Section 1373, requires that local officials inform ICE when a suspected illegal immigrant is about to be released. Alternatively, the official said, the Justice Department could file a suit aimed at forcing local jails to let ICE officers into their facilities to investigate whether foreign-born suspects are citizens. Immigrant activists are skeptical that these suits would succeed. Greg Chen, director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, says Section 1373 is narrowly written merely to bar localities from prohibiting their personnel from sharing information about citizenship or immigration status with the federal authorities. “The language is specific and limited,” he said. Mr. Chen said he would need to know more about other legal theories under consideration to comment on how those suits might be defended. But he said most places that decline to honor detainers do so because of court decisions that have found localities can be held liable for wrongly detaining someone without probable cause to believe the person should be kept. In addition, he said, many communities have concluded that they don’t want their law-enforcement officials seen as agents of federal immigration law, for fear that crime victims and witnesses would not come forward. “By trying to force localities to honor these detainers, the federal government is putting localities between a rock and a hard place,” he said. In April, a federal judge in San Francisco ruled that Mr. Trump’s executive order threatening to pull funding from so-called sanctuary cities is likely unconstitutional.",0
1391,"WSJ","North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed a bill that would require sheriffs to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, the latest clash over an issue that has triggered fierce debate nationally. Under the measure, law-enforcement officers would be obligated to comply with requests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold illegal immigrants subject to deportation until agents can pick them up. Officials who fail to cooperate would be subject to removal from their positions. The state Senate approved the bill in June, followed by the House on Tuesday. Supporters of the measure said it was needed to protect the public, while opponents argued it would diminish safety by spreading fear among immigrants and discouraging them from cooperating with law enforcement. “This legislation is simply about scoring partisan political points and using fear to divide North Carolina,” Mr. Cooper, a Democrat, said in his veto message. “This bill, in addition to being unconstitutional, weakens law enforcement in North Carolina by mandating sheriffs to do the job of federal agents.” Republican legislative leaders assailed the governor’s decision and accused him of siding with illegal immigrants over the state’s citizens. “Today we found out North Carolina has a sanctuary governor,” said Republican state Rep. Destin Hall, primary sponsor of the measure. Sanctuary policies generally refer to those that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Ten states have laws prohibiting sanctuary jurisdictions, while 10 others and the District of Columbia have measures supporting them, according to the NCSL. In June, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law one of the strictest bans in the U.S. against sanctuary cities. The measure requires local law-enforcement agencies to cooperate with federal immigration authorities and honor requests to hold illegal immigrants. The issue has become politically charged in North Carolina. Last week, ICE arrested a Honduran migrant in Mecklenburg County, home to Charlotte, who had previously been arrested on rape and child-sex-offense charges. The agency said the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office refused to honor an ICE request two months earlier to hold the migrant, who it said was in the U.S. illegally, and released him. Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden responded that the migrant was released, as required by law, after fulfilling court-ordered conditions including paying a bond. Though the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association backed the bill vetoed by Mr. Cooper, some sheriffs, including Mecklenburg County’s, spoke out against it.",0
885,"Daily Caller","Voters support most of the provisions in a bill backed by President Donald Trump that would move the U.S. to a merit-based immigration system and slash legal immigration levels by nearly 50 percent over the next decade, according to a poll released Wednesday.
The RAISE Act, sponsored by Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, would dramatically curtail family-based migration in favor of giving priority to high-skilled immigrants. It would also end the diversity visa lottery program and cap annual refugee admissions at 50,000. Some of those provisions received support from more than half of voters surveyed by POLITICO/Morning Consult, while other aspects of the bill are backed by significant pluralities.
A majority of voters — 58 percent — agree with limiting the number of refugees offered permanent residency. A slightly higher share — 60 percent — favor establishing a “points system” that assigns value based on criteria such as education, English proficiency and prospective earnings in the U.S.
Other aspects of the bill enjoy less overall support, but those provisions still have more backers than opponents. Just under half — 48 percent — of voters support reducing the number of legal immigrants by half over the next decade, compared to 39 percent who oppose the cut. As for family-based chain migration, 45 percent want to block U.S. citizens and permanent residents from petitioning for green cards for extended family members, while 39 percent oppose ending the practice.
An English language proficiency requirement garners the most support — 62 percent of voters say it should be a factor in choosing who can legally immigrate to the U.S.
The RAISE Act generated instant controversy when it was formally introduced last week. At a White House press briefing, Trump administration senior adviser Stephen Miller sparred with several reporters who suggested that the bill was motivated by racial and ethnic animus. Miller and the bill’s Senate backers argue it will help poor and and low-skilled American workers by reducing the pool of immigrants competing with them for jobs.
As the POLITICO poll shows, voters appear to be more comfortable with the RAISE Act than Washington media reporting would suggest.
“Even the more controversial provisions in this legislation receive support from a plurality of voters,” said Morning Consult co-founder and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp. “The reason for this is ostensibly that Republican support is more consolidated than Democratic opposition. For example, 73 percent of Republican voters support reducing the number of legal immigrants, compared to 57 percent of Democrats who oppose that idea.”

255,"FoxNews","We’ve got a question for all these people claiming the crisis on the border is “fake.” Can’t you see the proof right before your own eyes?
President Trump laid the sad truth about the emergency on our unsecured southern border in his Oval Office address last week. Ever since the fake news media have been trying to convince us that everything is just fine.
MSOutletName’s Joe Scarborough called all of us “stupid” for believing there’s any crisis at all. Politico even tried to use a “fact-check” to tell us there’s no crisis. It’s obvious where they’re getting this nonsense from: Democrats, whose talking points they’re just disguising as “news” and “fact-checks.”
TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON BORDER WALL, AS POLLS SHOW VOTERS TURNING AGAINST HIS SHUTDOWN STRATEGY
The problem for them is that both Democrats and the media had no problem calling the border situation a “crisis” back when Barack Obama was president. In 2014, Obama himself used the term “crisis” to describe the wave of so-called unaccompanied minors. The same outlets that call us “stupid” for believing that the border is in crisis had no problem using the exact same term just five years ago. Even hyper-liberal Wikipedia still refers to the 2014 episode as an “American Immigration Crisis.”
Well, guess what? We’re back up to the same number of apprehensions that all these liberals agreed was a crisis back in 2014. In fact, the emergency is even worse now than it was back then.
Waves of children facing unimaginable dangers while trying to illegally cross the border on their own, like we saw in 2014, was bad enough. Now we keep facing organized “caravans” made up of thousands of migrants determined to breach our unsecured border and attack our Border Patrol agents.
Worse still, we have adults trying to take advantage of “catch and release” policies by using innocent children -- many of them unrelated minors kidnapped just for this purpose -- to take advantage of policies that give preferential treatment to illegal immigrants who travel as “families.”
You bet this is a crisis! It’s a crisis that’s been going on for years and years. It gets bigger and bigger, but only in the eyes of Democrats and the liberal media did it stop existing as a crisis once Donald Trump became president.
As President Trump pointed out in his Oval Office address, it’s Black Americans in particular who bear the brunt of this crisis. It’s those communities in particular that get flooded with the drugs and crime that surge across America’s unprotected southern border.
While rich people and big businesses reap the benefits of the influx of cheap labor from Mexico and Central America, it’s the African American community, black people, that pay the most for illegal immigration in the form of lost jobs and lower wages.
One study by economists from Harvard, the University of Chicago, and the University of California, San Diego found that immigration has had a more devastating effect on employment and wages for African-American men than the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 90s, resulting in thousands more black men going to prison instead of into the workforce.
We’d love to see a liberal journalist explain how crack wasn’t a “crisis” for Black America back then. That makes about as much sense as saying uncontrolled illegal immigration isn’t one.
All of these two-faced denials from the media serve just one purpose: to turn people against President Trump and undermine popular support for real border security.
You can bet Donald Trump takes the situation seriously enough that he’ll declare it a national emergency if Democrats keep refusing to acknowledge the reality of the crisis facing the American people. The Democrats and their media allies are convinced that if they just pretend there’s no crisis at all, they can stop the president from using his emergency authority, but they’re wrong.
You probably won’t hear it from the fake news media, but we’re actually living under 31 other national emergencies at this very moment, many of which were originally declared by Democratic presidents. Do liberals really expect us to believe that the violence, crime, drugs and economic suffering caused by rampant illegal immigration isn’t the 32nd crisis facing our country?
The American people aren’t blind, and when we look at the mess on our southern border, we see it for what it is: a crisis. You know Democrats think we’re too stupid to know all this. They think they can tell us everything is just fine on the border and we won’t educate ourselves on the truth. Well, they can’t play that game anymore.

2328,"USA Today","As a migrant caravan remained stalled Monday at the entrance of a border crossing, Vice President Mike Pence called the group seeking asylum in the United States a result of ""weak immigration laws and a porous border.""
""This caravan, like those who have gone before, is also rightly understood as a deliberate attempt to undermine the laws of this country and the sovereignty of the United States,"" Pence said during a visit to the El Centro border patrol station in California before touring construction of border fencing replacement project in Calexico.
Pence said migrants in the caravan were ""victims"" who he said were being ""exploited by open-border political activists and an agenda-driven media"" in addition to human smuggling organizations and criminal drug cartels who seize of their hardship and difficulty to undermine our laws and to profit for themselves.""
He called on Congress to close ""loopholes"" and to change ""lax immigration laws"" that he said emboldens migrants to make the dangerous journey to the U.S.
On Sunday about 200 migrants from Central America arrived at the San Ysidro port of entry seeking asylum, only to be turned away by U.S. border officers. They had traveled in a caravan 2,500 miles through Mexico over the past month.
For a second day on Monday, U.S. border officials said the port was at its capacity to process people arriving without entrance documents seeking asylum in the U.S.
The area outside the entrance to the port resembled a mini-refugee camp on Monday, with families huddled under blankets and tarps with temperatures in the 50s.
Streams of volunteers delivered food, diapers, and other necessities and to set up temporary tents and gazebos.
Others distributed toys to the dozens of young children traveling in the caravan, and a pair of clowns tried to inject a smidgen of fun into what was otherwise a dire situation.
With no access to public bathrooms, a young man stood on the sidewalk holding a cardboard box soliciting money to help migrants pay for the use of toilets in the neighboring shops and restaurants.
Irma Rivera, 31, said she spent a fitful night sleeping on the concrete floor with only a donated blanket as a mattress.
""It was really cold,"" Rivera said.
She said she had traveled with the caravan with her two children, Suany, 7, and Jesus, 4, after gangs in Honduras shot to death her husband, and threatened to kill her, she said.
She awoke Monday to find her Suany sick with diarrhea and vomiting. She spent most of the day escorting the children back and forth to a bathroom across the street.
As of Monday, none of the migrants from Central America seeking asylum in the U.S.have been allowed into the port to be processed, said Irineo Mujica of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the transnational group that organized the caravan.
CBP officials confirmed on Monday that the port remains at capacity and no new asylum seekers have been processed for the second day in a row.
""What I think they are trying to do is punish the caravan,” Mujica said. “We know that there is enormous pressure by the American government ... to punish the caravan to try and force them to leave and go back to their countries.”
The group Human Rights First called on the Trump administration to promptly process the asylum-seekers, calling the response so far ""a manufactured PR crisis designed to mislead the American public into closing the door on those seeking protection.""
""It is particularly alarming that the government has not yet processed a single person for protection, even though the caravan has complied with requests to break into smaller groups,” added Laura Gault, a Human Rights First lawyer observing the situation at the border. “The Trump Administration must stop trying to do an end-run around the law.""

Everard Meade, director of the trans border institute at the University of San Diego, said migrants without entrance documents have the legal right under U.S. law to present themselves at ports of entry to ask for asylum.
While it's unusual for such a large group of asylum-seekers to arrive at the port all at once, CBP officials have the capacity to detain them while their asylum claims are processed, either at a large detention nearby in Otay Mesa, or at other detention facilities.
""This is politics. There is nothing complicated about it,"" Meade said.""The president laid down a very public marker. He's been tweeting about it, and commenting about this, and he basically said that he is going to director Homeland Security not to let members of this caravan enter the United States.""
On Monday, Trump fired off another tweet, saying ""The migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are.""

Trump's antagonism toward the caravan is well-established.
At a Saturday night rally in Michigan, Trump called the situation a mess.

On Monday, with the forecast calling for rain and colder temperatures, migrants hunkered down for another night camped outside the entrance of the San Ysidro port in Tijuana.
Mujica said the migrants are prepared to wait as long as it takes until they are given a chance to present themselves to U.S. border officers and ask for asylum.
After traveling for more than a month over more than 2,500 miles through Mexico, it’s “unthinkable” that they will be returned to their home countries in Central America because they are fleeing for their lives, he said.
""It's been hell in their countries. It's been hell on their way to here. This is probably the best part. We are so close to the United States. We are so close to have the United States hear their cases and treat them fairly. We just hope it gets there,"" he said.
About 200 migrants from Central America who traveled with the caravan, including on buses and on freight trains, walked to the port on Sunday.
The event was covered by dozens of media outlets from Mexico, the U.S. and other countries.
One group of about 50 walked through the gates and into the port facilities but where turned away, Mujica said. On Monday, about 20 migrants from the initial group remained inside the port facility but as of Monday morning none of them had been processed, Mujica said.
The remainder are camped outside the entrance in an area that has been penned off by Mexican immigration officials. There are about a dozen Mexican federal police officers stationed outside to provide protection.

2262,"USA Today","Fearful they will be deported by the Trump administration, thousands of immigrants are illegally crossing from the U.S. into Canada in hopes of being granted asylum. (Aug. 9) AP
Abelardo Asensio Callol, 30, a software engineer from Cuba, fled to the United States and applied for asylum, but has been held in a prison for months as he awaits a ruling on his case. He is part of a group of asylum seekers suing the Department of Homeland Security over their prolonged detentions. Asylum seekers who have been held in U.S. detention centers since applying to enter the country filed a class-action lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday in the latest legal attack against President Trump's attempts to limit immigration.
The suit claims that Homeland Security has violated U.S. law by refusing to allow entire groups of asylum seekers to be released on parole from prisons and detention centers while their applications are decided.
The lawsuit, filed by a group of civil rights organizations in federal court in the District of Columbia on behalf of nine plaintiffs, estimates that more than 1,000 asylum seekers are now facing indefinite detention even though they have passed initial screenings to verify their story and pose no threat to national security.
""We came to the U.S. seeking freedom and what we got was a prison,"" Abelardo Asensio Callol, 30, a software engineer from Cuba, said by phone from the York County, Pa., Prison where he's been held for several months.
Asylum is an immigration status granted to people already in the U.S. who fear they will be persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality or political views if forced to return to their home country. The U.S. has approved an average of 23,668 asylum applications a year over the past decade.
People who present themselves at U.S. borders are allowed to claim asylum. A Homeland Security agent interviews that person and if they determine the applicant has a ""credible fear"" of returning home, they are allowed to make their case before an immigration judge. In 2009, the Obama administration instituted a policy that made it easier for asylum applicants to be released on parole while their cases are being decided.
The Trump administration has used a variety of measures to limit legal and illegal immigration, from its controversial travel ban targeting majority-Muslim countries to its attempts to limit refugee admissions to the U.S. The asylum program has not been spared.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has railed against the asylum system because he claims it is fraught with abuse by immigrants coached on what they have to say and ""dirty immigration lawyers"" who have exploited loopholes in the system. During an October speech, Sessions claimed more than half of asylum applicants released on parole never show up for their court hearings, proving that ""their claim of fear was simply a ruse to enter the country illegally.""
""The system is being gamed,"" Sessions said.
Immigration advocates dispute those numbers and say the only ones gaming the system are Homeland Security officials who have started treating asylum seekers as criminals.
Hardy Vieux, legal director for Human Rights First and one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, said every presidential administration has the authority to implement its own policies. But he said the Constitution and the 72-year-old Administrative Procedure Act require that new regulations be implemented through a formal process to ensure they are legal and constitutional.
Vieux said the Trump administration has violated those tenets by keeping the 2009 Obama-era memo in place, yet eliminating the possibility of parole for asylum seekers being held in the Detroit, El Paso, Los Angeles, Newark and Philadelphia regions. The lawsuit alleges that from 2010 to 2013, Homeland Security granted parole to asylum seekers in those districts 89% of the time. Since Trump took office, the suit alleges that number has plummeted to 4%.
""Its not about being formalistic, its about engendering fairness. It's about weaving a narrative so that the American public and others look at America and say, 'These people adhere to a system that is undergirded by the rule of law,'"" Vieux said. Trump administration officials, ""often disregard the law and disregard our values which are mainstays of the republic.""
Courts have repeatedly ruled against the administration over the way its tried to implement broad immigration policy changes. In January, a federal judge in California ordered Homeland Security to restart the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program because it used flawed legal reasoning to end it. That program, which has protected nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children from deportation, remains active as it winds its way through the courts.
The detention of asylum-seekers gained national attention last month after the American Civil Liberties Union sued the administration for separating a Congolese woman from her 7-year-old daughter when they tried to apply for asylum. The mother was detained in San Diego while her daughter was held in a detention facility in Chicago for four months.
Days after that lawsuit was filed, the mother was released. But she has not yet been reunited with her daughter, according to the ACLU, which is also a party in Thursday's class-action lawsuit.
That challenge is intended to help hundreds of other asylum seekers. The named plaintiffs include an ethics teacher from Haiti who was attacked after teaching his class about government corruption, a Venezuelan who was threatened for participating in marches opposing the country's communist government, and a gay Honduran man who was threatened at gunpoint. One has been held in detention centers for 21 months, another for 17 months.
Callol, the Cuban software engineer, fled his home because he says he was threatened by government officials for not participating in a public funeral for Fidel Castro. Callol said his superiors at work always chastised him for not attending marches and demonstrations to support the communist regime, and skipping Castro's funeral was apparently the last straw.
Callol said he lost his job, and security agents visited his home to threaten his wife and two-year-old daughter. But after making a long trek through South America to reach the U.S.-Mexico border, he said he received a harsh welcome in Texas. Callol said he was shuffled from prison to prison, often chained at the hands, ankles and waist, before donning an orange jumpsuit for his extended stay in the York County Prison.
He said he meets all the conditions required for getting parole while his case is judged: he has no criminal history, he verified his identity, showed he has sponsors in the U.S., and has letters supporting his backstory. But still, he and hundreds of others wait behind bars.
""We don't understand. We're trying to comply with all of their requirements,"" Callol said. ""But they keep denying us. We're here with regular prisoners. And we have no idea how long we're going to be here.""",0
635,"Daily Caller","The high-stakes legal struggle over President Donald Trump’s executive order on refugees and migrants has reached the Supreme Court.
The Department of Justice filed an emergency petition at the Supreme Court late Thursday, asking the justices to allow enforcement of the president’s executive order and overturn a lower court ruling barring the directive’s imposition.
In a 10-3 ruling last week, the full 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that President Trump’s order is objectively lawful. The panel nonetheless concluded it was unconstitutional in this instance, because Trump’s stated national security interest in issuing the order was little more than a pretext for discriminating against Muslims.
“That remarkable holding is wrong and in manifest need of this Court’s review,” the Department wrote in its petition. The 4th Circuit’s ruling leaves the provision of the order barring migration from six countries with high instances of terrorism under injunction.
DOJ asked the justices to set aside the ruling and schedule the case for oral arguments. They also requested that the Court lift an injunction issued by a federal judge in Hawaii which bars enforcement of key provisions of the order.
The Justice Department issued a statement shortly after the petitions were filed.
“We have asked the Supreme Court to hear this important case and are confident that President Trump’s executive order is well within his lawful authority to keep the nation safe and protect our communities from terrorism,” said spokeswomen Sarah Isgur Flores. “The president is not required to admit people from countries that sponsor or shelter terrorism.”
Four justices must agree to take the case in order to initiate Supreme Court review, though five votes are necessary to overturn lower court orders barring enforcement of Trump’s directive. Therefore, the Court may take the case while allowing injunctions enjoining the order to stand. The justices will likely issue a decision regarding the stay requests in short order, though a decision as to whether to review the case will take longer.
Timing could quickly become a hindrance for the Department. The Supreme Court sits from early October to the end of June, and is no longer scheduling cases for arguments during this term. Therefore, should the justices agree to take the case, it may not be heard until late this year. This long timeframe is especially detrimental to the government’s case, as it could undermine the administration’s argument that the order was motivated by urgent threats to national security.
Still, the government argues the courts must defer to the president’s national security findings, and blasted the 4th Circuit for imputing discriminatory intent on the basis of the president’s campaign statements. In its ruling last week, the court found that the president’s campaign season rhetoric evinces an intent to discriminate against Muslims.
“This Court has never invalidated religion-neutral government action based on speculation about officials’ subjective motivations drawn from campaign-trail statements by a political candidate,” the Department wrote.
In closing, the Department repeated an admonition offered by acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall at the conclusion of his arguments before the 4th Circuit. Wall gently reminded the court that the intense controversies the case occasions should not obscure the fundamental issue at hand — the scope of the president’s immigration and national security powers. The Department writes:
“[T]he precedent set by this case for the judiciary’s proper role in reviewing the President’s national-security and immigration authority will transcend this debate, this Order, and this constitutional moment. Precisely in cases that spark such intense feelings, it is all the more critical to adhere to foundational legal rules. The decision below departs from those rules, and calls into question the Executive and his authority in a way that warrants this Court’s review.”
A ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on the president’s second order is still pending as of this writing. It is not clear what the 9th Circuit will do should the justices issue a decision on DOJ’s petition before they issue their own ruling.",1
2371,"USA Today","White House adviser Stephen Miller, considered one of the chief architects of President Donald Trump's immigration policies, pushed back at the idea the president's decision to declare a national emergency over border wall funding was unconstitutional in a heated interview Sunday.
Trump declared the emergency on Friday after signing a funding bill that included less than a quarter of the money he had requested for the construction of a border barrier, which he says is necessary to stop illegal immigration.
During an interview on ""OutletName Sunday,"" host Chris Wallace pressed Miller on the need for a national emergency, citing U.S. Customs and Border Patrol data showing between 80 to 90 percent of drugs seized in attempted smugglings happened at ports of entry.
Miller defended the decision, saying the U.S. can't have ""uncontrolled, unsecured"" areas of the border.
""Congress in 1976 passed the National Emergency Act and gave the president the authority, as a result of that, to invoke a national emergency in many different circumstances, but among them the use of military construction funds,"" Miller said.
Wallace pressed Miller to cite another example from the 59 times presidents used the National Emergency Act where it was invoked to obtain money that Congress had refused to appropriate. Miller did not cite such a precedent and took issue with the premise of the question.
""They didn’t refuse to appropriate it,"" Miller said. ""They passed a law specifically saying the president could have this authority. It’s in the plain statute. That’s the decision that Congress made, and if people don’t like that, they can address it.""
Critics who say the president is using his emergency powers to skirt Congress' constitutional authority over spending have pointed to his own word when he announced he would declare the emergency.
""I didn’t need to do this. But I’d rather do it much faster,"" Trump said at one point during the lengthy news conference on the White House lawn Friday.
'Dangerous precedent': U.S. Chamber joins conservative critics of Trump's emergency declaration
California's Democratic Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Sunday that he will ""definitely and imminently"" file a lawsuit against the Trump administration to contest the declaration, claiming conditions at the border do not constitute an emergency.
""It’s clear that this isn’t an emergency – it’s clear that in the mind of Donald Trump he needs to do something to try to fulfill a campaign promise,"" Becerra said in an interview on OutletName's ""This Week."" The construction of a border wall has been a central issue for Trump since he first announced he was running for president in 2015.

Opponents of Trump's wall point to government statistics that the number of migrants crossing the border annually has declined in recent years. Many of the migrants who are making the journey are asylum seekers who seek out immigration officials when they arrive at the border.
They also point to government data that show that immigrants commit crimes at a lower frequency than U.S. citizens and that a wall is unnecessary because most of the drugs and people enter the U.S. at established points of entry. On Friday, Trump said he did not find that data credible.",0
136,"FoxNews","Since getting back from Christmas break, I've tortured myself by reading and watching some of the usual suspects in the media - Fake news populated by fake thinkers.
Now there are basically two movements in the coverage. First, the manufactured outrage about what is a partial, and obviously temporary, government shutdown. Government workers haven't missed a paycheck yet. I hope they don't.
The second in this coverage is the downplayed concern about the actual effect that illegal immigration has in America, because in the media's way of thinking, it's not a crisis at all.
OK. I am completely confused. It's a crisis that certain nonessential government workers won't be paid starting on Friday - though they will ultimately get all their money when the government reopens. But it's not a crisis when just in the past fiscal year, a total of almost 400,000 individuals were caught crossing our southwest border?
Now, to give you a sense of just how bad it is, in October and November of this past year, that's the first two months of the new fiscal year, almost 102,000 people have been caught. That's quite a clip.
And the number of people crossing illegally with children has also skyrocketed. In the Rio Grande Valley sector alone, the number spiked 27 percent since last year, jumping from like 49,896 in fiscal year 2017 to 63,278 in the last fiscal year. Not a crisis?
This is, and has been, a crisis felt by average Americans far beyond the comfy confines of TV studios and far beyond the heady halls of Congress. Yet the media and deceitful politicians only acknowledge the crisis when the tragedy of an immigrant child makes the headlines.
And you bet every life is precious. And you bet that every death is tragic - deaths at the border, deaths beyond the border. But the fault here lies with irresponsible parents who expose their children to this perilous journey and the feckless politicians who refused to do their job and support a common sense enforcement agenda that President Trump has and asylum reform that is beyond desperately needed.
Now, over the past year, I have repeatedly urged the president to address this critical issue, and not just the wall, in a major primetime address. Well, I'm glad to see that he announced he's doing just that on Tuesday night. And it's going to be followed by a trip to the actual border in McAllen, Texas. Good.
I would hope that when he does this, the president personalizes the border crisis. Those statistics I just gave you are important. But we need to emphasize how illegal immigration has directly - and at times, tragically - affected the lives of all Americans and the people trying to come into the country. It's been dangerous for them.
Tuesday's speech should be wide-ranging, hitting all the big immigration issues, from chain migration to the visa lottery, the need for mandatory e-verify in the workplace, and also yes, even the scam of so-called birthright citizenship. That's where children of non-U.S. citizens are granted automatic citizenship, just for being born here.
Every year, thousands of Chinese, Russians, and others travel to the United States to have babies just for the U.S. passport. It's called birth tourism. It is a complete outrage. It's big business. And no, it's not a constitutional right. So don't try me on that.
As for all those who claim, by the way, that illegal immigration is not a crisis, I think American families of these victims would disagree. The day after Christmas, California officer Ronil Singh was shot in cold blood during a routine traffic stop. He left behind a wife and a five-month-old baby. His murderer is illegal alien Gustavo Perez Arriaga.
Thousands of citizens and hundreds of officers attended the funeral service over the weekend. I wish all of you could watch it.Officer Singh originally hailed from Fiji. Naivakarurubalavu Solo Mara, the Fijian ambassador to the U.S., spoke at the service and he had a better grasp of this tragedy than many American commentators.
""No words can take away their pains. No object can fill the void in their hearts,"" he said. ""No embrace can be more comforting. No scheme can replace their shattered dreams. No death can be more untimely. This is what Ronil Singh's passing must mean to those closest to him.""
And Officer Singh's parents are still alive as well, by the way.
And then on December 29th, 22-year-old Pierce Corcoran was killed in a collision in Knoxville, Tenn. The man who swerved into him and took his life was another illegal alien, Franco Cambrany Francisco-Eduardo.
My friends, the families of both of these upstanding Americans are in crisis. The president cannot relent. He must continue to speak for these families and frankly for the millions of you who believe that every country -- not just our country but every country around the world -- has the sovereign right to determine who can and cannot reside here. It's not immoral to do so.
And if our elected representatives refuse to do their solemn duty to defend our country, then we, in essence, kind of already have a government that is shut down -- shut down to the will of the people. And by the way, the people routinely rank illegal immigration as one of the most urgent problems facing this nation.
As for the Republicans on Capitol Hill, think about it for a moment. Take a lesson from the Democrats. They never break ranks. Think about what you Republicans accomplished by supporting the president during the confirmation fight of Brett Kavanaugh. When things got tough, when the media were piling on, Republicans stood firm. Do it again here.
The Democrats are desperate to divide and conquer the GOP. Don't let them.

2436,"Reuters","After talking on the phone with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday morning, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin was optimistic that a compromise deal with some Republicans to protect young “Dreamer” immigrants was on the verge of success. Less than three hours later, Durbin and a Republican colleague, Senator Lindsey Graham, drove away from the White House with the deal in pieces and a controversy over offensive language about to reverberate worldwide. At their Oval Office meeting, two sources said, Trump questioned the value of taking immigrants from Haiti and African nations, and referred to them as “shithole countries.” The remarks leaked out, transforming a debate about saving from deportation some 700,000 young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children into another drama about Trump himself. His comments drew a chorus of condemnation inside the United States and internationally, especially in Africa. Nearly a year into Trump’s presidency, members of Congress are still struggling to relate to the unorthodox Trump and his spontaneous, often crude remarks. In a tweet on Friday, Trump denied using the word “shithole,” but Durbin insisted that the president had indeed said it. SHIFT IN TONE
The tone of discussion had looked very different early on Thursday. Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, called the White House to tell Trump that a bipartisan group of senators had struck a deal to put Dreamers on a path to citizenship, beef up border security and take other steps to change immigration laws. Around 10:15 a.m., Trump returned Durbin’s call and was told about the main elements of the deal. Ben Marter, a spokesman for Durbin, did not provide details of the conversation but said the senator was “encouraged” by Trump’s reaction. Trump said Durbin and Graham - two seasoned lawmakers - should come to the White House for a meeting at noon. Durbin thought it would just be the senators and Trump in the room. Instead, Trump had also invited some of Congress’ hard-line opponents of the bipartisan agreement being put together by the six-member working group led by Durbin and Graham. Republican Senator Tom Cotton and Republican Representative Bob Goodlatte were both there, as was White House aide Stephen Miller, a proponent of severely limiting immigration. Graham and Durbin laid out the details of their proposed legislation. But instead of winning Trump’s support, as they had expected, the president launched into a broadside against immigration from Haiti and Africa. At one point, Trump, according to two sources, said: “Why do we want all these people from Africa here? They’re shithole countries. ... We should have more people from Norway.” Durbin said Graham immediately spoke up against Trump’s comments, and he commended the Republican senator for doing so. Commenting on the White House meeting, Graham said on Friday that diversity had always been the United States’ strength. “Following comments by the President, I said my piece directly to him yesterday. The President and all those attending the meeting know what I said and how I feel,” Graham said in a statement. Once it was clear by mid-afternoon on Thursday that Trump was not going to support the bipartisan deal, the group led by Durbin and Graham issued a terse statement. “We have been working for four months and have reached an agreement in principle” that addresses the main policies Trump sought, they said. “We are now working to build support for that deal in Congress.” There was no mention at that time of the language that sources said Trump had used, details of which were soon leaked.",0
2422,"Reuters","U.S. immigration authorities signed deals on Monday with 18 of Texas’ 254 counties to expand a program that allows jailers at local sheriffs’ offices to cooperate with federal authorities in immigration enforcement. The deal signed at a sheriffs’ meeting in suburban Dallas comes as both the administration of U.S. Republican President Donald Trump, and Texas, the most populous Republican-controlled state, seek to crack down on “sanctuary cities,” places that shield immigrants who are in the country illegally. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reached what is known as a 287(g) agreement with the counties. The deal trains local agents in the sheriff’s offices to check if the people they have in custody may be in violation of U.S. immigration law. The program has been on the books since 1996 and allows the Department of Homeland Security to enter into formal written agreements with state and local police departments for officers to perform some of the functions of federal immigration enforcement officials. “There’s no doubt that arresting removable aliens in a jail is safer for the officers, safer for the community and even safer for the alien himself,” Acting ICE Director Tom Homan told a news conference. A.J. Louderback, sheriff of Jackson County, told the news conference that his county southwest of Houston joined the program to control criminality. The sheriff of Harris County, the most populous county in the state and home to Houston, dropped out of the program earlier this year, saying it cost his office too much in terms of manpower and money. Many of the 18 counties, which have a total population of about 1.5 million, are near Harris County. Texas has a population of about 28 million. The new agreement in Texas is for jails, but a task force model of the program has been used to allow police on patrol to check on people’s immigration status. Civil rights groups contend the method promotes illegal racial profiling. Former President Barack Obama’s administration wound down the task force model and only six new agreements were added between 2012 and 2016, according ICE, part of Homeland Security. With the addition of the 18 programs in Texas, ICE now has 60 active 287(g) agreements, nearly double the number of programs that were active in 2016. The mandate to expand the program was outlined in an executive order on immigration enforcement signed just days after Trump took office in January.",0
422,"Breitbart","Sen. Tom Cotton’s (R-AR) strong influence over the national debate on immigration policy and President Trump’s administration has left Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) unwilling to broker an immigration deal unless the populist conservative Senator is left out of the conversation.
A POLITICO report revealed the level to which Cotton and his close ally Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) — both staunch pro-American immigration reformers who want to see legal immigration levels reduced to benefit American workers — have gotten under the skin of Schumer and Democrats.
When it comes to striking a deal between the Republican establishment, the “America First” wing of the Republican Party, Democrats, and the Trump administration on the issue of nearly 800,000 illegal aliens who have been shielded from deportation by the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Schumer allegedly told the president that he will not negotiate a deal if Cotton is involved.
The report stated:
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told President Trump this week that there will be no deal on Dreamers if hard-line conservative GOP Sen. Tom Cotton is involved, according to several congressional sources. Schumer also told the president that he was not being well served by White House staffers during negotiations over the fate of 700,000 young immigrants who face potential deportation if no deal is reached to protect them.
Schumer and Democrats, according to POLITICO, are greatly annoyed that Cotton and Perdue corrected the record on a White House meeting last week in which Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and others claimed Trump called African nations and El Salvador “shithole” countries.
“In regards to Senator Durbin’s accusation, we do not recall the President saying these comments specifically but what he did call out was the imbalance in our current immigration system, which does not protect American workers and our national interest,” Cotton and Perdue said in a statement.
Schumer and his open borders allies are also bugged by the fact that Cotton and Perdue — who introduced the Trump-endorsed, legal immigration-cutting RAISE Act last year — have been devoted to Trump’s popular pro-American immigration agenda.
Tom Cotton: ‘Not Nativist’ to Want Immigration Policy ‘Crafted to Benefit American Citizens, Not Foreigners’://t.co/mlY8XtSU4s — John Binder 👽 () December 26, 2017
That economic nationalist agenda includes an end to the process known as “chain migration” – whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. – as well as an end to the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which randomly gives out 50,000 visas every year to foreign nationals who win a lottery to permanently resettle in the U.S.
Unlike members of the Republican establishment, such as Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Cotton and Perdue have not caved in negotiations with Democrats on an immigration deal.
When an expansive amnesty plan by the “Gang of Six” — which includes Flake, Graham, Durbin, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO), Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) — was revealed this week, Cotton, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen shut the proposal down, blasting it for not including an end to chain migration, the Visa Lottery, and full funding for a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Might as well roll it straight into the trash can … mass amnesty far beyond DACA, fake border security, no end to chain migration. ://t.co/pkpCrJxXfa — Tom Cotton () January 17, 2018
Nothing in return: phantom border security, chain migration visas merely shifted temporarily among categories of relatives, & diversity lottery visas permanently locked in. And don't forget amnesty for 400k TPS recipients! ://t.co/k9vJ8gg5Wo — Tom Cotton () January 17, 2018
Cotton, seen as the heir to Sessions’ pro-American immigration agenda in the Senate, told POLITICO in an interview that the likely reason Schumer did not want him to be part of White House negotiations on immigration was “probably because I would get a good deal, and he wants a bad deal.”
Trump, Cotton, and Perdue have been successful in getting some members of the Republican establishment, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Graham, to oppose chain migration, which has imported more than nine million foreign nationals to the U.S. in the last decade, a figure that exceeds two years of American births and the population of New York City.
In an explosive report, OutletName News revealed that chain migration, if not ended, is expected to add between seven and eight million new foreign-born voters to the U.S. electorate – a scheme that favors Democrats as immigrants, specifically Hispanics and Asians, who vote 2-to-1 for Democrats over Republicans.
Nonetheless, chain migration and the Visa Lottery are overwhelmingly unpopular with the American people.
Poll: 60 Percent of Likely Voters Want to End ‘Visa Lottery’ Responsible for Importing NYC Terror Suspect ://t.co/Qk0pj5NxDZ — John Binder 👽 () January 4, 2018
In a new poll by Pulse Opinion Research, nearly 60 percent of likely voters want to see chain migration ended, while 60 percent also want to see the Visa Lottery program ended. That same poll showed that 60 percent of likely voters said legal immigration levels should be reduced to 500,000 admissions a year or even less – a plan that Trump, Cotton, and Perdue have championed.
Every year, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 43.7 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population. Mass immigration to the U.S. has kept American wages stagnant, while depressing job prospects for poor, working, and middle class communities.",1
1495,"WSJ","Women fleeing domestic violence overseas could lose the right to claim asylum in the U.S. under a review of immigration-court precedent launched by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week, people familiar with the case said. The move is one of several Mr. Sessions has made in recent weeks under his power to intervene in specific cases normally heard by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Earlier last week, Mr. Sessions threw out a 2014 board decision that afforded full hearings to most asylum applicants even if an immigration judge had found their claims didn’t set out a basis for granting asylum. That followed Mr. Sessions’s January order directing to himself a case that could abolish the power of immigration judges to freeze proceedings through “administrative closure,” effectively allowing certain aliens to remain in the U.S. indefinitely unless their cases are reopened. While Mr. Sessions’s actions regarding asylum law may later face federal court scrutiny, the attorney general is head of the immigration-court system, which is an arm of the Justice Department rather than an independent branch of government. The moves reflect the Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to tighten immigration enforcement it believes grew too lax in previous years. Last week, Mr. Sessions filed suit against the state of California, which had enacted measures limiting cooperation with federal immigration officials. In a one-page order dated March 7, the attorney general personally took charge of a case titled Matter of A-B- that previously had been set for review by the appeals board. The issue, according to Mr. Sessions’s order, involves whether victims of “private criminal activity” are members of a “particular social group” whose persecution qualifies for protection under asylum law. “The A.G. is requesting amicus briefs from all interested parties and considering this matter because of a lack of clarity in the court system,” a Justice Department official said. Mr. Sessions’s order, which set a briefing schedule for April, provided no further details regarding the case or the applicant, identified only by the initials A.B. A lawyer for A.B., Ben Winograd of the Immigrant & Refugee Appellate Center LLC, Alexandria, Va., said his client is a domestic violence victim from El Salvador. The case’s “underlying issue is domestic violence,” said Geoffrey Hoffman, director of the University of Houston Law Center’s immigration clinic. Mr. Hoffman said he had read the case under review but wasn’t free to provide details about its particular facts. He said, however, that the Board of Immigration Appeals has reckoned with domestic-violence claims several times, and in 2014 issued a landmark decision affording victims eligibility for asylum. That case, Matter of A-R-C-G-, held that “married women in Guatemala who are unable to leave their relationship” qualified as a “particular social group” facing persecution. Immigrant advocacy groups celebrated the A-R-C-G- ruling as reflecting real-world conditions that drive women from their homelands. Critics, however, complained that it expanded asylum into a broad remedy for social ills, beyond its traditional role as refuge for those fleeing ethnic, political or religious persecution by those in power. Mr. Sessions’s action could set the stage for narrowing or even overturning the A-R-C-G- precedent, and could have implications for other nontraditional asylum claims, such as flight from gang violence. ​ As of the end of December 2017, there were more than 667,000 cases pending in the immigration courts, including more than 294,000 that made asylum claims. Andrew R. Arthur, a former immigration judge and fellow at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, said Mr. Sessions’s moves were a welcome correction to the Obama years. “President Trump plainly has a specific view when it comes to immigration, and Attorney General Sessions, through his review authority, is going try to implement that view,” he said. “They want to streamline the system so those that merit relief are able to get their [asylum] applications in an expedited manner, while those who are not eligible either don’t apply or get a quick decision.” Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s senior Democrat, wasn’t so complimentary. “People seeking asylum in this country are among the world’s most vulnerable—those who have been tortured, children who arrive in the country alone and without family and individuals fleeing horrific crime and persecution,” she said. “What’s absolutely clear about the attorney general’s decision is that this administration will leave no stone unturned to further its attacks on immigrants and undermine their rights.”",0
2426,"Reuters","New York and Washington state on Monday vowed to sue President Donald Trump if he scraps a program shielding from deportation immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children. The Trump administration is expected to announce on Tuesday that he will end the so-called Dreamers program but give the U.S. Congress six months to craft legislation to replace it, according to sources familiar with the situation. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will announce plans for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program at 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) on Tuesday, but will not take questions, the Justice Department said on Monday. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, in a joint statement with the state’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said, “The president’s action would upend the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people who have only ever called America their home.” The attorney general of Washington state, Bob Ferguson, also threatened legal action. “I will use all the legal tools at my disposal to defend the thousands of Dreamers in Washington state,” he said in a statement. Ferguson and Schneiderman were among 20 attorneys general who wrote to Trump in July to say that if he ended the program, they would defend it “by all appropriate means.” Nine Republican state attorneys general have said they would file suit on Tuesday if Trump did not end the program. The White House declined to comment on Monday. DACA is a policy created by former President Barack Obama that protects nearly 800,000 young people, often called “Dreamers,” from deportation and allows them to work legally. Under the shift Trump is considering, any Dreamer with a valid work permit would be able to remain in the United States until the permit expires, in the absence of congressional action, sources familiar with the matter said. At the same time, the Department of Homeland Security would not target Dreamers for deportation, one of the sources said. Dreamers are a fraction of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, most of them Hispanic. Trump as a candidate promised to deport all of them, but many Americans have rallied to support the young adults, who have spent large parts of their lives in the United States. While Republicans in Congress have generally taken a hard line on illegal immigration and are sympathetic to the argument that Obama overstepped his bounds in creating DACA, several have stepped forward to call for action to protect the Dreamers. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, the top elected Republican official, on Friday urged Trump not to rescind the program, as did Senator Orrin Hatch. Senator James Lankford said on Monday it was not appropriate to “hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents.” Another Republican, Senator Tom Cotton, who has been particularly outspoken on reforming immigration laws, told the Washington Examiner he supports legislation that would protect dreamers and take legal steps to reduce illegal immigration. Many prominent business leaders, including the chief executive officers of Microsoft MSFT.O, General Motors GM.N and Facebook Inc FB.O -- Satya Nadella, Mary Barra and Mark Zuckerberg, respectively -- have also urged Trump not to reverse the Dreamer program.",0
2315,"USA Today","Three Kansas militia members were convicted Wednesday of plotting to bomb a mosque and apartment complex housing Somali refugees, an attack thwarted by another member of the group who tipped off federal authorities about escalating threats of violence.
Patrick Stein, Gavin Wright and Curtis Allen were convicted of one count of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and one count of conspiracy against civil rights. Wright was convicted of a charge of lying to the FBI. Sentencing is set for June 27.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the verdicts a significant victory against domestic terrorism and hate crimes.
“The defendants in this case acted with clear premeditation in an attempt to kill people on the basis of their religion and national origin,” Sessions said in a news release. “That’s not just illegal — it’s immoral and unacceptable, and we’re not going to stand for it.”
Defense attorneys declined to comment following the verdict.
The three men were indicted in October 2016 for plotting an attack for the day after the presidential election in the meatpacking town of Garden City, about 220 miles (350 kilometers) west of Wichita.
U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister told reporters that the jury’s verdicts represent “a victory for the rule of law and national security.”
Prosecutors have said that a fellow militia member, Dan Day, became alarmed by some of his colleagues’ threats and agreed to wear a wire as a paid informant. The government’s case featured months of profanity-laced recordings in which militia members discussed plans and referred to the Somalis as “cockroaches.”
“That confidential source is also to be commended for doing the right thing and the courage he demonstrated,” McAllister said.
Wright is captured in one recording saying he hoped an attack on the Somalis would “wake people up” and inspire others to take similar action against Muslims.
“We welcome the guilty verdicts in this disturbing case and hope that anyone considering turning bigoted views into violent actions will see what their fate will be when apprehended and prosecuted by law enforcement authorities,” said Moussa Elbayoumy, chairman of the Kansas chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
The government argued that the men formed a splinter group of the militia Kansas Security Force that came to be known as “the Crusaders.” The testimony and recordings indicate the men tried to recruit other members of the Kansas Security Force to join them.
According to prosecutors, Stein was recorded discussing the type of fuel and fertilizer bomb that Timothy McVeigh used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed 168 people. Stein was arrested when he delivered 300 pounds (135 kilograms) of fertilizer to undercover FBI agents to make explosives.
Attorneys for the defense said the FBI set up the men with a paid informant and all the talk about violence wasn’t serious. They said the men had a right to free speech and association under the U.S. Constitution.
Prosecutors argued that the plot was more than just words.
The men discussed obtaining vehicles and filling them with explosives and parking them at the four corners of the apartment complex to create an explosion that would bring down and level the entire complex, McAllister said. They downloaded recipes from the internet and they experimented with and tested those explosives.",0
2679,"Reuters","President Donald Trump will push Republican lawmakers on Thursday for swift action on his agenda including funding a U.S.-Mexican border wall, rewriting the tax code and repealing the Obamacare law, despite tensions over timetables and priorities.
Congressional Republicans are in Philadelphia for a three-day retreat to hammer out a legislative agenda, with the party in control of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives for the first time in a decade.
But Republican lawmakers have found themselves answering questions from reporters not just about their legislative agenda but also about Trump statements on matters such as alleged voting irregularities and CIA interrogation tactics.
House of Representatives Speaker Ryan took issue with the notion that congressional Republicans are not in synch with Trump, the New York businessman who was sworn in last Friday having never previously held public office.
""We are on the same page with the White House,"" Ryan said during a joint news conference with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
""This is going to be an unconventional presidency,"" Ryan added. ""I think you know this by now. ... I think we're going to see unconventional activities like tweets and things like that. I think that's just something that we're all going to have to get used to.""
For weeks, Republicans talked about formulating an agenda for the first 100 days of Trump's presidency. In recent days, the talk has turned into a 200-day agenda for passing major legislation before the lawmakers' August recess.
Ryan said congressional Republicans have been working with the Trump administration on a daily basis ""to map out and plan a very bold and aggressive agenda to make good on our campaign promises"" including repealing and replacing Democratic former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, as well as tax code and regulatory changes.
In comments suggesting a lack of confidence in finishing the job quickly, Ryan said on Thursday that it is a ""goal"" to take major steps by year's end, without guaranteeing that a replacement for Obamacare and a tax reform bill would be enacted by the end of December.
In his first address to House and Senate Republicans since taking office, Trump is expected to try to rally party lawmakers to take quick action on his priorities. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said the pace of legislative action may frustrate Trump.
""President Trump comes from a different world,"" McCarthy told reporters. ""Out in the business community, he likes things done fast, and he's going to continue to push them.""
SPENDING ISSUES
McConnell said lawmakers will take up legislation to provide $12 billion to $15 billion to pay for Trump's planned wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday for the wall to proceed, part of a package of measures aimed at curbing illegal immigration, although the action has tested already frayed relations with Mexico.
McConnell and Ryan did not say whether Congress would offset the cost of the wall by cutting other programs or simply add to already huge budget deficits that they have criticized for years.
""We anticipate a supplemental (budget) coming from the administration,"" Ryan said at a news conference. ""The point is we're going to finance the Secure Fence Act.""
Asked whether the Republicans could promise not to run up the federal deficit with everything on their agenda this year including the wall, infrastructure spending and tax cuts, Ryan said, ""We are fiscal conservatives. What that means is we believe government should not live beyond its means.""
Trump and his allies in Congress are certain to face Democratic opposition to many of his legislative priorities, and Senate rules allow the minority party to mount procedural hurdles that could slow or impede passage.
Some Republican lawmakers expressed hope that Trump will give them a clear idea about what he wants on issues such as the border tax that he has threatened to impose on U.S. companies that move jobs overseas.
""The president speaks in broad terms. This gives us an opportunity to talk back and forth,"" Representative Mike Kelly, who sits on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said of Thursday's meeting with Trump.
""All of us are taking a look at what is it that we can do so that what we send to the White House makes sense to the majority of us.""

143,"FoxNews","President Donald Trump’s proposed border security measures are undermining bipartisan negotiations on Capitol Hill -- and could potentially lead to a government shutdown, a top Senate Democrat said Friday.
U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the second-ranking Senate Democrat, called Trump’s plans -- including $18 billion for a border wall -- at the expense of months of bipartisan efforts, “outrageous.”
Republicans countered that the Democrats' proposals for immigration were just as “ridiculous.”
As U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., tweeted Friday, “The only thing that’s not serious is the Gang of Amnesty’s ridiculous proposal: amnesty in the millions, no end to chain migration, use diversity-lottery green cards for TPS aliens (T = temporary!), & pittance for phony border security. Get real!”
The Trump administration's planned ""border wall system"" would ultimately include 864 miles of a “new main wall and 1,163 of a replacement or secondary barrier,” Politico reported, citing information in a five-page document it obtained.
The document also addressed enforcement provisions, which would require detention facilities and holding centers for families and unaccompanied minors caught at the border.
The Department of Homeland Security would be allowed to raise visa and border crossing fees as a way to compensate offshoot the cost of these investments.
All of proposals, however, would need to be funded by Congress.",1
1217,"WSJ","International immigration is giving a boost to population growth in big urban areas in the U.S. even as local residents flee for places with lower housing costs, new research suggests. The top beneficiaries of international immigration were primarily major coastal cities, led by the Miami metropolitan area, where immigration accounted for 1.1% of year-over-year population growth in 2016, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data released Thursday by Jed Kolko, chief economist at job-search firm Indeed and a senior fellow at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley. “The places that get the most international migrants are expensive—big coastal cities—whereas affordability is a bigger driver of domestic migration,” Mr. Kolko said. Mr. Kolko’s analysis shows the areas that stand to lose the most if immigration decreases. Miami was followed closely by the San Jose metro area, where the population grew by 0.9% due to immigration. Orlando, the New York City area, Washington, D.C., and Boston also enjoyed immigration-fueled growth. At the same time, all of these big cities except for Orlando lost more people to domestic migration than they gained. The Cape Coral-Fort Myers area in Florida got the biggest boost from domestic migration, with a 2.5% bump in 2016 from people moving there from elsewhere in the U.S. All of the top five beneficiaries of domestic migration were in Florida. Population growth is closely tied to the health of the local housing market, according to an analysis of the same Census data by Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at real estate website Trulia. In metro areas across the U.S., population growth had a nearly 70% correlation with home-price growth in 2016, which was the second-strongest correlation over the past 30 years. 2015 saw the strongest correlation. The 30-year average correlation is 25%, suggesting the current run up in home prices is on solid ground. “The high correlation between population and house-price growth does provide evidence that bubble-phobes need not worry that noneconomic fundamentals are pushing prices higher,” Mr. McLaughlin said. Mr. Kolko noted that if international immigration to these big cities were to slow and the population were to shrink, that could drive down home prices and make them more appealing to domestic migrants. The Canadian city of Vancouver, which recently cracked down on foreign purchases, has seen a big drop in home values.",0

773,"Daily Caller","On today’s episode, we discuss President Donald Trump’s Oval Office speech from Tuesday night, the Democratic response, and the media’s so-called fact check on the president.
Listen to the show:
Immediately after the president’s speech to the nation, the media was on its way to making it the most fact-checked speech in history. No detail was too insignificant to be checked. But those fact checks told the audience more about the journalists behind them than they did about the truth of anything the president said. Unambiguous truths were declared to be misleading or lies through twisted logic and absurd nitpicking.
Liberal darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ignored the murder of California police officer Ronil Singh by an illegal alien, instead accusing ICE agents of killing illegal immigrants and wondering why they should receive government funding in the first place. She’s more concerned with the treatment of illegal aliens detained at the border than she is with the murder of American citizens. You have to hear the audio to believe it.
Plus, Darth Vader Ginsburg missed her second day of oral arguments in the Supreme Court after cancer surgery, and Alabama residents had to be warned not to eat chicken tenders that had spilled out all over a freeway after a semi-truck overturned. You can’t make this stuff up.",1
339,"Breitbart","Border Patrol agents in South Texas discovered 30 illegal immigrants being smuggled in the back of a tractor-trailer at the Falfurrias Checkpoint. The find led to the arrest of men, women, and children who were placed into dangerous conditions in an attempt to sneak through the checkpoint located 80 miles from the Mexican border. Agents found eight more being smuggled in two pickup trucks that were allegedly driven by members of the same family. Agents assigned to the Falfurrias Border Patrol Checkpoint in the Rio Grande Valley Sector discovered a load of illegal immigrants after a K-9 alerted to suspicious cargo in the trailer. Following the early Saturday morning alert, the agents directed the driver of the 18-wheeler to move his rig to the secondary inspection station, Border Patrol officials said in a statement provided to OutletName Texas on Tuesday morning. An inspection of the trailer revealed 30 illegal immigrants hiding within the cargo of the truck. Officials said the load consisted of men, women, and children from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Mexico. The Rio Grande Valley Sector continuously leads the nation in the arrest of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) and Family Unit Aliens (FMUA), OutletName Texas reported. Agents arrested the driver and took the migrants into custody for processing for immigration violations. “These smuggling tactics continue to place immigrants in extreme danger,” Rio Grande Valley Sector Chief Patrol Agent Manuel Padilla, Jr. said in a written statement. “With summer approaching, we will continue to work with our local, state, and federal partners, as well as the community, to prevent senseless tragedies.” On March 26, a K-9 agent alerted to a Ford pickup truck that arrived at the Falfurrias Checkpoint. An inspection of the truck led to the discovery of an illegal immigrant in the cabin and three more hiding in a bed frame. A few minutes later, agents observed a Dodge truck approaching the same checkpoint. After a K-9 alerted, agents referred the driver to a secondary inspection station. The agents found two migrants hiding in the truck’s cabin and another two more hiding in a sofa in the back. Agents determined both drivers were from the same family and placed them both in custody. All three drivers are expected to be prosecuted on human smuggling charges. The illegal immigrants are being processed for immigration violations and will be turned over to immigration officials for processing. During FY 2018 (through February 28), RGV Sector agents arrested 9,729 illegal immigrants including 2,923 families and 1,406 unaccompanied minors.",1

In company emails, interviews and posts published online, leaders from companies including Apple Inc. AAPL -0.59%decrease; red down pointing triangle and Microsoft Corp. MSFT -1.66%decrease; red down pointing triangle framed the order as one at odds with a nation that welcomes foreigners and an industry that counts foreign-born executives in its upper ranks. In doing so, they broke with weeks of cautious engagement with the new administration. Here is a rundown of their statements. Apple CEO Tim Cook
Team,
In my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I’ve made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration—both to our company and to our nation’s future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do. I’ve heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support. There are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday’s immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them. We’re providing resources on AppleWeb for anyone with questions or concerns about immigration policies. And we have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our co-workers and our company. As I’ve said many times, diversity makes our team stronger. And if there’s one thing I know about the people at Apple, it’s the depth of our empathy and support for one another. It’s as important now as it’s ever been, and it will not weaken one bit. I know I can count on all of you to make sure everyone at Apple feels welcome, respected and valued. Apple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship. Our employees represent the finest talent in the world, and our team hails from every corner of the globe. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, “We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella
As an immigrant and as a CEO, I’ve both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world. We will continue to advocate on this important topic. Microsoft President Brad Smith
As a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system. We also believe in broader immigration opportunities, like the protections for talented and law-abiding young people under the Deferred Access for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program, often called “Dreamers.” We believe that immigration laws can and should protect the public without sacrificing people’s freedom of expression or religion. And we believe in the importance of protecting legitimate and law-abiding refugees whose very lives may be at stake in immigration proceedings. Google CEO Sundar Pichai
We’re upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the U.S.…It’s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues. Uber Technologies CEO Travis Kalanick
Our People Ops team has already reached out to the dozen or so employees who we know are affected: for example, those who live and work in the U.S., are legal residents but not naturalized citizens will not be able to get back into the country if they are traveling outside of the U.S. now or anytime in the next 90 days. Anyone who believes that this order could impact them should contact  immediately. This order has far broader implications as it also affects thousands of drivers who use Uber and come from the listed countries, many of whom take long breaks to go back home to see their extended family. These drivers currently outside of the U.S. will not be able to get back into the country for 90 days. That means they will not be able to earn a living and support their families—and of course they will be separated from their loved ones during that time. We are working out a process to identify these drivers and compensate them pro bono during the next three months to help mitigate some of the financial stress and complications with supporting their families and putting food on the table. We will have more details on this in the coming days. Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi
Ours is a nation of immigrants. These are our roots, this is our soul. All erased with the stroke of a pen. I was incredibly fortunate to arrive in the U.S. with my family after the Iranian revolution. I don’t have an Iranian passport and have never been back but have no idea if I’m on a list someplace listed as an Iranian citizen. And I’m a lucky one. We should strive for safe borders.

My great-grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. Priscilla’s parents were refugees from China and Vietnam. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that. Like many of you, I’m concerned about the impact of the recent executive orders signed by President Trump. We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources, while millions of undocumented folks who don’t pose a threat will live in fear of deportation.

889,"Daily Caller","MSOutletName’s Joe Scarborough compared Wednesday’s White House press briefing immigration spat to Hitler’s famous autobiography on “Morning Joe” Thursday.
“Where things seem to really melt down was when Jim Acosta talked, and we’re not, we’re certainly not putting this on Jim Acosta … but when Jim Acosta used the language, that it seems like your polices are trying to engineer racial and ethnic percentages or something, it sure sounded like something that you would read out of like ‘Mein Kampf or something,” Scarborough said.
OutletName White House Correspondent Jim Acosta debated with senior White House adviser Stephen Miller over concerns that the Trump administration would discriminate and try to push social engineering. Acosta raised concerns that immigrants from English speaking countries like Great Britain and Australia would get preferential treatment, while minority communities would be marginalized. Miller shot back, accusing Acosta of ignorance to think that only people from Great Britain and Australia speak English.
Commentary magazine editor and “Morning Joe” panelist John Podhoretz mocked Acosta’s reference to the Statue of Liberty and said, “Having a reporter yammer at a White House official by quoting Emma Lazarus’ poem at the base of the State of Liberty as though that’s the basis for policy, something written in 1883, we’re living in 2017 … it was so obnoxious.”
Scarborough said Acosta’s accusations were “something we would have accused the Serbs of doing back in the 1990’s. At that point it went off the rails.”
Washington Examiner Columnist Tim Carney added, “This is why people hate the press.”",1
766,"Daily Caller","Journalists were quick to take to Twitter and the airwaves as soon as President Donald Trump’s primetime plea for a border wall was broadcast Tuesday evening.
Trump discussed public safety, economic and illicit drug issues he said stem from illegal immigration as the partial government shutdown triggered by his push for border wall funding hit Day 18.
Members of the media reacted almost immediately.
“I see the president’s face but I hear Stephen Miller’s voice,” tweeted Maggie Haberman of OutletName, referring to Trump’s senior policy advisor who has defended shutting down the government for border security. “How is this a call for bipartisanship?” she added.
Other journalists appeared in network fact checks between Trump’s address and Democrats’ rebuttal.
“Just because you say it’s a crisis doesn’t necessarily make it one,” Cecilia Vega of OutletName said, referencing Trump’s characterization of the issue as a “crisis at our southern border.”
Others called Trump racist.
“Sickening to hear Trump try to bait the Latino and Black communities with false, racist trope about immigrants taking jobs,” tweeted OutletName political commentator Karen Finney. “If he really cared about people of color in the U.S. he would stop his nativist agenda and would’ve easily denounced the KKK in Charlottesville for starters.”
“Why is Trump asking for more money for his wall now that Democrats control the U.S. House than he did when the Republicans controlled everything? He needs to create a fight to distract from Muller Muller Muller Muller,” Finney later tweeted.
Washington Post media reporter Erik Wemple found Trump’s address to be more of the same.
“Looks like the White House secured major network TV time for an address that repeats all of the president’s arguments on immigration, only, this time, through a TelePrompTer,” Wemple wrote on Twitter.",1
728,"Daily Caller","The Supreme Court announced Monday that it will review lower court rulings blocking enforcement of President Donald Trump’s executive order on refugee and migrant entry, and stayed injunctions barring the order’s enforcement.
The announcement is a major victory for the president, whose signature immigration policy has been stymied repeatedly by the federal courts.
The justices consolidated two travel ban cases from the 4th and 9th Circuits, and scheduled oral arguments for the first session of the Court’s next term, which begins in October. They also partially vacated several lower court injunctions barring enforcement of the order’s travel ban provision, which prohibits the entry of foreign nationals from six countries with high instances of terrorism for a 90-day period.
“We grant the government’s applications to stay the injunctions, to the extent the injunctions prevent enforcement of 2(c) with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.”
Two classes of foreign national from the six countries named in the order may still enter the United States; aliens with relatives in America, or individuals with a meaningful connection to corporate entities and educational institutions in the United States will not be affected by the order.
“To prevent the government from pursuing that objective by enforcing 2(c) against foreign nationals unconnected to the United States would appreciably injure its interests, without alleviating obvious hardship to anyone else,” the Court wrote.
The Court also will allow the order’s provisions concerning refugee resettlement to take effect, with the same exceptions it provided for the travel ban. The directive reduces the number of refugees the United States will accept from 110,000 to 50,000, and denies refugee entry for 120 days.
As such, most of the president’s order will take effect within the next few days.
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote an opinion concurring and dissenting in part with the Court’s decision, joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. Thomas argued the stays should be issued in full, without exception. He writes:
I fear that the Court’s remedy will prove unworkable. Today’s compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding—on peril of contempt— whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country. See ante, at 11– 12. The compromise also will invite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits, as parties and courts struggle to determine what exactly constitutes a “bona fide relationship,” who precisely has a “credible claim” to that relationship, and whether the claimed relationship was formed ‘simply to avoid §2(c)’ of [the] Executive Order.
The National Immigration Law Center, an immigrant advocacy group litigating against the order, vowed to continue their fight against the travel restrictions.
“Today’s unanimous Supreme Court decision is a clear victory for our national security,” the president said. “It allows the travel suspension for the six terror-prone countries and the refugee suspension to become largely effective.”
“My number one responsibility as Commander in Chief is to keep the American people safe,” he added. “Today’s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation’s homeland. I am also particularly gratified that the Supreme Court’s decision was 9-0.”
It is not immediately clear that the ruling was unanimous. The Court issued its decision unsigned, and did not include a tally of the justice’s votes, as is typical of per curiam opinions. Five votes were needed to issue the stays, and four to review the lower court rulings. Given Thomas’ opinion dissenting as to the scope of the stay, it is safe to say there was a high degree of consensus — if Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch supported a broader stay, then at least five of the other six justices supported the stay the Court tailored. However, one cannot definitively say it was unanimous.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions expressed confidence that the high court would ultimately uphold the legality of the president’s order.
“Through Article II of the Constitution, the founders of our country vested the Executive Branch with a great responsibility: to ensure the national security of our country,” he said. “I am committed to defending the President’s ability to exercise that responsibility and the Department of Justice is confident that the United States Supreme Court will uphold this constitutional and necessary executive order.”",1

158,"FoxNews","On Tuesday night, President Trump will deliver a primetime address to all Americans, speaking about the crisis at our southern border. As we speak, a partial government shutdown is still in effect as Democrats bury their heads in the sand, close their eyes and pretend that America's borders are totally safe and secure.
They are not. In fact, Democrats are adamantly refusing to give border patrol agents the tools they desperately need and are asking for. And that is a strategic wall on the southern border. But now, even one top Democrat is admitting that President Trump does, in fact, have the power to build a wall without any congressional approval whatsoever.
""There's a provision in law that says the president can declare an emergency,"" said U.S. Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., in an interview on OutletName. ""It's been done a number of times. But primarily, it's been done to build facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq. In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, 'Where is the emergency?'""
Where is the emergency? We will answer that question. Pay attention to the following statistics, that, of course, the hate-Trump media, hate-Trump Democrats, are not telling you, that they're ignoring.
Now, in the past two years alone, criminal aliens have been responsible for approximately -- look at this number -- 235,000 violations of the law, including 4,000 homicides, 30,000 sex crimes and -- get this -- over 100,000 violent assaults. In just 2018, 17,000 individuals with criminal records were apprehended at the border.
And the crisis goes much, much deeper. In towns and cities all across the country, we know about the opioid crisis, 300 Americans are killed every single week from heroin; 90 percent of that heroin is flooding across our southern border. That death toll, by the way, is equal to -- think about this -- the number of American troops killed every week in Vietnam during the year 1968. That was the war's deadliest year.
And over a 10-year period, the total Americans killed from illegal drugs coming across the southern border will be nearly three times higher than the total number of U.S. troops killed in Vietnam. There is your crisis, by any definition.
For us and most Americans, this is not a political game. We are seeing this is as about life and death. This is about innocent, brave, law-abiding Americans and legal immigrants literally dying because our borders are not secure.
But don't expect to see this on any other network. Of course, Donald Trump wants something, and they are just against it. Instead of reporting facts and truths, they seem content with just trashing Trump voters, blaming us for seeing the truth. Over on fake news OutletName, commentator Rick Wilson first trashed Trump supporters, suggesting that we didn't have teeth. Now, he's saying we are not sophisticated enough; we're not smart enough to understand the issue involving border security.
And while fake news OutletName insults our intelligence, conspiracy-TV, MSOutletName, are referring to Americans - we the people - as cowards. Remember last week, when I was talking about how we have the hate-Trump media? And I told you about the information crisis? Personal attacks will never stop this show from reporting truths.
For us and most Americans, this is not a political game. We are seeing this is as about life and death. This is about innocent, brave, law-abiding Americans and legal immigrants literally dying because our borders are not secure.
Now, we know the story of Officer Ronil Singh. He was gunned down by an illegal immigrant just after Christmas. He was just put to rest this weekend. His 5-month-old son will never know his father. That's life and death.
And the person responsible for that heinous attack had a criminal track record. He should have been turned over to ICE. He should have been deported. But in California, they have sanctuary cities. The whole state is a sanctuary state, and those policies prevented that from happening. Government policies are now literally aiding and abetting lawbreaking and paving the way for future crimes. Why do you think the government would act and aid and abet criminals?
And like every other Democrat, you have the now-former governor of California, Jerry Brown, burying his head in the sand. But really, he ought to be taking responsibility. Sanctuary states literally prevent criminals that would normally have been handed over to ICE, from being being detained. It makes it illegal. That means they go free. What happened to Office Singh is all too common an occurrence.
Now, have you heard the name of Pierce Corcoran? On December 29, he was killed by a suspected illegal immigrant driving without a license, without insurance and on the wrong side of the highway. Pierce was only 22 years old.
The American people and the public need to start asking some really important, tough questions. How many of our fellow citizens have been murdered because of unsecured borders? Now, if that's not a national emergency, I don't know how we would ever define one.

1472,"WSJ","The immigration debate that begins Monday in the Senate promises to be the rarest of things in Washington: a freewheeling, open-ended battle over one of the thorniest subjects, with the expected outcome completely unclear. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) will begin debate on a shell bill that has no immigration provisions, to be filled in with senators’ amendments. The process could take days or weeks, depending on the number of amendments offered and the amount of time Mr. McConnell wishes to devote to a single policy area. It is rare these days for a bill to come to the floor that doesn’t have built-in support from the majority party; even rarer still one that is essentially an empty vessel—to be filled with the ideas of whichever group of senators can come up with the needed votes. The primary goal for many senators is to protect young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children, who will soon lose Obama-era protections. But the lawmakers will consider a wide range of other ideas aimed at combating illegal immigration and overhauling the system of legal immigration. “It’s real debate on an issue where we really don’t know what the outcome is going to be,” Sen. Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.) told OutletName on Sunday. “We haven’t done that in a while.” On one end of the spectrum will be an amendment reflecting President Donald Trump’s framework, to be introduced by seven conservative senators. It combines a path to citizenship for 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants with $25 billion for a border wall and other security measures, and new limits that would ultimately reduce legal immigration by about a third. It also seeks to speed deportations for children who cross the border alone and family units, both of whom get special treatment under current law. For instance, children from Central America would have their deportation cases quickly decided, as is the case for children from Mexico. The legislation would also allow family units to be kept in immigration jails while they wait for rulings. On the other end, Democrats are expected to seek a vote on the Dream Act, the legislation that gave “Dreamers” their nickname, which provides a path to citizenship for a larger group of young undocumented immigrants without including border security or other more conservative provisions. Neither the Trump framework nor the Dream Act are expected to pass. The question is whether anything in between can. Even if an immigration bill is passed by the Senate, there’s no guarantee it will go anywhere in the House. Speaker Paul Ryan has said he would only bring legislation to the House floor that Mr. Trump supports, and Mr. Trump has insisted his plan be the one the Senate advances.But even if no bill makes it out of Congress, getting lawmakers on the record about such a touchy issue could have wide implications for this year’s midterm elections. In 2013, the last time the Senate debate immigration, senators approved a sweeping, bipartisan bill, backed by then-President Barack Obama, only to see it die in the GOP-controlled House. It’s possible that a solution will emerge from a bipartisan group that forced this week’s Senate debate as a way to end last month’s brief government shutdown. Members of the group, which meets in the offices of Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine), say they are getting closer to releasing one or perhaps multiple amendments, with the aim of pulling enough support from both Republicans and Democrats to pass the Senate. “The question is, Will we be in a position to be able to bring everyone together around this proposal at the right moment?” said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.). Lawmakers are working against a March 5 deadline, when the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program expires. Mr. Trump ended DACA in September and gave Congress six months to legislate a replacement. A federal court has mandated that the administration continue to accept renewals for now, but it could be overturned. The debate centers on four areas of immigration, each with its own complications. Protections for the young undocumented immigrants may be the easiest piece of the puzzle. Mr. Trump has agreed to go along with a path to citizenship for about 1.8 million people who were eligible for DACA. Border security, the second element, has become less contentious since Senate Democrats made clear they would go along with a substantial amount of money to expand an existing border wall. One wrinkle involves some Democrats’ push to also include protections for parents of Dreamers. Sen. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), a longtime sponsor of the Dream Act, is pushing for that as a way to keep families together, but many Republicans balk. Still, there is little consensus on Trump-backed policy changes aimed at making it harder for certain illegal migrants to put off deportation and win protections in the U.S. A number of senators have argued that the best approach is to keep the legislation focused on DACA and border security. They say it would be too difficult to find agreement on anything more given that it takes 60 votes in the Senate to advance any bill. “If we stay focused on those two, I think we can get to 60,” said Sen. Chris Coons (D., Del.). “The challenge is, there’s lots of other proposals that both the White House and other members want addressed.” One involves family migration policy. Under current law, U.S. citizens can sponsor spouses, children, parents and siblings for green cards. Mr. Trump, deriding the system as “chain migration,” wants to limit that to just spouses and minor children. Senate Democrats agreed to limits on family-based migration as part of a 2013 immigration bill. But that was a comprehensive bill that included, among other things, a path to citizenship for some 11 million undocumented immigrants, well over the 1.8 million young people covered by the Trump plan. Finally, there is the diversity visa lottery, which each year makes eligible for green cards 50,000 people from countries that are underrepresented in the immigration system, many in Africa. In the past, Democrats have been willing to reallocate these visas, and last week, administration officials sought to clarify that they aren’t seeking to cut the total number of green cards issued. Some senators said there was consensus building around the idea of overhauling the visa program without ending it. For all the positive vibes, many are pessimistic about Congress coming to agreement. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said last week that a short-term extension of Dreamers’ temporary status combined with some sort of border-security provision may be the most Congress and the White House can agree to. “If I were a betting man, I would always bet on the punt, that Congress will punt,” he said. “I just hope we don’t punt on first down. We at least go to the fourth down.”",0
836,"Daily Caller","An illegal immigrant activist claimed Monday that “white supremacist politicians” who oppose amnesty have “one goal,” and that is to imprison and deport all “people of color.”
“Make no mistake. This is our home and we are here to stay,” Greisa Martinez Rosas, director of advocacy policy at United We Dream, said on a conference call with reporters.
United We Dream claims to be the largest immigrant youth-led organization in the country and held the call a day before nationwide rallies Tuesday on the fifth anniversary of the DACA program launched by President Obama.
The program protects roughly 800,000 illegal immigrants from deportation and allows them to work. President Trump vowed to end the program, but has yet to do so.
“The DACA program is under threat by white supremacist politicians,” Rosas, an illegal immigrant, said. “White supremacist politicians who have one goal: to push all people of color in jails, and into detention camps, off the voter rolls and out of our country.”
United We Dream did not respond to a request for comment about who these white supremacist politicians are.
The White House continues to maintain that it is reviewing what to do with the DACA program. Ten Republican state attorneys general have threatened to sue the federal government if it continues to accept applications and renewals for the program by September 1. The Trump administration could decide to refuse to defend the program much like the Obama administration did with the Defense of Marriage Act.",1
1470,"WSJ","A Trump administration policy of separating immigrant children from adults at the southern border is putting pressure on Republicans and threatening to engulf broader negotiations on Capitol Hill about dealing with those already in the U.S. illegally. The administration’s “zero-tolerance policy” of detaining adults attempting to cross into the U.S. has resulted in the division of families traveling with children, and the federal government is beginning to run out of space for its detainees. Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, a Republican whose district spans 800 miles of the Mexico border and who is locked in a competitive race for his seat, toured a temporary tent facility on the southern border the administration constructed to house the swelling number of separated children. He used the tour to distance himself from the administration’s policy. “This really isn’t a Republican or Democratic issue,” Mr. Hurd told OutletName following the tour. “This is an issue about how should you treat children.” Meanwhile, divided Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill are trying to show results on the issue of illegal immigration ahead of midterm elections in which centrists and conservatives are facing competing demands from voters. President Donald Trump will attend a meeting of the House Republican conference Tuesday night, and immigration is likely to be one of the topics on the agenda, said Marc Short, the president’s legislative affairs chief, in an interview Sunday. “The policy is incredibly complicated and it is one we need to do a better job of communicating,” Mr. Short said, of the issue of separating families. “We’ve not talked about the history of how we got to this point.” The GOP-controlled House of Representatives may vote on two Republican-crafted immigration measures this week, said the office of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.). One bill is assembled by negotiators from the GOP’s moderate and conservative wings; another is more conservative. Both aim to address the fate of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought illegally to the U.S. as children, as well as seeking to increase border security. Each would also broadly allow children arriving at the southern border to be detained with their parents in the same facility, or for the release of a child to a relative. The White House has said that Mr. Trump would sign either bill if it passed. In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) was bruised by the collapse of an immigration bid earlier this year and has been skeptical that the Senate would take it up again while Republicans remain in possession of a slim 51-vote majority. He has said only that if the House passes something, and the president supports it, he would be willing to reconsider. A decades-old court settlement bars the U.S. government from jailing migrant children. Until recently, the result was that families who crossed the border seeking asylum were often released into the U.S. while their cases are pursued. The Department of Homeland Security said Friday that it had separated 1,995 immigrant children from 1,940 adults, whom it described as “alleged adult parents,” at the border between mid-April and the end of May. The administration hasn’t said what percentage of adult immigrants have been prosecuted, though Homeland Security has said it has implemented a zero-tolerance policy for all adults and is referring every such immigrant for prosecution. DHS and the Justice Department haven’t said how officials decide which cases to prosecute and which families to separate. In May, more than 9,400 people traveling as families were arrested at the Mexican border, along with about 6,400 children who were traveling alone. Since the start of the budget year in October, more than 32,000 unaccompanied immigrant children have been taken into custody by the U.S. Border Patrol along the Mexican border. That is a 4% increase over the same period in 2017. Separately, more than 59,000 people traveling as families have been arrested at the border during that same period, a slight decrease over 2017. Mr. Short said Republicans needed to do more to emphasize their arguments that immigration rules had created an incentive for adults to seek to make dangerous border crossings with children in tow, and that establishing more beds to house children and adults together would untie border security officials’ hands. Democratic lawmakers spent the weekend visiting detention facilities at the southern border and elsewhere, including a group of New York and New Jersey Democrats that toured a center in Elizabeth, N.J., to make their case. “Republicans control every branch of government,” said Rep. Bill Pascrell (D., N.J.). “They are making these disgraces happen every day.” The administration is facing increasing pressure on existing facilities, even without the possibility of new facilities to detain families together. The Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement is adding bed space after eclipsing more than 11,000 children in its custody. A temporary, soft-sided structure has been erected in Tornillo, Texas, near El Paso, as part of that expansion. Eric Hargan, deputy secretary of HHS, said in a statement Sunday that the agency had welcomed lawmakers’ tours and that the semi-permanent structures—including at Tornillo—had ventilation and cooling “to ensure appropriate temperature” for the minors placed there, who, he said, were all teenagers. Mr. Trump and other advisers had maintained that it is up to Congress—and specifically Democrats, whose votes would be needed to pass legislation in the Senate—to put an end to the family separations. Mr. Trump has insisted that Congress adopt tighter border security in response, including offering funding for his long-promised border wall. On Monday morning, the president again tried to put the onus on Democrats, even as Republicans control enough seats in the House, though not in the Senate, to pass an immigration bill on their own. In a tweet, Mr. Trump wrote: “Why don’t the Democrats give us the votes to fix the world’s worst immigration laws? Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including MS-13, coming into our country illegally?” MS-13 refers to a street gang linked to immigrants from Central America. His office of the press secretary had also sent out talking points late Friday arguing that American families were victims of “permanent separation” when they were subjected to violent crimes committed by immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Some allies continued to make that case for Mr. Trump Sunday. Former chief strategist Steve Bannon, appearing on OutletName’ “This Week with George Stephanopoulos,” said that he believed the policy required no defensive posture. “It’s zero tolerance, I don’t think you have to justify it,” Mr. Bannon said. But elsewhere, signs of a shift emerged. “As a mother, as a Catholic, as someone who’s got a conscience. I will tell you that nobody likes this policy,” said Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, on OutletName’s “Meet the Press.” First lady Melania Trump issued a rare policy statement on Sunday. “Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,” said her spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham. “She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.” The issue has also drawn criticism from the United Nations’ human-rights chief. Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein in a speech Monday called for the U.S. to stop separating migrant children from their parents, saying the practice was unconscionable.",0
2156,"USA Today","Jorge Garcia, an undocumented immigrant who entered the U.S. at age 10, was deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from Detroit on Jan. 15, 2018, forcing him to return to his native Mexico and leave his wife and children - all U.S. citizens - behind. The political debate over the fate of ""DREAMers"" — undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children — has overlooked just how many there are in the country today: about 3.6 million.
That number of people whose lives risk being uprooted is not widely known, in large part because so much public attention has been focused recently on 800,000 mostly young DREAMers accepted into the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.
This smaller group of DREAMers is in the spotlight because President Trump terminated DACA in September, saying it was an illegal overreach of executive authority that can only come from Congress, which is negotiating with Trump on a compromise immigration plan.
While many politicians use DREAMer and DACA interchangeably, the terms are ""not a distinction without a difference,"" said House Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
The 3.6 million estimate of undocumented immigrants brought to U.S. before their 18th birthday comes from the Migration Policy Institute, a non-profit research group that promotes better understanding of immigration issues. That is roughly a third of all undocumented immigrants in the country and does not include millions of their immediate family members who are U.S. citizens.
A number so large raises the stakes for both sides in the dispute over whether to deport DREAMers, allow them to stay under prescribed conditions or provide them with a path to citizenship.
Ali Noorani, executive director of the pro-immigrant National Immigration Forum, said exposing millions of DREAMers to deportations would be a moral and economic calamity.
""At a time when our economy is growing and our labor market is extremely tight, these are all folks of working age who have skills to immediately contribute,"" Noorani said. ""We would be spending billions of dollars to remove folks who have the potential to help the country grow.""
On the other side is Mark Krikorian, executive director for the Center for Immigration Status, which favors lower levels of immigration. He argues for only extending protections for the 800,000 in DACA. ""It's not like they're entitled to anything, but prudence suggests an extraordinary act of mercy,"" he said. ""Amnesty is warranted for them alone, at least this time.""
In exchange for DREAMer protections, Republicans want enhanced border security, the end of a diversity visa program for people from under-represented countries, including several from Africa, and a reduction in relatives that U.S. citizens can sponsor for visas.
The impact of what may happen to DREAMers was highlighted this week when Jorge Garcia, 39, a Detroit landscaper who has lived in the U.S. for 30 years, was deported back to his native Mexico even though he arrived in the country when he was 10 years. Garcia, whose wife and two children are all U.S. citizens, did not qualify for DACA because he was just over the age limit.
To qualify for DACA, created in 2012, DREAMers had to undergo a thorough background check, prove they arrived in the U.S. before their 16th birthday, were 30 or younger, were attending school or in the military, and had not committed a felony or serious misdemeanor. The program provided work permits and two-year reprieves from deportation that could be renewed.
Cecilia Muñoz, Obama's domestic policy director, said he chose to protect a limited number of DREAMers because he could go only so far through executive action. Now that Congress is involved, Muñoz said, far more DREAMers should be protected.
""The right policy is to be as generous as possible,"" Muñoz said. ""We know the success of DACA. It's good for the country, and this has overwhelming support around the country from people on both sides of the aisle. There's no reason to limit who is eligible.""
There are several legislative proposals that each protect different numbers of DREAMers. Some deal only with those who entered the country before their 16th birthday. Others set age limits and include education or military requirements and clean criminal records.
According to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute:
•The most generous proposal is the American Hope Act introduced by Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., which would provide legal status to 3.5 million DREAMers, excluding a small group who pose public safety threats.
•Another plan known as the DREAM Act presented to Trump by a bipartisan group of senators last week would allow 2.1 million to stay in the country.
""There is support across the country for allowing Dreamers — who have records of achievement — to stay, work, and reach their full potential,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said. ""We should not squander these young people’s talents and penalize our own nation.""
•Other proposals from Republicans would protect up to 1.7 million immigrants.
•The most restrictive proposals would provide legal status only to the 798,980 people approved for DACA.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has said it will not deport former DACA recipients if their protections expire. But under Trump's orders, it will arrest any undocumented immigrant agents come across. The percentage of undocumented immigrants without criminal records arrested by ICE has increased dramatically since Trump took office.
If Congress does not strike a deal by March 5, DACA enrollees will begin losing their deportation protections and work permits.",0
151,"FoxNews","President Trump lauded Washington Republicans’ successes last year and promised to build on that momentum with an ambitious 2018 agenda that includes rebuilding the military, achieving immigration reform and improving border security.
In a wide-ranging press conference from Camp David on Saturday, Trump also said he plans to campaign for GOP congressional candidates, and looks forward to perhaps improving relations with the rogue nation of North Korea in 2018.
“We are very well prepared for the coming year. We finished strong,” Trump said at his weekend political retreat at Camp David, in snow-covered western Maryland.
The president, in a roughly 20-minute-long press conference, also spoke about the ongoing special counsel investigation regarding whether Trump or his associates colluded with Russia during the 2016 White House race.
""Everything I've done is 100 percent proper,"" Trump said. ""That is what I do. I do things properly. … Just so you understand, there's been no collusion. There's been no crime.""
Trump also repeatedly said he and Republican leaders of the GOP-controlled Congress are eager to work with Democrats on a range of issues, even suggesting that they would postpone welfare reform without Democratic support.
However, he appeared to sharpen his hard line on bipartisan immigration reform, saying he won’t extend protection for young illegal immigrants under the expiring, Obama-era DACA program unless Democrats agree to fund his U.S.-Mexico wall as part of a comprehensive plan that includes strengthening American borders.
“I hope we are going to work out our agreements with the Democrats,” Trump said. But “we want the wall. The wall’s not going to happen, we’re not having DACA.”
He then reiterated his claims that Mexico would pay -- in some way -- for the wall along the border.
The president also spoke about stopping the flow of drugs into the United States, an issue that until Saturday did not appear to be at the forefront of his 2018 agenda.
“Drugs are pouring into the country,” he said. “I think we are going to put a big dent into that.”
Trump was joined at the press conference by congressional Republicans, Cabinet secretaries and White House aides.
“From a right-center point of view, 2017 was the most consequential year since I’ve been in Congress,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. “I’m excited about the new year. I’m excited to get to work.”
During the press conference, Trump expressed optimism about peace on the Korean Peninsula, where North Korean leader Kim Jung Un continues to pursue a nuclear weapon and an intercontinental missile on which to launch it.
He suggested the talks between North Korea and U.S. ally South Korea about the North joining the upcoming Olympic Games were “a start” toward potential de-escalation.
“If something can come out of those talks, that would be a great thing,” he said.
Trump said he would join the 2018 campaign trail for Republican candidates, saying “we are going to be very involved.”",1
2306,"USA Today","Non-citizens with legal status can enlist in the U.S. military and risk their lives in combat. But in most states they cannot be employed as police officers. Now dozens of police chiefs and sheriffs, alarmed at the shrinking numbers of qualified recruits, want to see the long-standing prohibition lifted.
“I don’t think someone’s citizenship is indicative in any way of someone’s suitability to be a police officer,” said Tom Manger, police chief in Montgomery County, Maryland, a suburb of Washington D.C. He co-chairs a national task force of policing executives lobbying legislatures to change the law in Maryland and elsewhere.
The movement is part of a broader recognition that the difficulty in recruiting police is not just a result of low pay and battered morale—the so-called Ferguson Effect—but of numerous obstacles thrown up by politicians or police themselves.
Jurisdiction by jurisdiction, those barriers are being challenged, often successfully.
A growing number of law enforcement agencies will now accept applicants who admit past drug use or have arrest records for low-level offenses, who lack college degrees and who sport tattoos or facial hair.
But frustrated cops say they are still being handcuffed by arcane state laws and slow-to-respond state oversight commissions.
In Massachusetts, officers and police applicants are disqualified if they smoke cigarettes, even off-duty.
Matthew Starr, an army veteran who had been deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, was rejected by the police department in Medfield, Massachusetts, near Boston, after a police officer secretly photographed Starr getting out of his pickup to smoke. Starr appealed to the state’s Civil Service Commission and lost.
“It doesn’t make sense to claim there is a shortage when you aren’t going to hire someone who smokes,” said Starr, who is now a 7th grade public school teacher. Being a cop “is a tough job, there’s no money, there is no respect in it, and these asinine laws don’t help either.”
Massachusetts is also one of several states where women are challenging physical requirements that impede the hiring and retention of female officers. Critics argue the rules have little to do with the demands of policing.
The state requires women to traverse the same arduous obstacle course as men. The fail rate for women was 20 percent compared to a rate of 2 percent for men, according to a data analysis by news station WCVB. The Massachusetts Human Resources Division settled a lawsuit in 2015 with a promise to revise the test, but the reforms have yet to be announced. All five branches of the U.S. military, meanwhile, offer varied fitness standards for basic training based on gender. Beginning in late 2020, the Army will switch to a physical testing system for already enlisted soldiers based on the strain of their assignments rather than gender and age.
Matthew Starr, a veteran of the U.S. Army, was rejected by the police department in Medfield, Massachusetts after he was photographed smoking.
Policing experts point out that law enforcement is historically slow to adapt to shifts in the cultural norms. Long after contact lenses were commonplace, police forces demanded 20/20 vision. Until the 1980s it was common for law enforcement agencies to shun gay cops on grounds that there would be “morale problems.”
Many police departments still ask applicants intrusive questions about their personal lives. A Marshall Project review of background check questionnaires found queries about “unusual” sexual acts (Cincinnati Police Department), attendance at cock or dog fights (Albuquerque Police Department) and whether an applicant has “given anything to anyone that was not yours to give away”. (Richmond Police Department in Virginia).
No issue is as fraught as the ban on applicants lacking full citizenship, at a time when President Trump has framed immigration as one of the country’s most polarizing debates.
According to a 2016 report by the U.S. Justice Department, more than 40 states have statutes, regulations, or administrative rules in place that restrict the ability of law enforcement agencies to employ non-citizens. The report, a survey of diversity in policing, notes that “this requirement may prevent a considerable number of racial and ethnic minorities—many of whom have valuable foreign language skills—from being hired by law enforcement agencies.”
Justin Levitt, a Justice Department official in the Obama administration, supervised discrimination cases against police departments that banned legal immigrants in the few states that allowed them to be hired as cops. Levitt questioned why legislatures continue to prevent police chiefs from employing who they want. “These laws tell local law enforcement that you have to hire someone less qualified based on the fact that they were born here,” Levitt said.
Manger’s group, called the Law Enforcement Immigration Task force, issued a white paper in 2017 urging that the citizenship requirement be lifted. Manger said the change might begin with legal immigrants who have been honorably discharged from the military.
“If you criticize these individuals, then you are criticizing someone who has military service,” Manger said. A bill to make green-card holders with military service eligible for policing died in the Maryland Senate last year, but its sponsor plans to reintroduce it.
Tennessee in 2015 amended its laws to open police recruitment to non-citizens with military service, after the police chief in Nashville rallied legislators. ""Having a cross-section of Nashville serving on the police department enhances our knowledge and appreciation of cultures so we can better serve our population,” said then Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson after the law was changed.
Not all jurisdictions in the state are following the reform. The Memphis Police Department still requires its applicants to be citizens. When the failure to comply with state law was brought to the city’s attention, spokeswoman Ursula Madden said Memphis officials were “in the process of updating the language.”
Montgomery County, Maryland, Police Chief Tom Manger has lobbied for the state to allow military veterans who are not citizens to be hired as police officers.
Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo wants a broader change, and says he is talking with a bipartisan group of state legislators to craft a bill that would allow law enforcement agencies to hire legal non-citizens who qualify, with or without a military background. “They came here legally like we asked them to do, and they have the heart, let’s remove that artificial wall, and let’s build a bridge to service. That’s what we should be doing,” said Acevedo who co-chairs the immigration task force along with Manger.
Opponents of allowing permanent residents to join police ranks say they don’t want to empower green-card holders to detain U.S. citizens. They also question whether an immigrant, who didn’t go through the naturalization process, could fairly practice constitutional policing. “If you want to become a cop, become a citizen,” said former Illinois U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh who is now a nationally syndicated conservative radio host.
In 2015, Walsh’s listeners flooded a village council meeting in suburban Chicago and loudly protested a proposal for the Mount Prospect Police Department to hire non-citizens. Due to the backlash, Mount Prospect officials dropped the idea. The police chief described the critics as a “lynch mob.”
The right of states to restrict police recruiting based on citizenship rests on a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the New York State Police’s refusal to accept the application of a legal permanent resident named Edmund Foley. “Police officials are clothed with authority to exercise an almost infinite variety of discretionary powers,” the court ruled. “A state may therefore confine the performance of this important public responsibility to those who are citizens.”
In 2016, the Obama administration fined the Denver sheriff's department $10,000 for incorrectly advertising that citizenship was a requirement for a deputy position. Colorado is one of a handful of states that allow non-citizens to apply for local law enforcement jobs. As part of the settlement, Denver agreed to track down green card holders who had been passed over for a job and reconsider them for employment.
One beneficiary of the new policy was Omar Barrios, a legal immigrant from Mexico but not yet a citizen. Now a deputy, he works at Denver’s downtown detention center. “Nobody ever asks me if I am a resident or a citizen,” he says. “I do my job like anyone else.”",0
585,"Breitbart","El Paso Sector Border Patrol officials report that at least 2,500 migrants illegally crossed the border along a small section of the New Mexico Border. The migrants crossed the border this fiscal year as part of large groups of Central American families and unaccompanied minors near the Antelope Wells Port of Entry.
In an area that normally only sees a few hundred illegal border crossings per year, El Paso Sector officials reported that 25 large groups of migrants crossed the border near the Antelope Wells Port of Entry in the first few months of Fiscal Year 2019. The Border Patrol defines a “large group” as more than 100 people, FOX14 reported.
This small section of the border is patrolled by agents assigned to the Lordsburg Station. Due to the remoteness of this area, agents are assigned to work from Camp Bounds Forward Operating Base at Antelope Wells, New Mexico. The Lordsburg Station falls under the supervision of the El Paso Sector.
During the entirety of Fiscal Year 2018, which ended on September 30, 2018, the El Paso Sector reported apprehending a total of 31,561 migrants. Those included 12,312 family units and 5,461 unaccompanied minors, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s 2018 Southwest Border Migration Report. Officials told OutletName News in December that the Lordsburg station’s apprehensions represent a small portion of those numbers. And, the Camp Bounds Forward Operating Base, located in the extreme southwestern part of the New Mexico boot heel, accounted for a small portion of that.
However, since the new fiscal year began on October 1, 2018, at least 25 groups of more than 100 migrants have been apprehended. OutletName14 reported that Border Patrol agents apprehended nearly 300 migrants last week alone — one group of 247 and a second group of 115.
Officials told the local OutletName affiliate that smugglers have started using the large groups of migrants as a distraction to tie up Border Patrol agents while they smuggle drugs across the border elsewhere.
Officials said that at about the same time the agents engaged with this very large group of migrants, drug smugglers reportedly moved a load of 265 pounds of marijuana across the border west of Antelope Wells.
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the pressure on Border Patrol agents due to the unsecured border is pushing the system “to a breaking point.”
Now it appears that drug smugglers are attempting to take advantage of the overwhelming nature of the crisis at our southern border by exploiting these families and children and pushing them to remote and desolate areas of the border to make their crossing.

2500,"Reuters","Former vice president and Democratic candidate Joe Biden on Wednesday unveiled proposals that include new protections for immigrants and increased foreign aid that he would pursue as president, drawing a sharp contrast with President Donald Trump. The policy plans distributed by Biden’s campaign do not include funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border championed by Trump. Biden, who is seeking his party’s nomination to face Republican Trump in the November 2020 election, would increase the number of refugees allowed into the United States, bolster resources for dealing with asylum cases and stop separating parents from their children at the border. Democrats fault Trump’s approach on those policies, as well as for his signature campaign promise for the border wall. Biden promised to instead fund better screening technology at the border. Biden also would propose a $4 billion package of assistance to Central American countries, including El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, which have been a source of large numbers of asylum seekers at U.S. ports of entry. The new proposals come as Biden, 77, seeks to build a broad base of support that includes immigrants and racial minorities. On Wednesday, he is campaigning in Las Vegas, which has a relatively large immigrant and Latino population. Nevada on Feb. 22 will be the third state to hold its Democratic presidential nominating contest, with Biden facing 14 Democratic rivals. Some of Biden’s rivals and activists have criticized the Obama administration’s immigration record that included large numbers of deportations when Biden served as vice president. Biden’s proposals include restoring protections against deportation for about 661,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the United States when they were children. Trump has moved to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that provided those protections, but he has been blocked by courts so far. Biden also promised to protect a class of immigrants with Temporary Protected Status because of natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event from being sent back to unsafe places. The Trump administration has tried to end some of those protections, saying most countries in the program have recovered from the related disasters. That issue is also subject of a court battle. For millions of undocumented immigrants without special status, Biden promised to work with Congress to pass legislation setting out a path to citizenship, a decades-long aspiration for presidents in both parties.",0
94,"FoxNews","President Trump backed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Tuesday in the face of growing Democratic calls to abolish the agency -- a day after the White House had targeted individual lawmakers for their attacks.
“When we have an “infestation” of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE!” Trump tweeted. “They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments [sic] that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov.”
The tweet comes in response to growing calls from Democratic lawmakers and candidates to abolish the agency known as ICE in the wake of the Trump administration’s tougher stance on border security and enforcement of immigration laws.
In particular, the controversy surrounding the Department of Justice’s “zero tolerance” policy on prosecuting all illegal border crossers has brought a number of Democratic lawmakers on board with what was once a fringe position.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., both rumored to be in the running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, have called for the abolition of ICE, while Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has said the U.S. should consider “starting from scratch” in overhauling the agency.
The calls come after far-left primary challenger and ICE opponent Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shocked the party’s establishment last week by beating Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y.
On Monday, the White House targeted Harris and Warren individually on Twitter, accusing Harris of “supporting the animals of MS-13.'
“You must not know what ICE really does,” the tweets read.
Trump has repeatedly connected criticism of border and immigration enforcement with a softness or even support of MS-13 -- the gang started by Central American immigrants in the 1980s and known for its particularly brutal crimes and motto: “Kill, rape, control.”
“[Democrats] want them taken care of. They want them to be left alone,” Trump said last month.
On Tuesday, he indicated that he believed that the “abolish ICE” stance would hurt Democrats in future elections.
“How can the Democrats, who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime, do well in November,” he said. “The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security, while the Democrats are more interested in ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great Law Enforcement!”",1
232,"FoxNews","The Pentagon will deploy 1,000 more troops to the southern border  week, a senior U.S. defense official said Friday afternoon.
The additional forces will bring the total to nearly 6,000 active-duty and National Guard personnel deployed in support of the Department of Homeland Security at the border with Mexico, one week after President Trump declared a state of emergency to free up funding for a promised border wall.
SOME 5,200 TROOPS DEPLOYING TO BORDER
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday the House will vote Tuesday to reject Trump’s national emergency when Congress returns  week. The president has promised to veto any such effort to undo his emergency declaration, which is also being challenged in the courts.
Trump wants to spend roughly $6 billion from the Pentagon budget, $2.5 billion from its drug interdiction program and $3.5 billion from the military construction bill, to pay for the wall.
For years, it has been the practice to request approval from Congress before reallocating Defense Department funds, the senior defense official said, but also told reporters a congressional sign-off is “not required.”
More than 5,000 U.S. active-duty forces were ordered to the southern border in late October ahead of the midterm elections, and as a caravan of thousands of migrants traveled up toward the U.S. from Central America.
Since then, the mission has been extended two times. Earlier this year, Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan said U.S. forces would remain on the border through the end of September, due to the painstaking work of laying more than 100 miles of barbed wire, and offering aviation, surveillance and other support.
So far, U.S. troops have strung roughly 70 miles of concertina wire, said the official.
“We’re laying down another 140 miles of concertina wire, about 30 percent done with that,” the official added.",1
676,"Daily Caller","If you look at the latest multi-agency law enforcement operation during October 2018 in Lawrence, Massachusetts, it should be very apparent that our country has been invaded by the violent Mexican Cartels. They are making millions of dollars and taking complete advantage of the addicted population.
The street networks of cartels and illegal immigrants are moving around the region, pushing poison to our citizens, and thriving. They are currently the driving force behind the nation’s unprecedented drug crisis.
Politicians need to step up and secure the border now. We can’t afford to lose Americans at the alarming rate of almost 200 per day to drug overdoses.
The massive busts in Lawrence depict how bad the situation is around the United States as ICE detained or issued indictments for 50 illegal or criminal aliens who were operating with this organization. Officials in the area have made it clear that the sanctuary policies of Lawrence has provided the illegals with a safe haven to operate and ultimately kill our citizens.
Sadly, many of the public officials have been in a state of denial and have no sense of urgency for this crisis. This warped sense of reality is also the sentiment by other public figures trying to win elections.
The Ohio and New England regions have been especially hard hit by the opioid crisis. If it wasn’t for our dedicated first responders who administer Narcan daily, the death rates would be through the roof.
We have seen successful law enforcement operations all over these regions taking down massive amounts of fentanyl and heroin while arresting numerous criminals. Two milligrams of fentanyl can kill an adult, according to the experts in the DEA. That equates to the fact that over 200,000 people can die from one pound of this poison.
Yes, it’s true our population first started consuming mass amounts of opioids from the medicine cabinet and there has been serious over prescribing for years. But now the addicted have turned to a less expensive alternative on the streets.
Unfortunately, the cartels don’t have any quality control and are mixing the poisonous chemicals with heroin and cocaine and making counterfeit pills with fentanyl. The addicted are unfamiliar with the substances they are taking, and in many cases, it’s too late.
Parents, teachers and educators have not been properly informed, and our nation’s leaders must step up.
I am fortunate to be involved in a nationwide campaign to educate the public in the “Not in Vein” heroin, fentanyl and opioid documentary. The producers of the film were inspired after hearing the tragic loss of 20-year-old Marin Riggs from Ohio.
Like Marin’s mother stated, “She’s now a pissed off mom.” Her words touched the film producers and others like me to step up and help with an aggressive awareness initiative. We feel Heidi Riggs’s pain and want to prevent more tragedy.
It’s obvious to me that many politicians have mislabeled the drug crisis as a prescription drug problem and an over-prescribing issue. There is plenty of blame to go around. Many politicians won’t blame the cartels for the deaths and do so deliberately for political reasons. It’s easier for them if they ignore the real cause.
Let’s be clear: In 2018, illicit drugs distributed by cartels are driving this crisis and the public needs to know the truth. According to research from the American Action Forum, in many parts of the country, prescription drug overdoses are down as illicit cartel drug overdoses are up.
Thanks to President Trump for addressing the crisis in Massachusetts and New Hampshire for what it is, a cartel invasion to spread their poison and make tons of money.
We need to use the brave personnel of ICE and remove these criminal aliens contributing to the destruction of our society. Now it’s time for Congress to provide real solutions. They need to provide the resources for better border security and must update the antiquated laws that no longer make sense.
Congress must secure the border to stem the tide of illegal drugs and brutal cartel activity.",1
2440,"Reuters","U.S. President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign on Saturday issued a new video ad calling Democrats “complicit” in murders committed by illegal immigrants, during a government shutdown partly triggered by an impasse over immigration. A traffic light shines red after President Donald Trump and the U.S. Congress failed to reach a deal on funding for federal agencies in Washington, U.S., January 20, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts
The Trump campaign released the ad, titled “Complicit,” on the anniversary of the Republican president’s inauguration. It focuses on an undocumented immigrant, Luis Bracamontes, charged in the 2014 killings of two police officers in Sacramento, California. The man’s lawyers had questioned his sanity but a judge found him mentally competent to stand trial, according to a report last week in the Sacramento Bee. “Democrats who stand in our way will be complicit in every murder committed by illegal immigrants,” the ad says. The new ad is likely to anger Democrats and immigration advocates and could inflame tensions over the issue on Capitol Hill, where Democrats and Republicans were working through the weekend to reach an agreement that would reopen the government. A news release announcing the ad blamed Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer for the shutdown, accusing him and Democrats of “holding lawful citizens hostage over their demands for amnesty for illegal immigrants.” Schumer’s spokesman said in an email, “This is a shameless attempt by the president to distract from the Trump shutdown. Rather than campaigning, he should do his job and negotiate a deal to open the government address the needs of the American people.” “It’s a campaign ad, which tend to be extreme, but this is completely divorced from reality and full of fear and hate,” said Melanie Nezer, vice president of the refugee agency HIAS. Trump filed for re-election the day he took office, an unusual move that has allowed him to begin campaigning long before the November 2020 election. Historically, incumbent presidents have waited two years, until after the midterm elections, to file formally. On Friday, most Senate Democrats opposed a bill that would have avoided the shutdown, because their efforts to include protections for hundreds of thousands of mostly young immigrants, known as Dreamers, were rejected by Trump and Republican leaders. The Dreamers were brought illegally into the United States as children, and given temporary legal status under a program started by former President Barack Obama.",0
1221,"WSJ","President Donald Trump has issued a series of controversial executive orders on immigration that are now tangled up in federal courts. Judges in Hawaii and Maryland have blocked the president’s ban on travelers from six mostly Muslim countries, and another judge in Seattle has blocked his executive order threatening to remove federal funding for “sanctuary cities” that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agents. If this contest between branches of government sounds familiar, it should. President Barack Obama also tried to use executive orders to push through his own very different immigration policies, and he was similarly rebuffed by the courts. They held that he lacked the unilateral authority to shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. There’s a lesson in the symmetry of these two examples, and figures from across the political and ideological spectrum are increasingly embracing it: Many of the issues that recent presidents have tried to decide at the national level through executive orders are best resolved at the state or local levels instead. In an era of fierce partisan divisions, all sides are beginning to see the virtues of our federal system in accommodating differences—and encouraging experimentation—on issues such as immigration, law enforcement and education. Federalism has long been a cause on the right, but now it’s just as likely to be a rallying cry on the left. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary’s immigration and border-security subcommittee, recently said: “The Constitution, specifically the Tenth Amendment, protects states’ rights, and it prohibits federal actions that commandeer state and local officials. When it comes to immigration, these principles seem to be overlooked.” The framers of the Constitution would be pleased with this emerging consensus. By creating a national government with limited powers, they intended to allow the states and local governments to pursue a range of different policies on matters within what used to be called their “police powers”—that is, their authority to regulate behavior, maintain order and promote the public good within their own territory. The founders considered this arrangement the best way to protect liberty and diversity of opinion, as well as to defend political minorities from nationalist tyranny and concentrated power. Of course, from the earliest days of the republic, the framers debated what form this division of powers would take. Alexander Hamilton famously urged the national government to assume more powers and to assert them aggressively against the states. Thomas Jefferson (and his close ally James Madison) resisted this centralizing impulse, pointing to the rights reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment and the limits on congressional power. This debate has defined the boundaries of constitutional argument since the Founding era, but it doesn’t map neatly onto partisan politics, then or now. Throughout American history, Hamiltonians and Jeffersonians have come in many forms, left and right, and they have often found broad areas of agreement on issues of federalism, if sometimes for different reasons. Consider, for example, the Supreme Court during the Progressive era. Under Chief Justice William Howard Taft, who served from 1921 to 1930, justices from across the ideological spectrum upheld limits on federal power. Justice Louis Brandeis, a proud Jeffersonian, famously praised the states as laboratories of democracy. As he wrote, “It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.” Chief Justice Taft himself was a convinced Hamiltonian and less sympathetic to limits on national power. But he too was a firm supporter of federalism. As he wrote in a 1922 essay, the diffusion of power between the national and state governments serves “to defend us all against the danger of sudden gusts of popular passion.” There might be a populist assault on property rights in Kansas—one of his examples—but the unhappy experiment there could instruct other states and the national government to make better choices. As he observed, “the diversity of opinion in State governments enforces a wise deliberation.” Today, as during the Progressive era and the long resistance of the South to national efforts to end segregation, the embrace of federalism and states’ rights can be opportunistic, even cynical. The current rediscovery of states’ rights on the left is driven, in some instances, by the election of Mr. Trump and the fact that Republicans now control both houses of Congress. The states are their last enclaves of resistance. For their part, conservatives often invoke the Constitution’s Tenth Amendment, which says that powers not given to the national government are “reserved to the States, or to the people,” but they haven’t been consistent defenders of federalism either. President Ronald Reagan issued an executive order on federalism in 1987, declaring that “in most areas of governmental concern, the States uniquely possess the constitutional authority, the resources, and the competence to discern the sentiments of the people and to govern accordingly.” But the size and reach of the federal government continued to grow during the Reagan era. As an advocacy group called the Tenth Amendment Center concludes, “Disappointingly, Reagan the president wasn’t nearly as devoted to federalism and the Constitution as was Reagan the rhetorician.” All postwar presidents have tended to amass federal power rather than to devolve it. And opposition parties have always defended states’ rights as a way of protecting dissent and their own policy agendas. At the same time, the courts have increasingly repudiated attempts by presidents—from George W. Bush and Barack Obama to Donald Trump—to use executive orders to implement policies that they can’t persuade Congress to enact. Today’s effort to revive federalism acknowledges and builds on these institutional and political realities. What does it mean in practice? Immigration is a good place to start, since at first glance it might seem like an obvious area of far-reaching federal control. But the Constitution’s grant to Congress of the power to establish a “uniform rule of naturalization” leaves a great deal of room for local variety. In a 2014 article in the journal Democracy, Cristina Rodriguez of Yale Law School argued that leaving key immigration decisions to the states needn’t be “scary” to progressives. Some border states might stress enforcement, she pointed out, but other states would be free to adopt more permissive policies. She pointed in particular to a bill signed in 2013 by Gov. Jerry Brown of California that constrained police in the state from cooperating with federal immigration agents. It is a precedent with particular force today, as California and other Democratic states have moved to resist the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Some conservatives also have favored a decentralized approach to immigration. In a partial dissent from a 2012 Supreme Court decision limiting Arizona’s power to control immigration enforcement, the late Antonin Scaliawrote that the ruling deprived states of “what most would consider the defining characteristic of sovereignty: the power to exclude from the sovereign’s territory people who have no right to be there.” The Supreme Court may revisit these issues in a series of pending constitutional disputes over immigration policy. Meanwhile, states have other options, which they have been exercising since well before the Trump administration. A 2014 article in National Journal by Andrew Wainer and Audrey Singer noted that the previous year had seen a 64% increase in proposed or enacted local and state laws on immigration. They pointed, for example, to a proposal by Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, a Republican, to attract 50,000 high-skilled immigrants to Detroit. A more expansive variation on this theme is now being promoted by Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, both Republicans. As they told an audience at the libertarian Cato Institute in early May, states should be able to hand out thousands of guest-worker visas to the recipients whom they consider most deserving. Policing is another area where federalism could have a salutary effect. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently upended a bipartisan consensus, embraced by significant constituencies on the right and the left, by ordering federal prosecutors to pursue the toughest possible sentences even for low-level drug crimes. Though this effort is limited to federal offenses, it may well hurt ongoing experimentation at the local and state level to find policies better suited to the circumstances of particular parts of the country. Mr. Sessions also recently announced that the federal government will back away from the Obama administration’s strategy, in response to rising racial tensions, of monitoring troubled police departments. He warned that “the greatest increase in violence and murders” has been in areas where federal policy has undermined “respect for our police and made, oftentimes, their job more difficult.” Although Mr. Session’s claims about rising violence are contested, this withdrawal of federal oversight could help to shape a new consensus that police departments need the autonomy to build trust in their own communities while also being held to rigorous standards of accountability by local and state authorities, who are no less responsible than federal officials for upholding constitutional guarantees. Less federal interference in policing may lead to better policy in the long run. Policing has always been a state rather than a federal responsibility, and the most innovative new strategies in law enforcement have come from localities dealing with practical problems on the ground. The next wave of reforms—on issues like eyewitness investigation and the videotaping of police encounters with citizens—will emerge from the many different ways in which police departments and city and state legislatures try to strike the right balance between privacy and public safety. Or consider education, another area traditionally left to the states. Here the Trump administration has struck a blow for federalism by launching a review of Obama-era regulations and guidance for school districts. The executive order directs Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to modify or repeal measures that she considers to be federal overreach. “For too long, the government has imposed its will on state and local governments. The result has been education that spends more and achieves far, far, far less,” Mr. Trump said in announcing the order. Trump critics such as former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida have been pleased. As he wrote in OutletName, “The state laboratories of government should have ample chance to innovate with scores of new ideas and policies to spark economic growth and improve education to lift people out of poverty and lift up the middle class.” These moves away from federally imposed priorities also have won the support of liberals in recent years. These moves away from federally imposed priorities also have won the support of liberals in recent years. During the Obama administration, California’s Gov. Brown, for example, was a strong critic of national testing standards, telling a group of technology leaders in 2013 that they were “just a form of national control.” A more controversial aspect of education policy is the recent debate over bathroom policies for transgender students. In this area, there is vigorous disagreement about how to read the federal civil-rights law. Neither Mr. Obama nor Mr. Trump has been able to get Congress to address the issue, and both tried to do so through executive action. The Supreme Court may ultimately decide whether federal law supports one side or the other. Meanwhile, assuming that Congress continues to ignore the issue, it will percolate at the local and state level, as it should. It’s hard to know what form the new dispensation on federalism might take in the years ahead, especially if the Supreme Court returns more prerogatives to the states. But a preview of sorts can be seen in a recent online discussion sponsored by the National Constitution Center (which I direct). For the libertarian legal scholar Randy Barnett of Georgetown University, a principled return to federalism offers the possibility of “keeping social issues local” and avoiding “a war of all against all.” As he observes, “A rich diversity of preferred lifestyles can only be achieved at the local level.” Elevating such issues to the national level is a recipe for “more contentiousness, bitterness, and ‘gridlock.’ ” For her part, Heather Gerken of Yale Law School, the leading advocate of “progressive federalism,” argues that in contested areas ranging from health care to the environment, the states and federal government govern best when operating shoulder-to-shoulder. “Take a look at telecom, the AFDC [antipoverty program], Medicaid, drug enforcement, workplace safety, health care, immigration, even national security law,” she writes. “In these integrated regulatory regimes, the states and federal government have forged vibrant, interactive relationships that involve both cooperation and conflict.” A respect for federalism and state autonomy is perhaps the only way that all sides can peacefully coexist in today’s political environment. With dysfunction now reigning on Capitol Hill and federal courts increasingly ready to strike down the unilateral action of presidents, Americans will at least be able to take some comfort in local autonomy and control. In these polarized times, citizens who strongly disagree with each other may be able to unite around the goal of making federal power less intrusive and national politics less of a contest where the winner takes all.",0
111,"FoxNews","As Washington, D.C. debates whether or not a wall will stop the flow of illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States, one Arizona county sheriff says it led to a dramatic 91 percent reduction in crime.
“The fence worked here. It may not work in New Mexico, I can only talk about my area. But [politicians should] defer to the Border Patrol experts,” Yuma County Sheriff Leon Wilmot told OutletName. “They know the situation.”
In 2006, President George W. Bush passed the Secure Fence Act which had a tremendous impact in Yuma County. In 2015, OutletName reported a 96 percent reduction in apprehensions due to a 20-foot tall steel fence and manpower being tripled. Wilmot was a deputy during that time but saw the impact firsthand.
“It was a 91 percent drop,” Wilmot said. “It obviously helped us curb some of the criminal activity that we unfortunately had to deal with.”
The 91 percent reduction in crime Wilmot cites is a Sheriffs office number. According to Wilmot, service calls and arrests dropped dramatically between 2005-2009 leading to the conclusion that added fencing along with more manpower had a major impact on local crime. According to Wilmot this number also includes immigration-related arrests and apprehensions that Sheriff's deputies would have made and crimes committed against smuggling victims.
“When they were no longer able to take advantage of our border as a smuggler’s paradise, the crimes against those being smuggled virtually stopped,” Wilmot said.
Data from the U.S. Border Patrol also shows that since 2005, total illegal alien apprehensions dropped from 138,438 to 12,847 in 2017. It was as low 5,833 in 2011.
The “wall” the president wants has been a bone of contention between Democrats and Republicans. Wilmot, however, believes it is an important part of fixing the border.
“When it comes to border security you need all of it,” said Wilmot. “You can fence up a house but you need everything else to make it secure.”
“For [Yuma County] we needed it to stop the criminal element.”
In a recent interview with the Epoch Times, Wilmot talked about utilizing fencing to cut border crime in the area by 91 percent and the Obama administration’s impact on the area.
During his interview with OutletNameNews.com, he was more focused on other deterrents to stopping immigrants from taking the dangerous trek to through his area and other border areas.
“Why is the U.S. attorney's office not prosecuting these parents?” Wilmot said. “These children are being pushed under razor wire, canal water. That’s not being a parent. We found a five or six-year-old the other day with pneumonia because his parents didn’t properly take care of him.”
According to Wilmot, the Border Patrol in his area currently has 160 immigrant children in their custody.
ICE: NO CONTACT WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ACCUSED OF KILLING CALIFORNIA COP BEFORE MURDER
“We don’t have enough time determine if the [adults] they are with have custody,” Wilmot said.
Law enforcement leaders like Wilmot are becoming more vocal when it comes to immigration and letting everyone know what works and what is needed.
Wilmot believes Washington isn’t trying to be part of the solution.
“They need to get their heads out of the sand. They need to get to work,” Wilmot told OutletNameNews.com. “Law enforcement is working, they’re not even getting paid. They can’t agree on a budget?”

Wilmot’s county borders 126 miles with Mexico and while he does believe President Donald Trump is helping by forcing Congress to deal with illegal immigration and its impact, he still feels like there is more to be done by both parties and believes the issue shouldn’t be political.
“Our border patrol partners are overwhelmed,” said Wilmot. “I don’t care who was elected.”
In October the Western States Sheriffs Association released a statement on the immigration crisis saying that it was at a “critical juncture.”
“The vast majority of our citizens are truly frustrated, and disappointed with our national leadership. It is past time that our elected national leaders put aside their partisan positions and focus on what is best for our nation, while maintaining the rights of all people in our country,” the statement read.",1
2671,"Reuters","U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Monday welcomed news that U.S. senators voted to move forward on funding legislation that would reopen the federal government, blaming Democrats for the shutdown but saying they had failed.
In Washington, the Senate ended a three-day standoff between Democrats and President Donald Trump’s Republicans over immigration and border security by voting on a deal that would fund the government until Feb. 8.
“We welcome the news that thanks to the firm stand taken by President Trump and House and Senate Republicans, the government shutdown in Washington, D.C., is coming to an end,” Pence said in a statement to reporters before a dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
He said looked forward to returning from Jerusalem, where he has been on an official visit, to Washington to get back to work after the shutdown has ended.
“The Schumer shutdown failed,” he said, referring to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.
Democrats had held back support for funding originally because they wanted guarantees on an immigration debate, specifically about the fate of children brought to the United States by undocumented immigrants.

698,"Daily Caller","House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California spoke out about his office being vandalized on “OutletName & Friends” Wednesday, then said it’s time to build a border wall.
McCarthy said vandals were caught on camera throwing a boulder through his California office window Saturday. The suspects are still at large. McCarthy sent out an Instagram post Tuesday asking for additional help with identifying the individuals.
“I don’t know why they did it or who did it. We just have the pictures from our own cameras of these two individuals. So I put it out on my own personal Facebook page trying to see if anybody knew who they were,” he told “OutletName & Friends.”
“They threw this — it’s a massive rock to throw through the window, and I don’t think one person could have thrown it by themselves. And then they entered the office — this was Saturday night at 9:54. And they stole some computer equipment and ran back out, got in a truck and took off. So we don’t know the motives. We don’t know why they did it, but I’d like to find out who they are and get our equipment back,” McCarthy continued.
He then switched gears to immigration and said he wants to lead the effort in the House to fully fund a border wall and finally start enforcing federal statutes.
“Well the bill is very simple. Build the wall, enforce the law,” McCarthy said. “Not only does it have the funding in there to build the wall … it actually enhances our ability to remove the MS-13 gang members. It ends sanctuary cities. It has ‘Kate’s Law.'”
He said fear of the approaching caravan of illegal immigrants is justified, but claimed he’s even more concerned with what will happen if Democrats win in November.

2248,"USA Today","US President Donald Trump describes his travel ban as ""common sense"" as a US appeals court is set to hold a hearing on the constitutionality of the executive order. Three federal appeals court judges voiced deep skepticism Tuesday about President Trump's temporary ban on immigration from seven majority-Muslim nations, an indication that they are not inclined to reinstate it.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit panel pounced on the Justice Department lawyer representing the administration for insisting the travel ban was needed despite existing visa rules and restrictions.
The panel – two judges appointed by Democratic presidents, one by a Republican – expressed some sympathy for the government's fallback position that lawful permanent residents from the seven nations could be excluded from the ban. But the judges questioned whether they or administration officials could rewrite Trump's order on the fly.
Judge Richard Clifton, who was named to the bench by President George W. Bush, voiced the most support for a potential compromise. The others — Judges Michelle Friedland, named by President Barack Obama, and William Canby, appointed by President Jimmy Carter — were more harsh in their appraisals of the ban.
The unusual hearing, with a live nationwide audience listening in, dealt with the most significant test of Trump's fledgling administration — one that pits the president's authority to protect the nation against the rights of legal immigrants and refugees. A spokesman for the court said a ruling is expected later this week.
It was convened only days after Trump signed the executive order, which places its most extreme restrictions on refugees and immigrants from Syria. The order was blocked last week by federal district Judge James Robart in Seattle. He would hear detailed arguments from both sides if the appeals court panel upholds his initial decision and sends the case back. And either side could appeal the panel's ruling to the Supreme Court.August Flentje, arguing for the government, said the seven countries selected for the travel ban, which are Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, were identified by the Obama administration as prone to terror, giving Trump the right to ban immigrants temporarily.
“Has the government provided any evidence connecting these countries with terrorism?” Friedland, the presiding judge, asked.
""I understand the concept of that, but it’s pretty abstract,"" Clifton chimed in. ""It’s not like there haven’t been processes in place for dealing with people from those countries.""
The judges zeroed in on that point, repeatedly asking for instances in which travelers from the seven countries had entered the U.S. and committed acts of terrorism. Flentje said the case was moving very quickly, pleading for more time to bolster the government's arguments at the district court level.
Washington state Solicitor General Noah Purcell raised the religious component of Trump's ban, arguing that it violated constitutional protections by barring targeting Muslims, who make up 97% of the seven nations' populations.
Clifton said he saw no evidence that the order was written to target Muslims and said the countries represent only about 15% of the world's Muslims. ""I have trouble understanding why we’re supposed to infer religious animus, when in fact the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected,"" he said.
Purcell responded that Trump's words on the campaign trail, when he called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country, were all the proof needed to understand the true reason behind the order. ""There are statements that we’ve quoted in our complaint that are rather shocking evidence of intent to discriminate against Muslims,"" he said.
To reverse Robart's ruling, the circuit court must show that it was decided in error, a difficult standard to meet — or at least that it was, as the government argues, ""vastly overbroad.""
If the panel keeps Trump's order on hold, the last stop could be the Supreme Court. With Trump's nominee to fill the vacant ninth seat, Neil Gorsuch, just beginning a lengthy confirmation process, the high court could decide not to hear the president's appeal or emerge with a 4-4 tie that would keep the lower court's ruling in place.
Legal experts said that sets up a difficult path for Trump's Department of Justice as it tries to overturn the temporary restraining order put in place last Friday and restart the immigration ban.
""The history of these challenges to presidential actions on immigration has been a pretty sharp partisan split,"" said Stephen Legomsky, professor emeritus at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis and a former chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. ""I wouldn't be surprised to see the 9th Circuit uphold the (temporary restraining order). And in the Supreme Court, I can easily imagine a 4-4 split.""
The partisan makeup of the appeals court, however, is far from a guarantee. Kari Hong, an assistant professor at Boston College Law School who has argued more than 100 cases at 9th Circuit, said the judges who will rule on Trump's order are not likely to rule based on party lines.
Judge William Canby was appointed by Carter, but he is a former lieutenant in the Air Force's JAG Corps, so he could be swayed by Trump's national security arguments. And while Judge Michelle Friedland was appointed by Obama, she clerked for Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was named to the court by President Ronald Reagan. Hong said that means Friedland ""studied at the foot of a jurist very concerned about process and procedure.""
""I don't think this is a foregone conclusion at all,"" Hong said.At issue is Trump’s Jan. 27 order that banned refugees from entering the U.S. for 120 days and barred immigration from Syria indefinitely. Trump said the ban was needed to give his intelligence agencies time to implement ""extreme vetting"" procedures for people coming from those terror-prone countries.
That order unleashed chaos around the world, as foreigners with visas and green cards were detained at U.S. airports and prohibited from boarding U.S.-bound flights. After Robart blocked the action pending further legal arguments, the State and Homeland Security departments reissued more than 60,000 visas that had been revoked.",0

“I just want to let you know that the Trump administration is with you folks 100 percent,” he said. “You have not been backed up properly, and everybody knows it. For political reasons, for lots of different reasons. But the Trump administration is with you.”
Nielsen agreed that a wall would be built, but specified that the money requested by his administration would be used to provide more border technology and agents.
“We’re going to build you one,” she said, referring to the wall funding request of $25 billion. “We have a very specific and targeted way in which we will use that money to build a border wall system. Just not just that infrastructure, but the technology and personnel that go with it.”
Nielsen even brought graphics to the briefing, showing Trump how border walls work.
“We’ve seen it, we have evidence, we know that they work,” she said.
Trump again cited the four principals of his immigration reform framework, which includes securing the border, closing loopholes, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery.
ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan, who was also at the briefing, thanked Trump for visiting the facility and empowering his agents.
“For the American heroes sitting behind you, we thank you for letting us do our job,” he said.
He informed the president that since he took office, border crossings were at a 45-year low.
“That just shows you that when we’re allowed to enforce law, we’re going to have an impact,” he said.
Trump said lightly that it was a “great number” but that he was still “very unhappy” about it.
“That’s impressive nevertheless,” he said, as the agents laughed. “But you’ll do much better, good luck.”",1
2450,"Reuters","The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit challenging what it calls a pattern by President Donald Trump’s administration of detaining illegal immigrants seeking to legalize their status based on marriages to U.S. citizens. The proposed class action was filed late on Tuesday in federal court in Boston and alleges that immigration officials have been illegally separating families while a noncitizen spouse was seeking lawful immigration status. “These actions are not only inhumane but they are unlawful,” Adriana Lafaille, a lawyer with the ACLU of Massachusetts, said at a press conference. The lawsuit came amid calls by the Republican president for the U.S. Congress to stop legal immigrants from sponsoring extended family members who want to move to the United States through what he has characterized as “chain migration.” The lawsuit centers on regulations the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) enacted during former Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration aimed at encouraging people living illegally in the country to seek lawful status. Under regulations enacted in 2016, undocumented spouses of U.S. citizens could go through a process to seek waivers that would allow them to largely remain in the United States rather than leave the county while pursuing permanent residency. But the lawsuit said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been detaining people who were going through that process and in January alone arrested seven people while they were at a Massachusetts or Rhode Island USCIS office. The complaint contended the administration’s actions stemmed from a “racial animus and animus based on national origin,” noting that Trump during his election campaign referred to Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. The lawsuit contends the administration’s actions violate the Immigration and Nationality Act and are unconstitutional, and seeks an injunction to prevent further similar detentions. John Mohan, a spokesman for ICE, declined to comment. The class action claims were added to an earlier case centered on Lilian Calderon, a Guatemalan immigrant who was arrested at a government office in Rhode Island in January after an interview that was part of the process to seek legal status. Calderon, who was brought to the United States when she was 3 years old in 1991, was detained for about a month and was only released after the lawsuit was filed. She said her two children now have nightmares due to her abrupt arrest. “I’m not the only one who was detained that has family that was going to their interview,” she told reporters.",0
729,"Daily Caller","Well over half of young Republican voters think illegal immigrants should be offered a path to U.S. citizenship if they meet “certain conditions,” according to a new poll from the Public Religion Research Institute.
The PRRI’s American Values Atlas found that Republicans in the 18 to 29 age cohort have a significantly more liberal outlook than their older counterparts on the citizenship question, reflecting generational differences found across the American electorate regardless of party affiliation.
Among all Republicans, support for a path to citizenship stands at about 55 percent. When only Republicans between the ages of 18 to 29 are surveyed, that figure rises to 62 percent.
Young Republicans also take a softer line than older generations on other immigration-related questions, according to the PRRI poll.
When asked about discrimination against immigrants in the U.S., 41 percent of Republicans of all ages say immigrants face discrimination “a lot,” but the figure jumps to 60 percent among the youngest cohort of Republican voters. In contrast, only about a third of GOP voters 65 and older think immigrants experience discrimination.
Among all Americans, 63 percent say there’s a lot of discrimination against immigrants, but GOP voters between the ages of 18 and 29 are the only subgroup of Republicans in which a majority of respondents agree with that assertion.
The split between young and old Republicans on immigration questions is in keeping with a more permissive attitude among younger generations about a range of issues including gay marriage and multiculturalism, according to PRRI surveys. Many young Republicans believe increased diversity is a net benefit to the U.S.
Ryan Kromsky, a former University of Maryland student and co-founder of the school’s Progressive College Republicans, believes immigrants should be welcomed with “open arms” because they are “hard workers, bright students and aspiring capitalists.”
“Closed-minded Republicans need to expand their perspective to see how immigrants are helping us all create a better America,” the 24-year-old financial systems analyst told the Associated Press. “I believe that this will change with the younger generation of Republicans.”
The American Values Atlas poll results come from 40,509 interviews conducted by telephone, including 24,266 interviews via mobile phones, between May 18, 2016, and January 10, 2017. The margin of error is plus or minus 0.6 percentage points.",1
56,"FoxNews","Valerie and her son took a walk around this city’s downtown area on Monday after spending three months on a treacherous trek from Brazil, through Central America to Texas. Valerie, a Congolese woman, fled her war-torn country with her family and is now trying to create a new life here. “We left the Congo because there weren’t any resources for us…my son has really liked it here. I’ve liked it here, as well. It’s for this reason I’ve come here to figure out my life, to improve my life,” she said in French. 
Valerie is one of hundreds of African migrants who arrived in San Antonio last week. City leaders said they weren’t given a heads up and quickly scrambled to accommodate them and quickly recruit several French-speaking volunteers who could serve as translators. “The City of San Antonio has received more than 200 individuals, mostly families and children. The families were released by the United States Customs and Border Patrol into the country with paperwork directing them to Portland, Maine,” said Interim Assistant City Manager Dr. Colleen Bridger. The majority of them stayed at Travis Park Church, which regularly hosts asylum seekers. “I’m not necessarily surprised…we react to changes on the border every day, we just had to figure out that process it didn't really shake us up too much,” said Gavin Rogers, associate pastor. It's not just Congolese migrants arriving in alarming numbers. Border Patrol agents reported arresting more than 500 people from Africa since May 30. The group included nationals from Angola, Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While Border Patrol has previously seen migrants from Africa, this is the first time they have seen such a large group crossing together. “It really has been a bit of an anomaly for us,” said Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. “I think most of them, you know, obviously are flying to different locations. And then, when they find themselves congregating in a location then they start to formulate a plan just south of the U.S. Mexican border here."" For years, people from the Congo and neighboring countries have fled to escape political instability and violence. According to the UN Refugee Agency, 4.5 million people from the DRC have been displaced. But the numbers seem to be increasing and officials in border towns are struggling to keep up. “Some [refugees] may have been traveling for months to get to the Mexico border in search of better opportunities that the U.S. has to offer, the human rights that the U.S. has to offer,” Bonita Sharma, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio’s College of Public Policy, told The Rivard Report. Unlike most Mexicans and Central Americans, many of the migrants from Africa don't have roots in America or families who can take them in once they are released from immigration detention. And many speak languages the immigration officials do not. “Quite often, the individuals from the African continent do not have a permanent address or a sponsor already in the U.S. And so you really just have to pinpoint an immigration court near where they think they are going to ultimately end up and hope that they report themselves in,” said Ortiz. Over the weekend, the city, along with Catholic Charities, worked with the asylum seekers to figure out their next destination as many arrived without designated host families and cities. “If we don't know exactly the best place to send the migrant community like the Congolese. We have to figure out what shelters are available around the nation, where's the best place for their community to go,” said Rogers. There was also concern that some of the migrants could carry diseases, as there is currently an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, Bridger quickly shut down those rumors, telling local reporters that the migrants go through multiple health screenings. ""It's a 21-day incubation period so it's really not possible that, if they were exposed to Ebola in the DRC, that now, six months later, they develop symptoms and infect us,"" Bridger said. By Monday, the majority of the migrants had left on buses, heading to cities where they may have friends or family members. The line outside the city’s Migrant Resource Center downtown had dwindled. But, if more come, Rogers said they’ll be ready. “We’re a church always willing to serve our neighbors,"" Rogers said. ""We'll continue to do so whether that's with migrants or the homeless or a new need that will crop up in the future.”",1
492,"Breitbart","Angel Mom Mary Ann Mendoza says Americans who have been victimized by illegal aliens are living proof that United States needs a wall along the southern border to stop illegal immigration.
On Friday, President Trump announced he would reopen the federal government by signing a three-week funding bill that does not include money for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Mendoza — who co-founded Angel Families after her 32-year-old son Brandon Mendoza was killed by a drunk illegal alien who was driving the wrong way down a highway in Mesa, Arizona — told OutletName News in an exclusive statement that it is Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) who are “holding Americans hostage” by refusing to support any measures to curb mass illegal immigration.
“Angel Families, Border Patrol, DHS, ranchers and all other citizens affected by illegal alien crime are the proof [Pelosi and Schumer] need,” Mendoza said.
The latest polling from Harvard/Harris finds that more than 80 percent of American voters either strongly or somewhat support a crackdown on illegal alien crime, including 96 percent of Republicans, 70 percent of Democrats, and 79 percent of swing voters.
 guess who’s credit rating is NON EXISTENT? EVERY AMERICAN CITIZEN KILLED BY AN ILLEGAL ALIEN IN OUR COUNTRY….4000+ annually lose their lives and credit rating. They are DEAD because of NO BORDER SECURITY! BRANDON ‘S LIFE MATTERS pic.twitter.com/9k90lcc6cl — ❌Angel Mom Mary Ann Mendoza ⭐️⭐️⭐️ () January 24, 2019
“If hundreds of thousands of American citizens affected annually by illegal alien crime isn’t enough to make every man, woman, and young adult take notice and listen to what could happen to any of them in the blink of an eye — and make our elected officials stand up and protect us over illegal aliens illegally present in our country — I don’t know what else to do,” Mendoza continued.
Mendoza said the president’s plan to form a negotiating committee to strike a deal that he hopes will at least partially fund construction of a border wall will reveal, starkly, who elected Democrats represent.
“Denial is not the answer,” Mendoza said. “Step up and acknowledge our hardships, loss, and lack of protection. If Democrats refuse to negotiate during this temporary fix, Americans will now know for certain who they fight fo, and it isn’t you and I.”
Illegal immigration at the southern border, for December 2018, has increased 81 percent compared to this same month the year before. Additionally, there were about 22,000 illegal alien minors who crossed the southern border last month.
Meanwhile, drug overdoses in 2017 killed an unprecedented 72,287 U.S. residents, nearly three times the number of individuals killed by global terrorism. Nearly 50,000 of those deadly overdoses were caused by either heroin or fentanyl.
Last year, alone, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency arrested nearly 2,000 convicted and suspected illegal alien killers, leaving behind countless American and legal immigrant victims.

420,"Breitbart","President Donald Trump singled out border patrol agents’ representatives Chris Crane and Brandon Judd for praise during a policy speech Wednesday, thanking them for their service and promising they will be allowed to carry out their jobs under his administration.
“We are going to restore the rule of law in the United States. Before we go any further, I want to recognize the ICE and border patrol officers in this room today, and to honor their service, and not just because they unanimously endorsed me for president,” Trump said.
“That helps! But that’s not the only reason,” he joked. “I also want to acknowledge two individuals in the audience who will play a very, very important role going forward. I’d like to recognize Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, and Chris Crane… the president of the National ICE Council. You guys are about to be very, very busy doing your jobs they want you want to do them.”
Trump pointed them out in the audience to applause and thanked them.
The National ICE Council, which represents thousands of ICE agents, endorsed Trump ahead of the first presidential debate—the first time the Council ever endorsed any candidate for public office.
“America has been lied to about every aspect of immigration in the United States,” Crane said when announcing the endorsement. “We can fix our broken immigration system, and we can do it in a way that honors America’s legacy as a land of immigrants, but Donald Trump is the only candidate who is willing to put politics aside so that we can achieve that goal. We hereby endorse Donald J. Trump, and urge all Americans, especially the millions of lawful immigrants living within our country, to support Donald J. Trump, and to protect American jobs, wages and lives.”
Crane himself worked tirelessly during the presidential campaign to protest the handcuffing of ICE officers the Obama administration looked the other way while massive surges of illegal immigration flowed into the country. Ignored by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration, Crane found in Trump a candidate who wholeheartedly supported law enforcement. Trump went out of his way to organize a meeting with Crane and other ICE officers and invited Crane to appear at a campaign rally with him.
“This is not the person that you frequently see on TV. He was very welcoming, very sincere. He really wanted to hear from boots on the ground, officers out in the field about what’s happening,” Crane said. “There’s no two ways about it—he was definitely more informed on the issues than a lot of members of Congress that I’ve met with in my lifetime.”
Judd had also appeared with Trump during a OutletName town hall, saying, “We have to end the catch-and-release program. You’ve got to get rid of that magic magnet that is bringing these people over here.” The National Border Patrol Council, which represents over 17,000 border patrol agents, likewise endorsed Trump in a bold statement in March. “Mr. Trump is as bold and outspoken as other world leaders who put their country’s interests ahead of all else,” they stated. “Our current political establishment has bled this country dry, sees their power evaporating, and isn’t listening to voters who do all the heavy lifting. Trump is opposed by the established powers specifically because they know he is the only candidate who actually threatens the established powers that have betrayed this country.”
Trump and his campaign maintained that immigration enforcement policies will be determined by the men and women doing the dangerous hard work of securing U.S. borders, not by bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.

2227,"USA Today","A native of Iran, Arina Yaghoubi, has battled leukemia since she was 14.
While her disease was in remission, she left home to enter James Madison University in Virginia, only to have the disease return.
Yaghoubi, 21, has been successfully treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, with her mother by her side for the last nine months and is now cancer free.
But with the ban President Trump has placed on immigrants from certain Middle Eastern countries, her mother is afraid to go home and her father can't enter the United States. With so much uncertainty, Yaghoubi is afraid that she might not be allowed to stay in this country to continue her studies.
Late Saturday, a federal judge in New York granted a stay on deportations of those detained on entry to the United States. But no one knows if the stay will hold, or how long it will last, so the uncertainty remains.
""I just don’t know what my status is going to be or where I’m going to end up. Is the United States going to be welcoming to me once more or politely ask me to leave?"" she said. ""I'm scared about my future.""
Trump signed on Friday an executive order that banned visitors from seven Middle Eastern countries — Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Sudan and Syria — from coming to the United States for 90 days. The executive order signed Friday also suspended for 120 days all refugees coming to the United States.
Yaghoubi's father has obtained a visa to come to this country, but won't be able to use it. And with the uncertainties of her health and the fluid U.S. immigration policy, Yaghoubi's mother is reluctant to go home.
""I could be fine for rest of my life. But, if something comes up, my parents just want to be able to be with me,"" Yaghoubi said. ""They just want to make sure they have a backup plan. The backup plan was great but it's not really practical anymore.""
St. Jude officials could not comment on Yaghoubi's particular situation, but in a statement said, ""This is new so we are still working to understand its implications for our patients and families. It's not appropriate to speak about any particular patients at this point. But I can tell you that we are committed to helping our patients and their families as they experience life-threatening diseases. Our mission is to find cures and save children's lives, and we understand how critical families are in that process.""
Yaghoubi is a freshman at James Madison and plans to become a pharmacist.
Her mother has been away from her job as an accounting manager at an electric company for nearly a year. She's also been away from her husband and Yaghoubi's 18-year-old brother.
Yaghoubi's father is a civil engineer and owns his company, making it easier for him to come to the United States if he's needed and if he's allowed in.
""I’m just scared and really frustrated,"" she said.
The doctors at St. Jude have been wonderful, she said, but treating leukemia is hard.
She had her first bone-marrow transplant in 2010.
""The disease knocks you down and the medication knocks you down all over again,"" she said. ""You can't even walk. You can't even breathe the way you want to.""
Because the disease kept her away from school, Yaghoubi can't wait to get back to James Madison.
But her student visa was converted to a medical visa and there's no guarantee, in this current political climate, if she can get her student visa back.
""With all the things I’m seeing right now, I just don't know if it's a possibility for me anymore,"" she said. ""I don’t know if I’m going to be allowed to stay in the United States. I'm just not sure about it at all."" ",0
233,"FoxNews","A third person living in the United States under an Obama-era protection for illegal immigrants who entered the country as minors was arrested this week for allegedly trying to smuggle Mexican nationals into the U.S.
U.S. Border Patrol said agents in Arizona nabbed the 26-year-old man, who is a Mexican national and a beneficiary of the 2012 Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals executive order, after spotting footprints from four people who had crossed the border near the Colorado River on Monday.
Officials said they soon discovered the four people getting into a white Ford F-150 in a nearby citrus grove.
The vehicle was pulled over and the driver, who now lives in Salinas, Calif., was identified as a DACA recipient, authorities said. The four other occupants were identified as Mexican nationals who were in the U.S. illegally.
Border Patrol said the unidentified driver was arrested on human smuggling charges while the four passengers were arrested for immigration violations. The vehicle was seized for forfeiture.
Monday's incident was at least the third human smuggling-related arrest this week in which agents nabbed a so-called ""Dreamer.""
Border Patrol officials said two Dreamers -- one in the country legally under the DACA program and the other whose permission had expired -- were arrested last week in separate incidents in California.
One arrest occurred last Wednesday near Torrey Pines State Beach while the other happened in Campo, Calif. Both suspects are in custody. Officials did not indicate the three men were linked to each other in any way.

546,"Breitbart","The “Gang of Six” amnesty for millions of illegal aliens shielded from deportation by the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program should be rolled “straight into the trash can,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) says.
On Wednesday, a group of six pro-amnesty Senators will roll out their expansive immigration amnesty plan that would not only give a pathway to U.S. citizenship beginning with 3.5 million DACA and DACA-eligible illegal aliens but also give amnesty to the parents of amnesty beneficiaries.
Cotton — whose popular legal immigration-cutting RAISE Act was endorsed by President Trump in 2017 — slammed the “Gang of Six” amnesty, saying it was dead on arrival.
Might as well roll it straight into the trash can … mass amnesty far beyond DACA, fake border security, no end to chain migration. ://t.co/pkpCrJxXfa — Tom Cotton () January 17, 2018
A memo on the expansive amnesty plan reveals that the legislation would:
Give DACA and DACA-eligible illegal aliens a pathway to U.S. citizenship
Give amnesty to the parents of DACA illegal aliens
Make no cuts to legal immigration levels, whereby more than one million legal immigrants enter the U.S. every year
Transfers the 50,000 visas through the Diversity Visa Lottery into two other visa categories
Does not fund the estimated $18 billion U.S.-Mexico border wall
Does not mandate E-Verify to bar employers from hiring illegal aliens over American workers
Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Jessica Vaughan wrote in an op-ed that the “Gang of Six” amnesty plan is “not a serious effort to find common ground with either the majority of congressional Republicans or the president,” as it does not meet the pro-American immigration reform requirements that have been laid out by the Trump administration.
A DACA amnesty is likely to trigger a border surge of potentially one million illegal aliens trying to cross the southern border into the U.S., as OutletName News reported.
As the Migration Policy Institute has chronicled, previous border surges from amnesty programs have brought hundreds of thousands across the U.S.-Mexico border:
While the flow of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) has been climbing steadily since 2012, a dramatic surge has taken place in the last six months, with the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas as the principal place of entry. The Border Patrol there has converted entire stations to house unaccompanied minors and families. According to the Border Patrol, apprehensions of unaccompanied children increased from 16,067 in fiscal year (FY) 2011 to 24,481 in FY 2012 and 38,833 in FY 2013. During the first eight months of FY 2014, 47,017 such children were apprehended by the Border Patrol. If the influx continues apace—and it shows no signs of slowing—the administration predicts that by the end of the fiscal year on September 30, totals could reach 90,000. Ninety-eight percent of unaccompanied minors currently arriving at the border are from Honduras (28 percent), Mexico (25 percent), Guatemala (24 percent), and El Salvador (21 percent). This breakdown represents a significant shift: prior to 2012, more than 75 percent of UACs were from Mexico.
As OutletName News reported, should the current legal immigration system not be changed over the next 50 years, the U.S. is on track to add 100 million foreign-born individuals to the country. In the next 20 years, the current legal immigration system is on track to import 15 million new foreign-born voters to the U.S.",1
2154,"USA Today","Bipartisan Senate negotiators have come to terms on a deal to protect ""DREAMers,"" as young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children are known. But the White House is not on board with the plan yet.
The senators, including Arizona Republican Jeff Flake, plan to introduce legislation Wednesday that would provide $18 billion in border-security enhancements over the next decade — including an immediate $1.6 billion down payment on President Trump's border wall.
In exchange, DREAMers would be granted permanent legal status.
The compromise would put them on a 12-year path to citizenship with up to two years credit for time spent with temporary deportation protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which the Trump administration is attempting to phase out on March 5.
Flake's bipartisan working group has been trying to hammer out a compromise for weeks.
On Tuesday, several hundred dreamers converged on Capitol Hill to demand that senators pass a bill by Friday, the deadline for Congress to adopt a spending resolution to avoid a partial government shutdown.
White House: Border-security funding lacking
The chances of an immigration bill passing this week appeared to slip away, however, after Trump rejected an earlier version last week and ignited an international firestorm by reportedly using vulgar language to question why, under the proposal, the U.S. would continue to accept immigrants from Haiti and African countries.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Tuesday that the earlier version of the Senate immigration proposal failed to include enough money for border security.
""Specifically, one of the areas that really, really fell short was the funding for border security,"" Sanders said. ""They only put in about one-tenth of what the Department of Homeland Security said they needed — not what they said they wanted, but what they said they needed. And this was simply a complete failure in terms of a good deal, based on what the president had laid out and based on what he wanted to see in a piece of legislation.""
The White House was continuing to work on an immigration bill with Republicans and Democrats in both the GOP-controlled House and Senate, she said. But she blamed Democrats for refusing to compromise on areas such as border security and so-called ""chain migration.""
Trump on Sunday tweeted: ""DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.""
Democrats are under pressure from immigrant advocates and progressives to withhold votes on the must-pass spending measure unless Republicans agree to Dream Act legislation that would give about 2 million dreamers a pathway to citizenship, including the 800,000 who received deportation protections under the Obama-era DACA program, as well as many of those who were eligible for it but didn't apply.
On Saturday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that current DACA recipients can again apply for two-year renewals after a federal judge in San Francisco temporarily blocked the Trump administration from phasing out the program.

What the bipartisan deal would do
According to highlights of the draft legislation obtained by The Arizona Republic, the compromise deal calls for a shift away from the nation's longstanding family-based immigration system by eliminating the Diversity Visa Lottery program, which uses a random lottery system to pick immigrants from countries with low rates of immigration to the U.S.
Half of the roughly 55,000 diversity-lottery visas now allocated annually would be reallocated based on new merit-based preferences to immigrants from ""priority countries"" that are underrepresented, according to highlights.
The remaining half would be reallocated over time to immigrants who had been allowed to remain in the U.S. under temporary protected status. They will maintain legal status and work authorization. The Trump administration recently ended temporary protected status for tens of thousands of immigrants with long ties to the U.S. from El Salvador, Haiti, Sudan and Nicaragua.
Once all of the temporary protected status backlogs are cleared, visas would be allocated to immigrants from priority counties in accordance to the new merit-based system, according to the highlights.
The legislation would also limit family-based immigration by preventing DREAMers from legalizing their parents after being granted permanent residency, a significant break from the current system. However, parents of DREAMers would be eligible to apply for three-year renewable work permits.
The legislation would further limit so-called family chain-migration by allowing immigrants who receive permanent legal residency to only sponsor nuclear family members, including spouses and unmarried children younger than 21, to come to the U.S. This would also represent a significant shift from the current system, which allows legal permanent residents to also sponsor additional family members, including parents and siblings.
Based on an outline of the the forthcoming bipartisan bill, the deal ""is a compromise with good and bad,"" said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, which advocates for the DREAM Act.
Sharry said he was pleased that the deal would provide relief to dreamers, their parents and those with temporary protected status but unhappy that it includes funding for Trump's ""stupid wall,"" prevents dreamers from petitioning to sponsor their parents for green cards, and curbs family-based immigration and the diversity visa program.
""But overall, it's a deal we can probably support,"" he said.",0
1406,"WSJ","President Trump and his top aides are weighing rules designed to clamp down on countries whose nationals overstay short-term visitor visas as part of a broader push for new ways to curb immigration. The effort would target nationals of countries with high overstay rates of such visas, which include the African nations of Nigeria, Chad, Eritrea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to Department of Homeland Security data. The U.S. as part of a new rule would tell the countries’ governments that if rates don’t reverse, then future visas could be shorter or harder to get, according to an administration official who described the move as putting those countries “on notice.” Ultimately, nationals from countries with high overstay rates could be barred entirely, though the official said no ban is now under consideration. The White House also is seeking to push through other rules that would tighten student and investor visas, and it is pursuing what some describe as its most ambitious goal on immigration: preventing immigrants from coming or becoming citizens if they are likely to use publicly funded benefits. The overstay proposals, for visas known as B1 or B2s, haven’t been previously reported. While President Trump has not been able to get Congress to act on his signature campaign issue of building a border wall, there's another important immigration story developing. OutletName's Gerald F. Seib explains. Photo: Getty
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said the administration considers it a priority “to reduce overstay rates for visas and the visa waiver program—and it’s well known that the administration is working to ensure faithful implementation of immigration welfare rules to protect American taxpayers.” Other rules the administration is considering include toughening requirements for investments that qualify a foreign investor for a visa, particularly in rural areas. It is expected to publish a rule pulling work authorization for the spouses of some high skilled H-1B visa holders. And the administration is considering setting a maximum length of authorized stay for student visas. The moves show the Trump administration is looking to tighten the legal framework around immigration, a core issue for the president, well beyond the much-discussed southern border. Frustration from senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller with the inability of DHS leaders to write and publish the regulations drove the departures of several department leaders last week, including Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, according to administration officials. It comes as the administration is looking to slow the flow of migrant families at the border, including a review of how to relocate detained immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities after Mr. Trump floated the idea last week. Critics of the attempt to rework rules about public benefits, in particular, say the administration is trying to do through executive action what it can’t get through Congress. “It would serve to dramatically constrain the amount of people who are able to come to the United States on any number of visas,” said Doug Rand, a former Obama administration official and co-founder of Boundless Immigration, a technology firm for families navigating the immigration process. “The implementation will likely cause sharp demographic changes in U.S. immigrants, including shifting legal immigration away from Latin America and towards Europe,” said Sarah Pierce of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute think tank. One senior administration official said last week that the administration expected to see its rules blocked by federal courts in the San Francisco-headquartered Ninth Circuit, by plaintiffs seeking out the friendly jurisdiction. But the quicker the regulations were published, the quicker any challenges could be advanced to the Supreme Court, where the administration believes it has more sympathetic justices. Pushing ahead on the new rules will be officials including acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan; his acting deputy, David Pekoske; the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence; and acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders. Many of the new rules involve U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the director of which, L. Francis Cissna, has been criticized by administration officials in recent days. Mr. Cissna’s backers believe he is being punished for trying to craft rules that pass legal muster. A USCIS official said Friday in a statement that Mr. Cissna “is relentlessly focused on advancing President Trump’s agenda forward to the maximum extent permitted under the law, and to say otherwise is false.” The official also pointed to rules published under Mr. Cissna changing the H-1B program for high-skilled immigrants, which were put out earlier this year. Mr. Trump said Friday he was giving strong consideration to the idea of moving detained immigrants to sanctuary cities, or places that typically refrain from helping federal authorities identify undocumented immigrants for deportation unless they have committed serious crimes. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, speaking on OutletName’s “This Week, said of that plan: “We’re looking to see if there are options that make it possible and doing a full and thorough and extensive review.” That plan drew criticism from Democrats over the weekend. On “OutletName Sunday,” Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.) said Mr. Trump’s statement is “clearly a political move.” He said Mr. Trump is “using immigrants as pawns in a political game of chess.” White House adviser Kellyanne Conway also said Sunday on OutletName’s “Meet the Press” that Congress should work to change the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, a law she said has encouraged immigrants to bring children to the border. She also called for congressional action to change a longstanding federal court settlement known as the Flores agreement, which she said forces the administration to “release children into the interior of this country” after 20 days of detention.",0
900,"Daily Caller","President Donald Trump vowed to close the southern border if necessary in response to the advancing caravan of illegal immigrants from Central America, in a Saturday evening Twitter declaration.
Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court. We only will allow those who come into our Country legally. Other than that our very strong policy is Catch and Detain. No “Releasing” into the U.S… — Donald J. Trump () November 24, 2018
….All will stay in Mexico. If for any reason it becomes necessary, we will CLOSE our Southern Border. There is no way that the United States will, after decades of abuse, put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore! — Donald J. Trump () November 24, 2018
The tweets mark the second time in recent days the president has vowed the drastic step as a potential action in response to illegal immigration.
“If we find that it’s uncontrollable, if we find it gets to a level where we are going to lose control or where people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control,” Trump said of potential action while speaking to reporters Thursday.
The Trump administration already resorted to such an action in recent weeks when the Department of Homeland Security noted that it had to temporarily close the busiest port of entry between the U.S. and Mexico last week in order to reinforce barriers and harden the ports of entry.
DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen noted in an announcement on Twitter at the time that the hardening was in direct response to threats from members of the migrant caravan who reportedly wanted to storm the port of entry en masse in order to overwhelm U.S. authorities and illegally seek refuge.
Trump also told reporters that U.S. troops are authorized to use lethal force at the southern border if they need to defend themselves, saying “if they have to they’re going to use lethal force, I’ve given the order, I hope they don’t have to.” The president dispatched nearly 6,000 U.S. troops to the border in recent weeks to bolster border enforcement. Trump justified the deployment by pointing at the advancing caravan of thousands of Central American would-be migrants who want to claim asylum. The caravan used violent tactics to break through legal ports of entry in Mexico, prompting alarm amongst U.S. authorities.",1
2261,"USA Today","In this Sunday Feb. 25, 2018 photo, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf holds a press conference to address potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in the area at Fruitvale Village in Oakland, Calif. In an unprecedented warning, Schaaf alerted residents of large-scale raids by ICE agents in the San Francisco Bay Area within 24 hours. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman in San Francisco has quit his post, saying he refuses to promote fake news from the Trump administration about a recent immigration sweep in Northern California.
James Schwab told the San Francisco Chronicle he resigned in frustration last week after Attorney General Jeff Sessions and ICE director Thomas Homa repeatedly claimed that more than 800 undocumented immigrants escaped arrest because Oakland Mayor Elizabeth Schaff warned of a possible crackdown hours before it began.
“I quit because I didn’t want to perpetuate misleading facts,” Schwab, who was hired during the Obama administration, told the Chronicle. “ told them that the information was wrong. They asked me to deflect, and I didn’t agree with that.""
The Justice Department has been escalating its push against so-called sanctuary cities and states. The department claimed in a lawsuit filed last week that three California laws interfere with the federal government's immigration enforcement authority.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has blasted Schaff for a Feb. 25 Twitter post warning that she had tips from ""multiple credible sources"" that a sweep was about to begin. The four-day sweep still resulted in more than 200 arrests, but Homan said more than 800 ""removable aliens"" avoided arrest, blaming Schaff's warning.
""Efforts by local politicians have shielded removable criminal aliens from immigration enforcement and created another magnet for more illegal immigration, all at the expense of the safety and security of the very people it purports to protect,"" Homan said in a statement.
Sessions made similar assertions.
""Here's my message to Mayor Schaaf: 'How dare you!'"" the attorney general said. ""How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of law enforcement officers to promote your radical open borders agenda.""
Schwab said the numbers, widely quoted in media across the nation, were false because there was never any chance that all of the estimated 1,000 undocumented immigrants were going to be caught in the sweep.
“I didn’t feel like fabricating the truth to defend ourselves against (Schaaf’s) actions was the way to go about it,” Schwab said. “To say that 100% are dangerous criminals on the street, or that those people weren’t picked up because of the misguided actions of the mayor, is just wrong.”
Schaff applauded Schwab, citing his commitment to the truth.
“Our democracy depends on public servants who act with integrity and hold transparency in the highest regard,"" she said.",0
1299,"WSJ","Arrests of people crossing the Southwestern border have plummeted 75% since May, marking one of the most dramatic drops in recent history and a sign that policy changes by the Trump administration and Mexico are reducing migration to the U.S. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Monday that 33,510 people were arrested after illegally crossing the border in November, marking the sixth straight monthly decline since May, when 132,000 such apprehensions marked a 13-year high. The majority of those apprehended last year were families and unaccompanied children from Central America, nearly all of whom surrendered to border officials seeking asylum in the U.S. An unexpected surge of such migrants in the spring of this year created a crisis as the federal government proved unable to process them efficiently in safe and healthy conditions. Of those arrested in November, 9,000 were traveling as families, according to CBP. Border arrests typically decline this time of year and rise again in the spring when temperatures warm. Even so, the May-November decline is the biggest in absolute numbers and second biggest by percentage of any six-month period this century. The last few months of the Obama administration and the first few of the Trump administration saw a 76% drop, starting from a smaller peak of 47,211. “This is a direct result due to this president’s strategies to address the historic flood of Central Americans, families, illegally crossing the border,” acting CBP Comissioner Mark Morgan said at a press conference Monday. “The network of initiatives have worked and continues to work.” In Tucson, Ariz., a migrant shelter has seen arrivals drop from more than 100 a day last year to fewer than 40 recently, according to its operator, Teresa Cavendish. In McAllen, Texas, a recently opened shelter intended for migrants had so many empty beds last month that it began to serve other members of the community. “We had a cold front, we had space to allow the homeless to come in and we opened the doors,” said Sister Norma Pimentel, executive director of Catholic Charities in the Rio Grande Valley. The Movimiento Juventud 2000 shelter in Tijuana, Mexico, had as many as 170 people in the summer, where they paused before crossing into the U.S. Now it houses 98, said shelter director José María García. Some of the people at Movimiento Juventud are waiting for their cases to be resolved through the Trump administration’s Migrant Protection Protocols program, which since January has sent 54,000 migrants back to Mexico to await adjudication of their asylum claims. Previously, most migrants traveling as families who requested asylum were released in the U.S. CBP had previously said roughly 59,000 people had been sent back, but revised the figure after auditing data on the program. The program, often called Remain in Mexico, is one of the biggest contributors to the decline of border arrests, immigration experts say. It has deterred some people from coming into the U.S., because of the knowledge that they are likely to be stranded in Mexico for months while their cases are decided. “I think the big factor has been the Trump administration policies,” said Randy Capps, director of research of U.S. programs at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. Critics say the Migrant Protection Protocols program has left people with few resources in high-crime cities in Mexico and that the program prompts some with valid asylum claims to give up. A recent report by the advocacy group Human Rights First documented 636 public reports of kidnapping, torture or other attacks on people in the Remain in Mexico program. Other factors that often alter migration flows, including crime rates and unemployment in the U.S. and migrants’ home countries, haven’t dramatically changed in recent months, Mr. Capps said. Mexican security efforts at its southern border with Guatemala, which it undertook after tariff threats from the Trump administration, have also had an impact, said Mr. Capps. Most migrant families in recent years have traveled through Mexico from the Central American nations of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, fleeing weak economies, crime and corruption. Carlos Chirinos, 47, is currently living in a shelter in Reynosa, Mexico, waiting to see if he will be allowed into the U.S. His next hearing is in April 2020, he said. Assaults, kidnappings and rapes are common in Reynosa, Mr. Chirinos said. “This is inhuman,” he said about Migrant Protection Protocols in a phone interview. Government officials have defended the program’s impact on migrants, insisting it allows their claims to be decided faster than for those waiting in the U.S., where a court backlog of more than one million cases can mean a yearslong delay. As the number of families crossing the border to seek asylum rose dramatically in 2018 and 2019, thousands of children were separated from their parents at the border; tens of thousands of families were released at shelters, parks and bus stations along the border; and several children died in government custody. Some experts have said the reduction in migration could reverse if Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador decides to stop cooperating with U.S. policy due to internal political considerations. He has deployed some 26,000 troops from his country’s newly created National Guard to help with immigration enforcement efforts, including roadside checkpoints and raids on hotels, cargo trains and safe houses. Mexican authorities arrested about 81,000 foreign migrants between June and September, nearly double the number of a year earlier, according to Mexico’s immigration agency. “It’s an enormous effort of money and logistics that I doubt can be sustained in time,” said Rubén Figueroa, a Mexican human rights advocate. The López Obrador government has pledged that the security efforts will be permanent. The goal, one Mexican official said, is to keep the month average of arrests in the U.S. below 40,000, a figure near that recorded in the five years before the latest surge.",0
470,"Breitbart","Mark Zuckerberg’s immigration lobbyist says President Donald Trump’s 2016 voters will stick with him “100 percent” in 2020 if he signs amnesty legislation backed by the Koch business group.
“Polling and common sense dictates this to be true,” said a tweet from Todd Schulte, director of the FWD.US lobbying group, which is trying to preserve the federal policy of importing more than 1 million new consumers and workers each year. He continued:
People think the President is gonna see a bunch of people vote for a Dem or Howard Schultz if he signs a border and daca deal? This is not a real thing, just a scare tactic.
Schulte did not refer to the more likely result of a Trump-signed, Koch-backed amnesty bill: A sharp drop in enthusiasm and turnout for Trump in 2020.
That turnout slump likely would be seen among the blue-collar Americans hit by illegal migration and among the white-collar Americans who are slammed by U.S. companies’ employment of roughly 1.5 million college-educated, temporary visa workers.
Schulte’s FWD was created by Zuckerberg, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and a variety of investors to promote amnesty and cheap labor. The group backed the 2013 “Gang of Eight” amnesty which would have allowed an unlimited inflow of foreign graduates and has waged an expensive campaign against Trump’s 2016 campaign and his Inauguration Day “Hire American” promise.
Schulte’s tweet was also intended to defend former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who claimed on OutletName that Trump’s base would support a bill which combined a “DACA” amnesty with some wall-construction money.
Gingrich’s statement was slammed by author Ann Coulter and also by Mickey Kaus, who is a left-of-center, pro-American immigration reformer. Kaus Tweeted:
Newt wasn’t saying ignore Coulter, Trump’s base’ll be fine with no wall. He was saying ignore Coulter, Trump’s base’ll be fine with Koch/Kushner deal to LEGALIZE DREAMERS. Not so sure about that! (‘You voted Trump, you got amnesty!’)
LOST IN THE COVERAGE: Newt wasn't saying ignore Coulter, Trump's base'll be fine with no wall. He was saying ignore Coulter, Trump's base'll be fine with Koch/Kushner deal to LEGALIZE DREAMERS. Not so sure about that! ('You voted Trump, you got amnesty!') ://t.co/LfLmI3fYn7 — Mickey Kaus () January 28, 2019
In his OutletName interview on January 28, Gingrich backed an amnesty for illegals who crossed the border as children — dubbed “dreamers” by lobbyists and a friendly media. He endorsed an amnesty even though their numbers may exceed 3 million, even though an amnesty would eventually provide their illegal-immigrant parents with legal residency, and even though few would ever vote for GOP candidates.
Gingrich said:
I very much want to see [White House officials] take care of the dreamers as a part of this package, and I know, talking to [GOP Sen.] Lindsey Graham and others, there’s real interest in the Senate on a bipartisan basis to get a deal that takes care of the dreamers, takes care of the southern border, meets the President’s needs and gets signed … Is he going to veto a bill that includes [an amnesty]? I don’t think so. … He should not pay any attention to Ann Coulter. Ann Coulter has never run for office, she does not know anything about how you put a [congressional] majority together. She’s off here in some fantasy land where she gets to be noisy which helps her sell books. The fact is, the President’s base is with the President … If he goes to them and says “I’ve got this done for the wall, I’ve got this done to protect America, I’m doing these good things you believe in,” the base is going to say “Fine.” Eighty percent of the country believes he ought to find legal ways for people who came here as children to become legal in a way that is not necessarily a path to citizenship, but certainly a path to a job. Sometimes, you have got to say to your base “Hey, if you are really my base you’ve got to stick with me.”
However, the public is sharply opposed to a wall-for-amnesty deal. OutletName News reported January 28:
The latest Monmouth University Poll reveals that about 88 percent of voters said they oppose efforts to tie an amnesty for illegal aliens to border wall funding. Instead, voters said the issues should be dealt with separately. More than 80 percent of Republicans, 90 percent of swing-voters, and even 95 percent of Democrats said they oppose an amnesty-for-border wall deal. Non-college educated white voters, the base of President Trump’s support, massively oppose the amnesty-for-wall deal by about 88 percent. All voters without a college degree oppose the plan by about 89 percent, as well as 92 percent of minority voters.
Coulter — who has slammed Trump for failing to win much wall funding – quickly made fun of Gingrich’s claims by portraying him as a Trump sycophant:
The great thing about Newt is, you can always count on him to tell truth to power. — Ann Coulter () January 28, 2019
The same day, Schulte jumped in to defend Gingrich from Kaus and Coulter:
I mean…100% they would be. Polling and common sense dictates this to be true.

In late January, Schulte stepped up his efforts to marginalize Coulter, Kaus and other advocates of Trump’s “Hire American” policy which has successfully pushed up wages for Americans. He tweeted:
The whole weird point is people like Ann Coulter have almost zero power. The President is the voice to those voters wishes — but he has people around him who tell him otherwise for their own agendas, and he has FOBL (Fear of Base Loss). But his perception is off. — Todd Schulte () January 26, 2019

Schulte’s FWD.us backs the establishment’s economic policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth.
But that policy also shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white collar and blue collar foreign labor.
That annual flood of roughly one million legal immigrants — as well as visa workers and illegal immigrants — spikes profits and Wall Street values by shrinking salaries for 150 million blue-collar and white-collar employees, and especially wages for the four million young Americans who join the labor force each year.
Progressives offer more customers & revenue to investors if they help block Trump's 'public charge' merit-reform of the nation's process for picking immigrants. Lots of money and political power at stake. ://t.co/HJ7AyOT5hQ — Neil Munro () September 24, 2018
The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that coastal investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices and pushes poor U.S. Americans, including Latinos and blacks, out of prosperous cities such as Berkeley and Oakland.",1
1295,"WSJ","New York City’s Commission on Human Rights could seek fines of up to $250,000 against landlords and employers who threaten to call federal agents on undocumented immigrants or say “go back to your country” to someone. Since 1989, the city’s human-rights law has banned discrimination based on citizenship status or “alienage” in employment, housing and public accommodations. On Wednesday, the commission released new guidelines specifying what threats violate the law. The commission acts as a city watchdog and enforces human-rights laws. It can seek civil penalties against an individual or business accused of discrimination. Under the new guidelines, the commission could seek a fine if a landlord, employer or store owner threatens to call Immigration and Customs Enforcement against an undocumented immigrant or someone perceived to be one. The commission would also seek civil penalties against a landlord, employer or store owner who uses the term “illegal” or “alien” against someone in a derogatory manner. City officials said they believe New York is the first jurisdiction in the country to explicitly frame their laws to protect immigrants in such a way as it relates to housing and public accommodations, which include retail stores, restaurants and schools. Carmelyn Malalis, the chair of the city’s human-rights commission, said in an interview she foresees other U.S. cities following New York’s example. “I think it is clear to everyone that we are living in a time where there has been anti-immigrant, xenophobic rhetoric that has largely been spurred by comments made by federal government officials,” she said. A city administrative judge on Sept. 12 ordered a Queens landlord to pay a $5,000 fine and $12,000 in damages after the commission accused her of threatening to call ICE on a tenant who had stopped paying rent, OutletName reported last week. Anyone in the city can file an inquiry with the commission if they believe they have faced discrimination. In 2016, the commission received 501 inquires related to discrimination based on national origin or immigration status, a 72% increase from the 291 it got a year earlier. In 2018, 393 inquiries were filed. If the commission finds the allegations credible, it can bring a case against an individual accused of violating the law. The city’s Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings adjudicates the cases. Wednesday’s announcement of enforcement guidance mirrors the commission’s release of similar guidelines on antiblack discrimination related to hairstyles such as Afros and braids earlier this year. Sonia Lin, the general counsel for the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, said the new guidance is a key step to ensuring that the city’s immigrants are aware of their rights. “At this time when there is a lot of fear and confusion amongst immigrant communities, we have found that it’s more important than ever that immigrant New Yorkers know their rights,” Ms. Lin said.",0
783,"Daily Caller","OutletName host Tucker Carlson asked Democratic political commentator Jonathan Harris to describe the difference between an “immoral and a moral physical barrier on our border.”
Harris quickly managed to paint himself into a corner as he attempted to justify Democratic leadership’s refusal to give President Trump money to fund a border barrier.
“There’s a difference between a physical barrier — most of which is already in place — and a concrete wall which Trump wants,” Harris said as the two began discussing the issue.
“What is the difference between what they have voted for and what [Trump is] proposing?” Carlson asked.
“I think it hinges less upon what is there and more about the $5 billion he wants to build something else,” Harris responded. “They have already voted in support of fencing there. Trump actually criticized it.”
Harris quoted a OutletName report saying the wall would only stop a third of illegal immigration, then called funding it “a waste of money.” “So Democrats are budget hawks now?” Tucker asked, laughing.
Harris laughed, then mentioned the balanced budget under Clinton before saying that they are “kind of,” but “they just don’t talk about it.”
“Democrats are saying his proposal is immoral,” Tucker pressed. “Their proposal is moral. What’s the difference between an immoral and a moral physical barrier on our border?”
“Because one doesn’t cost $5 billion,” Harris responded.
“So it’s the cost that is immoral,” said Carlson. “So any time we spend $5 billion needlessly, we’re committing an immoral act?”
“It’s not about committing an immoral act,” said Harris. “This is about spending $5 billion to build a wall, that is ineffective to address the illegal immigration that does not come from our southern border but comes from legal ports of entry.”
Carlson pointed out the hypocrisy of Harris’ view by citing a parallel example of whether or not Harris would be “willing to shut down the government” over “$5 billion we spent on something that would not help the country.”
“That would be problematic,” said Harris. “I’m not president. Trump is president and he shut down the government.”
“So the cost, the nature of the barrier, those are not relevant to anything,” noted the OutletName host. “What we’re talking about is the fear what Trump is proposing might actually work. That’s the actual problem.”",1
2418,"Reuters","U.S. arrests of suspected illegal immigrants rose by nearly 40 percent in the first 100 days of Donald Trump’s presidency, following executive orders that broadened the scope of who could be targeted for immigration violations, according to government data released on Wednesday. The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Thomas Homan said that arrests by his agency jumped to 41,318 between January 22 of this year and the end of April, up from 30,028 arrests in roughly the same period last year. Of those arrested almost two-thirds had criminal convictions. But there was also a significant jump - of more than 150 percent - in the number of immigrants not convicted of further crimes arrested by ICE: 10,800 since the beginning of the year compared to 4,200 non-criminal arrests in the same period in 2016. That increase is a result of recent guidance given by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to implement Trump’s executive orders on interior immigration enforcement and border security signed on Jan. 25, just days after the Republican president took office. “Those that enter the country illegally, they do violate the law, that is a criminal act,” Homan said on the call, while emphasizing that immigrants who pose a threat to national security or have criminal records are still a priority for the agency. He said ICE will continue to target people who have been issued a final order of removal by an immigration judge even if they have not committed another crime. “When a federal judge makes a decision and issues an order that order needs to mean something,” Homan said. “If we don’t take action on those orders, then we are just spinning our wheels.” While President Barack Obama was also criticized for deporting a large number of immigrants, most of them were recent border crossers apprehended entering the country illegally. Deportations under Trump have actually fallen by 12 percent compared to the same period under Obama, Homan said, as more people arrested in the interior typically have more complicated cases that can get slowed down in the backlogged immigration court system. The number of people caught crossing the border with Mexico is down significantly since the begin of the year, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Immigration advocates and some cities with large immigrant populations have raised concerns about the stepped up enforcement in the interior of the country. On Wednesday, state attorneys general from New York, California, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington D.C., issued a report laying out why they have chosen to limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration agents. A section of one of the president’s executive orders aimed to cut off federal funding to so-called “sanctuary cities,” was been blocked by a federal judge in California.",0
2313,"USA Today","A prominent Florida lobbyist who raised money for President Trump’s campaign and his inaugural committee this week landed a slew of corporate clients, eager to tap those connections to help them navigate the new administration.
Fifteen clients — ranging from online retail giant Amazon.com to Spanish-language network Univision — signed contracts with Brian Ballard’s new federal lobbying firm, Ballard Partners. He says more corporations will join the roster next week.
His lobbying partner, Susie Wiles, managed Trump’s Florida campaign.
Ballard said he doesn’t plan to act in a way that’s “exploitative of the relationship” he has with Trump and the White House. But he added: “I do think it’s clear that I understand his thinking, and I think I can provide some strategic counsel.”
Trump made “draining the swamp” of Washington special interests a rallying cry of his campaign, but his presidency and the unified Republican control of the nation’s capital have sparked new lobbying opportunities for companies seeking to influence everything from tax policy to Trump’s pledge to slash federal regulations.
The new president also has demonstrated he’s willing to single out individual companies. Trump and Amazon had a contentious relationship during the campaign, with Trump taking to Twitter to complain about Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ownership of The Washington Post.
(After the election, Bezos congratulated Trump on his win and joined other tech executives who met the real-estate magnate in New York. But he has joined dozens of other tech executives who have raised alarms about Trump temporary immigration ban.)
During the campaign, Trump had a run-in with a well-known Univision figure, Jorge Ramos. Trump ejected the opinionated anchor from an Iowa news conference last summer after a heated exchange about the then-candidate’s immigration policies.Another Washington client for Ballard already signaled its support for Trump. The GEO Group, one of the nation’s largest private-prison operators, donated more than $200,000 in the 2016 election to a pro-Trump super PAC.
The company opposed the Obama administration’s move to phase out the use of privately run federal prisons. But the industry views Trump’s law-and-order stance as good for business.
GEO Group, based in Florida, is among several of Ballard’s existing state clients expanding with him to Washington, he said. Other Washington clients include the American Health Care Association, the U.S. Sugar Corporation and American Airlines, he said.
Ballard has deep ties to the Republican establishment as a top Florida fundraiser for the presidential campaigns of Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2008 and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in 2012.
Ballard, who has lobbied for the Trump businesses in Florida, initially backed Jeb Bush and then Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in the 2016 Republican presidential primary before joining Trump’s camp. He also served as a finance co-chair of Trump’s inaugural committee, which raised a record $100 million for the real-estate magnate’s swearing-in festivities.

1338,"WSJ","Crisanto Andrade, a Salvadoran who has lived on Long Island for nearly two decades, sees two bad choices in his future. With his protected immigration status ending in September 2019, Mr. Andrade must decide between returning to El Salvador, where wages are low and violent gangs run rampant, and staying in the U.S. illegally. “What I make in a week here, I can’t make in a month over there,” Mr. Andrade said. In El Salvador, he added, “you need permission from the gangs to visit family members in other neighborhoods.... It’s a disgrace.” The 45-year-old groundskeeper, who lives with his 20-year-old son in Uniondale, is among the 14,700 Salvadorans on Long Island enrolled in a U.S. humanitarian program known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS. Salvadorans are the largest group of TPS holders and have been allowed to live and work in the U.S. since 2001, when a pair of earthquakes destroyed parts of the country. Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced it would end Salvadorans’ protected status, saying the disruption to living conditions caused by the earthquakes no longer exists. The Department of Homeland Security said it would give Salvadorans in the program 18 months to prepare to leave the country or apply for some other immigration status allowing them to stay. The change in policy “underscores the temporary nature of TPS, and reminds us that it was never intended to be used as a tool to sidestep the legal immigration process,” said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a lobbying group that favors lower levels of immigration, in a statement. Cesar Claros, 28, left, said it isn’t an option for his mother, Dora Diaz, to return to El Salvador. ‘If she goes back, she has nothing over there,’ the Hempstead resident said. ‘Her whole life is here.’ For Mr. Andrade and the 260,000 Salvadorans protected by the program, the move has led to upended lives and future plans. “Most will stay without papers,” said Walter Barrientos who works with a local chapter of Make the Road New York, an advocacy group that provides legal services to immigrants. “It’s not really an option for them to go back.” It has also raised concerns in the U.S. communities they call home. According to an analysis by the Suffolk County Department of Economic Development and Planning, the removal of protected Salvadorans from Long Island would result in an annual loss of $800 million in household spending in the region, a reduction of $1.4 billion in economic output and the potential loss of 13,500 jobs. Ending the program “could ultimately result in a massive economic hit to Long Island,” Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone and Nassau County Executive Laura Curra wrote in a recent letter to Long Island’s congressional delegation. Dora Diaz fled El Salvador’s civil war in 1986 and currently has protected status. She fears that if she returns she would become a target of gangs. El Salvador is the home base for MS-13, a transnational gang that has made the country one of the deadliest in the world. While the gang has spread all the way to Long Island, their influence here pales in comparison to El Salvador. The homicide rate in El Salvador in 2016 was 81 per 100,000 inhabitants, compared with 5 per 100,000 residents for the U.S. “Whatever little money you have, they take it from you,” said Ms. Diaz, 49, who has no family in El Salvador. She plans to apply for a family-based immigrant visa, in the hope that she will be approved before the September 2019 deadline. Jose Bonilla, 47, from Hempstead has two brothers, three nephews and three cousins in the program who live on Long Island. He said they would likely stay in the U.S. illegally. “That’s really their only option,” Mr. Bonilla said. If the gangs in El Salvador “see that you have small businesses to support your family, they will make you pay ‘rent.’ And if you don’t give them what you want, they can kill you.” Mr. Andrade, from Uniondale, also plans to stay, even though he isn’t eligible for the family-based immigrant visa (none of his relatives are U.S. citizens). His wife and four of his children still live in El Salvador, and he needs to make money to support them. “We deserve better treatment and dignity,” said Mr. Andrade.",0
486,"Breitbart","Three-quarters of Republicans support President Donald J. Trump declaring a national emergency to build a wall along America’s southern border, according to a poll released on Wednesday.
Seventy-six percent of Republicans support President Trump declaring a national emergency to build a wall along the southern border, according to a Morning Consult/Politico survey released on Wednesday.
The poll found that 52 percent of Republicans “strongly support” Trump declaring a national emergency and 24 percent of Republicans somewhat support the president using emergency powers to build a wall.
In contrast, 71 percent of Democrats strongly oppose Trump using building the wall through a national emergency.
When given the choice of whether Trump should shut down the government, Trump should declare an emergency, or Trump should do neither of these options, a near majority of Republican voters said that Trump should declare a national emergency and 12 percent somewhat oppose such a measure.
Forty-seven percent of Republican voters said that Trump should declare a national emergency, 20 percent of Republican voters said that Trump should shut down the government again, and 22 percent said that Trump should do neither of these options.
The poll arises as President Trump recently ended the longest government shutdown in American history in his quest to obtain border wall funding. Congress has re-opened the government until February 15; however, Trump said that there remains a “good chance” he could declare a national emergency to build the wall if Congress will not fund the border wall.
Overall, 81 percent of Republicans approve of President Trump’s job performance, with 51 percent of GOP voters strongly approving of the president’s handling of the presidency.
The Morning Consult survey also suggested that Republican voters believe it’s increasingly unlike that Congress will provide funding for Trump to build the wall.
At the beginning of the shutdown, 54 percent of GOP voters said that it remains unlikely that Congress will provide full funding for Trump’s proposed border wall along the American southern border. Now, 64 percent of Republicans voters believe Congress will not likely provide full funding for the wall.
Amongst registered voters, Republicans hold an advantage on the issue of immigration. Forty percent of voters said that they trust Republicans in Congress to handle immigration, while 38 percent Democrats, and 21 percent of voters that they either did not know or did not have an opinion.
Forty-six percent of Republican voters, or a near majority, said that building a wall along the southern border wall serves as a top priority, and 30 percent of GOP voters said it was an important, but lower priority. Meanwhile, 50 percent of Democrats said that America should not build a wall.
Trump has continued to push Congress to pass a border security bill that contains border wall funding, although he has stated that if Congress cannot fulfill its duties to secure the country’s border, then he might declare a national emergency.
“I think we have a good chance,” Trump said at the White House last week. “We’ll work with the Democrats and negotiate and if we can’t do that, then obviously we’ll do the emergency because that’s what it is. It’s a national emergency.”",1
2461,"Reuters","Immigration tops the economy and healthcare as the most important issue determining Americans’ vote ahead of the midterm elections in November, a new OutletName/Ipsos opinion poll shows. OutletName/Ipsos data shows that immigration became a top concern for registered voters in the United States after the Trump administration in May announced its “zero tolerance” policy on illegal immigrants, saying they would be criminally charged. The policy became a political lightning rod in mid-June with disclosures that thousands of children were separated from their parents who were accused of crossing illegally into the country. The poll, conducted between June 28 and July 2, found: - Fifteen percent of U.S. registered voters said immigration was the top issue determining how they will cast their ballot in November, while 14 percent said the economy was their biggest concern. - Twenty-six percent of registered Republicans cited immigration as the most important issue likely to determine their vote, up 14 percentage points from a similar poll conducted at the beginning of June. - Healthcare remains the top issue for registered Democrats (16 percent), followed by the economy (14 percent), the OutletName/Ipsos poll shows. Seven percent of Democrats cited immigration as their top concern. - However, Trump’s approval on his handling of immigration remains little changed since the beginning of the year, with 52 percent of registered voters saying in an ongoing OutletName/Ipsos poll that they disapprove of the way the president is handling immigration. Americans are squarely divided along partisan lines on Trump’s stance on immigration: Eighty-one percent of Republicans said they approve of his handling of the issue while 84 percent of registered Democrats said they disapprove.",0
1468,"WSJ","The Trump administration started separating parents and children caught crossing the Mexican border illegally last month as part of a broader “zero-tolerance” approach that has led to thousands of adult border crossers being charged with a crime for coming into the country illegally. The policy to separate families was rescinded last week and caused confusion and chaos as parents sought to find their children in a vast bureaucratic system. Here is a look at some of the issues: What happens to families who are apprehended after illegally crossing the U.S. border with Mexico?
Migrants caught crossing the border illegally are arrested by the U.S. Border Patrol and taken to nearby processing centers where they spend up to 72 hours. Families, most of whom are seeking asylum in the U.S., are generally held for up to 20 days at one of two family detention centers in Texas before being released to await their court dates inside the U.S. A family detention center in Pennsylvania is licensed to hold families longer. Historically, when there is no space for the families in detention centers they are released from custody with orders to return to immigration authorities. The parent typically is made to wear an ankle bracelet to monitor their movements. What happens when a family claims asylum at a legal port of entry?
Families who seek asylum at a port of entry aren’t arrested but can also face detention for up to 20 days at the facilities in Texas before they must be released to await a court hearing. The asylum process for immigrants released from immigration jails can take years amid a backlog of more than 700,000 pending cases in immigration court. Where are families held in detention? And how long can they stay?
The Department of Homeland Security has three family detention centers, two in Texas and one Pennsylvania. The South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, about 75 miles southwest of San Antonio, has space for 2,500 women and children. The Karnes County Family Residential Center, about 55 miles southeast of San Antonio, has space for 1,158 women and children. A third facility, the Berks County Residential Center in Leesport, Pa., about 70 miles northwest of Philadelphia, can house about 100 people, including some fathers and their children. Parents and children can be detained at the Texas facilities for no more than 20 days under the rules of the decades-old Flores Settlement. The Pennsylvania facility is licensed as a child-care facility so families can be held there longer. Where are the separated children being held?
More than 2,000 immigrant children separated from their parents at the border in May and June are being housed at child-immigrant shelters, group homes or in foster care around the country. The Department of Health and Human Services, the government agency charged with caring for unaccompanied immigrant children who cross the Mexican border without their families, oversees about 100 shelters in 17 states. Migrant children separated from their families at the border were sent to HHS shelters. How old are the children who are coming to the border either on their own or with this parents?
The government doesn’t widely release age breakdowns of children arriving at the border, with or without their parents. According to government data collected through public records requests by the Transactional Records Clearinghouse at Syracuse University the majority of the unaccompanied immigrant children found at the border between Oct. 1 and April were 16 or 17 years old. About 3% of unaccompanied children found by the Border Patrol were younger than 3. During that same period, just over half of the children traveling with their parents were 7 years old or younger. About a quarter of the children were 3 or younger and about 5% were as old as 17. These data precede the family separation policy. How do immigration authorities seek to prevent child trafficking?
Border Patrol agents and Customs officers interview immigrants arrested at the border or those who come to legal ports of entry. Agency officials have said they speak to purported parents and children and look for verbal and physical cues to try to determine if someone is lying about a family relationship. Agents and officers also try to verify any documents carried by immigrants, including birth certificates and custody documents. In cases where a family relationship is doubted, adults and children can be separated. Department of Homeland Security said earlier this month that so far this fiscal year there had been nearly 200 cases of suspected fraud.",0
630,"Daily Caller","A Spanish language reporter who has spent weeks embedded with the migrant caravan said in a Friday report that people from Bangladesh had joined the mass of people trying to cross from Guatemala into Mexico.
Univision correspondent Francisco Santa Anna reported from the bridge separating Guatemala and Mexico. The bridge has been packed with thousands of migrants demanding access to Mexico, with the ultimate goal of crossing the border of the United States illegally. The caravan has now swelled to many thousands.
The Bangladeshis, he said, were detained in an immigration facility, though it’s not clear what happened to them after their detention.
“The borders in Central American are not as strong as the U.S., which makes it possible for people from Panama and Ecuador to cross easily,” Santa Anna said on Univision. “They cross from Costa Rica, then later go through Guatemala and eventually make it into our country.”
“Yesterday when we were traveling through Guatemala, we noticed people from El Salvador and even people from Bangladesh,” he continued. “Can you imagine what they had to do to get here? They infiltrated themselves in this caravan and tried to cross with the crowd. That would have benefited them greatly.”
Bangladesh has one of the largest populations of Muslims in the world. Its 141 million Muslims is more than the combined populations of Iran, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, Georgetown University professor C. Christine Fair noted in an essay in Lawfare.
The country is “increasingly the site of Islamist violence,” Fair wrote.
According to the essay “Political Islam and Islamist Terrorism in Bangladesh: What You Need to Know”:
Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) and the Islamic State (IS) have increased their activity in Bangladesh in recent years. IS has taken responsibility for attacks on foreigners, homosexuals, Shia, Ahmadis, Sufis, and other religious minorities, among other groups. Islamist militants have targeted secular writers and bloggers in particular, with an online “hit list.” Dozens of Bangladeshis, including persons of Bangladeshi extraction in the United Kingdom, have gone to fight with the Islamic State, and in April 2016, the organization’s English-language magazine, Dabiq, offered a tribute to a Bangladeshi militant who died in Syria.
The country of Bangladesh borders India and is many thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean from the caravan’s departure point.",1

443,"Breitbart","MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico’s top diplomat said Monday his country will spend about $50 million to hire lawyers for migrants in the United States facing deportation.
The money will be channeled through Mexican consulates in the U.S. and also go to outreach programs “to promote respect for Mexicans’ rights.”
Foreign Relations Secretary Luis Videgaray said the effort “isn’t about obstructing the enforcement of the law in the United States, or much less opposing law enforcement.”
“We are going to focus the money on one fundamental objective, which is the defense of the rights of Mexicans. This means legal advice, informational campaigns, the hiring of lawyers where it is necessary.”
Videgaray also says Mexico understands “it will be necessary to make some changes” to the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. and Canada. U.S. President Donald Trump has pledged to re-negotiate NAFTA.
But he said Monday that Mexico won’t accept a return to protectionist policies such as import quotas or tariffs.
He mentioned including things such as e-commerce, which didn’t exist when NAFTA took effect in 1994. Videgaray did not specify what other changes Mexico would be open to, but did say the country wanted “integrated negotiations, where all topics will be discussed and the dialogue won’t be limited to commercial aspects, for example, but also include issues like immigration and security.”
Along with renegotiating NAFTA, Trump has pledged to increase the deportations of people who are in the United States illegally, positions that have caused major frictions with Mexico.
Videgaray said Mexico wants to diversify its trade. At present, about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports go to the United States.
He said Mexico wants to improve trade with Latin American countries, Japan and especially South Korea.
Mexico also wants to negotiate free trade agreements with Brazil and Argentina and attract foreign investment from China, the foreign relations secretary said.",1
465,"Breitbart","A Republican-Democrat House and Senate committee is planning to offer President Trump a border security package that could include less than a quarter of the $5.7 billion for a U.S.-Mexico border wall he originally requested.
Capitol Hill sources tell the media that a conference committee of Republicans and Democrats is preparing to unveil a border security funding plan that gives only about $1.3 to $2 billion to Trump for construction of his proposed wall on the southern border to stop wage-crushing illegal immigration.
OutletName reports:
On Capitol Hill, House and Senate conferees were nearing an agreement that could offer the president between $1.3 billion and around $2 billion in funding for border security, a range, still subject to change, that could include some physical barriers and result in a deal as early as Monday. Talk of a wall has given way to “bollard fencing” and strategic placements. [Emphasis added]
This $1.3 to $2 billion would be the total spending for border security, meaning the funding for the proposed border wall would be a figure potentially less than $1.3 billion.
Despite previously committing that he would not accept anything less than $5 billion in funding for a border wall in a border security package, Trump is now telling lawmakers and aides that he is open to accepting just $2 billion for the wall, sources told the OutletName:
Mr. Trump has told allies he would grudgingly accept a figure of around $2 billion, but House Democrats remain publicly opposed to spending that much on physical barriers. It is still not clear how much of the final allocation would go for new fencing, according to three people briefed on the negotiations. [Emphasis added] … Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, told senators at a party lunch and in private conversations over the past few days that Mr. Trump had told him, “I can live with $2 billion,” according to a Senate aide who witnessed one of the exchanges. [Emphasis added]
The conference committee was formed after Trump reopened the federal government following a shutdown without securing any funding for the border wall. Members of the committee include:
Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, Texas Rep. Kay Granger, Tennesee Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, Georgia Rep. Tom Graves, and Mississippi Rep. Steven Palazzo, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, Illinois Sen. Richard Durbin, Montana Sen. Jon Tester, New York Rep. Nita Lowey, California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, North Carolina Rep. David Price, California Rep. Barbara Lee, Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, and California Rep. Pete Aguilar.
The committee was formed to work on a funding package for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with a deadline of February 15, a funding route that experts have said the president never had to take.
Defense Department officials have reiterated that Trump does not need approval from Congress and, also, does not have to declare a national emergency to begin construction of the border wall. Instead, the president could have invoked 10 United States Code § 284, which authorizes the U.S. military to build barriers at the southern border, a Pentagon official has testified to Congress.
Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) has urged Trump to invoke these executive powers to immediately begin building the border wall.
“I think what [Trump] needs to do now is Title 10 gives him authority to you know where there’s an active drug corridor … that the Department of Defense can access money and build a fence, I think he needs to do that … I think that needs to happen,” Biggs said last month.
Total construction of the proposed southern border wall would cost about $25 billion, far from the funding the GOP-Democrat committee is expected to offer. At the current rate, securing about $1.3 to $2 billion for the border wall would fund less than 205 miles of wall construction on the roughly 2,000-mile long U.S.-Mexico border.
While Congress and Trump haggle dally over border wall funding, mass illegal immigration has continued at the southern border. Border apprehension data from December 2018 reveal that the number of adults traveling to the southern border with children has skyrocketed by 280 percent compared to the same time last year.
Illegal immigration at the border, for December 2018, has increased 81 percent compared to this same month the year before. Additionally, between January 25 and February 15 — the period that Trump has given Congress to work on a border security package — there is likely to be anywhere between 30,000 to 44,000 illegal border crossings based on previous DHS totals. This is about 1,300 to 2,000 illegal crossings a day at the southern border.",1
878,"Daily Caller","President Donald Trump has often noted that America’s rich and powerful choose to live behind large walls for protection, much like the wall he is trying to build across the U.S.-Mexico border.
Nowhere has that thesis proven truer than in the posh neighborhoods of Los Angeles and Hollywood. The homes of the rich and famous, peppered throughout the area, are often gated and feature high walls that protect the homes from outsiders.
But what about the viscerally anti-Trump celebrities that reside in Hollywood and hate the idea of Trump’s border wall? Do these moguls, sports and film celebrities really live behind walls? OutletName set out to find the truth in a series called “Walls Across America.”
Celebrities like Jimmy Kimmel, Chelsea Handler, Jim Carrey, Barbara Streisand, Rob Reiner and Mark Hamill have used their massive celebrity platforms to advocate harshly against Trump’s immigration policies.
So how do these rich progressive celebrities choose to protect the things they love? We investigated.
In a recent Oval Office address to the nation, President Trump said, “Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences and gates around their homes?” “They don’t build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside,” the president claimed. “The only thing that is immoral is the politicians who do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.”
The president continues to make a case for the construction of a border wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, the funding of which incited the longest government shutdown in history. Trump has agreed to reopen the government and a bipartisan congressional group is attempting to produce an agreeable package for border security.
In our last episode of “Walls Across America,” we traveled to George Soros’ mansion in the Hamptons to investigate the massive wall around his home.",1
677,"Daily Caller","A Silicon Valley man who provided logistical support and recruited for al-Qaida had his U.S. citizenship revoked by a federal judge Thursday.
Egyptian-born Khaled Abu Dahab, 57, confessed to being a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, an al-Qaida affiliate, and said he had personal ties to Osama Bin Laden.
Dahab told U.S. investigators he ran a communications hub for the terrorist network from his apartment in Santa Clara, Calif., the OutletName reported. He also recruited Americans to join al-Qaida, a job he did so well that he received congratulations from Bin Laden himself, U.S. authorities said.
Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered an order that revoked Dahab’s naturalized U.S. citizenship and enjoined him from claiming any rights of citizenship. The order further demanded that Dahab immediately surrender his certificate of naturalization to federal authorities, Department of Justice officials said.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions praised the decision and said DOJ would seek to “aggressively pursue denaturalization of known or suspected terrorists” in the future.
“We will protect our national security and our borders, and when we identify individuals tied to foreign terrorist organizations who procured their U.S. citizenship by fraud, we will initiate denaturalization proceedings–whether you reside here or abroad–and ensure you are denied entry into the United States,” Sessions said in a statement. (RELATED: Sessions Warns Incoming Illegal Immigrants: ‘Don’t Come’)
Howell’s order is the final step in a process initiated by federal authorities in 2015. DOJ was seeking the revocation of Dahab’s U.S. citizenship on the grounds that he lied during his naturalization proceedings and hid the fact that he was a member of an international terrorist group.
In addition to his recruiting activities, Dahab admitted to attending a training camp near Jalalabad, Afghanistan, where he taught foreign fighters to fly hang gliders in preparation for terrorist attacks. He facilitated from Santa Clara the transfer of fake passports, documents, and money that materially supported terrorist attacks in Egypt and Pakistan, DOJ officials said.
Dahab was naturalized on Feb. 7, 1997. He traveled to Egypt the next year and was arrested by Egyptian authorities on terrorism-related charges.
He was later convicted and sentenced to a 15-year prison term.",1

REUTERS/Nate Raymond
The move marks the latest skirmish over immigration between President Donald Trump’s administration and local governments who have resisted his crackdown. The state’s Democratic attorney general called the charges “politically motivated.” The charges target Massachusetts District Court Judge Shelley Joseph, 51, and Massachusetts Trial Court Officer Wesley MacGregor, 56. They focus on an April 2018 hearing in Newton District Court, outside Boston, where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer intended to arrest an unidentified suspected illegal immigrant from the Dominican Republic facing a drug charge. They described a huddled conversation between the judge and the defendant’s lawyer in which Joseph asks, “ICE is gonna get him?” and later says, “I’m not gonna allow them to come in here.” She then arranged for the suspect to be released through the court’s rear door while the ICE agent waited in the courtroom’s lobby for him to emerge. Massachusetts U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling, a Trump appointee, said the case was not intended to send a political message. “We did not bring this case in response to the public debate over immigration enforcement,” he said. State Attorney General Maura Healey rejected that assertion. “Today’s indictment is a radical and politically-motivated attack on our state and the independence of our courts,” Healey said in a statement. Representatives of the judge and court officer did not respond to requests for comment. The state Supreme Judicial Court suspended Joseph without pay, but said its move “in no way reflects any opinion on the merits of the pending criminal case.” The charges carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. The suspect has since been caught and is now in federal custody. Massachusetts’ top court in 2017 ruled that state police cannot detain illegal immigrants solely to buy time for federal officials to take them into custody. One of Trump’s top priorities in office has been cracking down on illegal and legal immigration and he has regularly railed against “sanctuary” cities and states that do not cooperate with all aspects of federal immigration enforcement. Trump earlier this month floated the idea of busing undocumented migrants stopped at the border to “sanctuary cities,” a move critics called illustrative of a callous approach to the issue and some Trump allies called impractical.",0
2505,"Reuters","Nur Hasan al Faraj's already slim hopes of a new life in the United States have all but died since she heard that President Donald Trump would temporarily ban refugees coming from some Muslim states.
Her flight from the civil war in Syria has taken her only as far as the southern Turkish city of Hatay near the border with her homeland.
Like other Syrians, Iraqis and Yemenis who spoke to OutletName on Wednesday, Faraj was alarmed by media reports that Trump will impose a temporary ban on most refugees and suspend visas for citizens of Syria and six other countries.
The reports have heightened fears that a new era of hostility from the West is dawning, she and other refugees said.
""This reflects the hateful point of view of America, it reflects enmity, in fact it reflected enmity to all humanity,"" Faraj said outside an immigration office in Hatay where dozens of refugees were queuing in the hope of obtaining a Turkish residence permit.
Asked if she would like to go to the United States, Faraj said: ""If there had been such a possibility before, yes, I would like to have gone. But now, after Trump has come, no, I think I will never go.""
Faraj, who wore a brightly colored headscarf and black coat, said she hoped relatives who have already reached the United States would return ""because staying there would be a terrible thing"".
Abdulhalim Bekro, a Syrian man who stood nearby, was also concerned by what he depicted as a worsening mood against refugees in the United States.
""Everyone in the world knows that this decision contains hatred. This hatred is not limited to seven countries,"" he said.
""I definitely do not think of going (to the United States), not under Trump's administration, nor the previous, because they are all of the same mentality.""
Before becoming president, Trump proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, which he said would protect Americans from jihadist attacks. He later said the focus would be placed on restrictions on countries whose migrants could pose a threat, rather than a ban on those of a specific religion.
Such moves could affect millions of refugees fleeing civil wars and political or religious oppression.
""I was hoping God would let me see my sister again. But now the situation became very difficult. Certainly this decision is not at all humane,"" said Barsha, a Syrian refugee in Lebanon whose sister now lives in the U.S. state of New Jersey.Holders of passports from the seven countries affected already face severe restrictions on travel to the United States.
""It was difficult in the first place, and now Trump is in power it has become impossible,"" said Abdulhamid Zughbi, a Syrian refugee in Lebanon.
One Iraqi refugee, an engineer living in the Burj al-Barajneh camp in Lebanon, said his application to join his parents in the United States was still under consideration but that he now expected it would be rejected.
The United States has taken about 12,000 Syrian refugees compared to 2.8 million who are now in Turkey, approximately a million in Lebanon and 650,000 in Jordan. More than 650,000 Syrians have arrived in Europe and requested asylum, mostly in Germany and Sweden, EU figures show.
The perceived difficulty of reaching the United States, including a long visa application process that involves extensive interviews and paperwork, has dissuaded many Syrians and people from other Middle East from even seeking to do so.
Islamist attacks in Europe and the United States, mostly carried out by Muslims already resident in the West, has boosted support among Americans for Trump's position.
But some Syrian refugees said Trump's stance had reinforced the impression among them that he is opposed to Muslims. They disputed the idea that Syrian refugees posed a militant threat.
""Trump's pretext is a fear that there could be terrorists among migrants. This is a lie,"" said Rami Halloum, another refugee in Lebanon.",0
2377,"USA Today","Thomas Homan, who has headed President Trump's efforts to ramp up immigration arrests and crack down on so-called sanctuary cities, announced on Monday that he is leaving the administration and retiring.
Homan was one of Trump's first appointments in January 2017, tapped to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as its agents were ordered to round up more undocumented immigrants living throughout the U.S. Homan did just that, increasing the number of arrests in his first year, and winning repeated praise from Trump.
But Homan has been serving as an interim director, with Trump only nominating him to permanently lead the agency in November. Homan has been facing a difficult road to Senate confirmation over his agency's aggressive enforcement actions, its battles with local governments over their role in immigration enforcement, and the increase of arrests of undocumented immigrants without a criminal record.
Eighteen Democratic senators sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security last week, asking why the administration took nearly 10 months to officially nominate an ICE director. And they asked why the department had not answered its questions of Homan’s handling of ICE, when the agency was ""making radical – and in some cases possibly illegal – changes in immigration enforcement and practices.""
“We understand that the Trump Administration may be concerned about Mr. Homan answering questions under oath about his leadership of ICE, as well as the possibility that Mr. Homan’s nomination could be defeated in the Senate,” the senators wrote.
The agency said Homan had been planning to retire for months, and stayed only at the request of John Kelly, the president's chief of staff and former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. In a statement, Homan called his decision to retire ""bittersweet"" but long overdue after 34 years working for the federal government.
""I am humbled and inspired by the 20,000 American patriots who serve this agency and protect our nation, increasingly in the face of unfair and false criticism from politicians and the media,"" Homan said. ""Because of their tremendous dedication and hard work, we have made significant progress this past year in enforcing our nation’s immigration and customs laws, and in protecting public safety and national security.""
Homan led what has been the biggest change in immigration under the Trump administration. The president's travel ban has been stuck in the courts for months, and his signature border wall has not been built because Congress, and Mexico, have been unwilling to pay for it.
But through ICE arrests, Trump has been able to increase immigration enforcement unilaterally with no changes needed from Congress.
Trump long complained that former President Obama placed too many restrictions on ICE agents, only allowing them to target undocumented immigrants with criminal records and other national security concerns. Trump was able to reverse that by issuing presidential memorandum that ""unshackled"" ICE agents.
Homan implemented that quickly, issuing a set of directives that made virtually all of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants potential targets for arrest.
Over the first few months of the Trump administration, total arrests were up, including those of undocumented immigrants who only had immigration violations on their record. ICE agents have been targeting more worksites, where they are targeting both undocumented workers and business owners who hire them.
Homan also was one of the administration's most vocal critics of so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" local governments that limit their cooperation with federal immigration agents. Homan has been especially critical of leaders in California, who have fought back hard against the president's enforcement actions.",0
