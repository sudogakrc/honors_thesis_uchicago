441,"U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers apprehended a Mexican citizen on Friday who is wanted in Texas for sexual assault of a young girl. The fugitive Mexican national has an outstanding warrant for sexual-assault-continuous sexual abuse of a victim under the age of 14 years. The man attempted to enter the U.S. while traveling on a commercial bus.
Forty-one-year-old Martin Gerardo Perez Garcia tried to re-enter the country at the Texas-Mexican border through the Laredo Port of Entry.
Dallas County Sheriff’s Office previously filed a warrant for Perez Garcia’s arrest following the allegations of sexual assault and continuous sexual abuse of a young girl. U.S. Custom and Border Protection (CBP) officers discovered the warrant utilizing their law enforcement databases. Officers also confirmed it through biometric verification searches.
Officers apprehended Perez Garcia at the Juarez-Lincoln International Bridge.
“Our CBP officers are committed to the CBP mission, and one of their responsibilities is to identify fugitives at our ports of entry and returning them to face justice for the crimes they have committed,” said Port Director Albert Flores, Laredo Port of Entry.
“When we encounter persons wanted by other law enforcement agencies, we verify the warrant and then carry out the appropriate law enforcement action.”
This is not an uncommon situation for CBP officers.
On January 28, CBP officers in Laredo apprehended a U.S. citizen attempting to enter Texas via the Laredo Port of Entry by bus. A records check on 67-year-old Gabriel Galvan Rodriguez revealed the man had an outstanding warrant from Marion County, Oregon, according to information obtained from CBP officials by OutletName Texas. A court in Marion County issues the warrant for charges of sexual abuse, officials stated. CBP officers turned the man over to Webb County Sheriff’s Office deputies who transported him to the county jail pending extradition proceedings.
In April 2017, CPB officers arrested a 48-year-old Mexican national attempting to flee prosecution in Oregon by absconding to Mexico, OutletName Texas reported. Officers arrested Santiago Flores-Martinez, a previously deported criminal alien, at the San Ysidro port of entry after learning of a warrant from Clackamas County, Oregon. After his return to Oregon, a jury convicted Flores-Martinez on the charge of sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl. Immigration officials previously deported the man in 2001.
His sentencing hearing is scheduled for Monday.
According to a report by the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) entitled “Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,” 6,951 criminal aliens have been booked into Texas jails for sexual assault charges between June 1, 2011, and January 31, 2018. Of those, 3,207 have been convicted.

1859,"In 2013, after months of drafting, hearings and debate, the United States Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill by the staggering vote of 68-32.
OutletNameNews, including Trump guru Sean Hannity, provided the political space for Republicans to join Democrats.
The bill died because then-Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) was more concerned with his own job as Speaker than he was in solving a problem for 12 million residents, and for society as a whole. He would not allow a vote on the bill. Current-Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) favored the bill.
Other than feeding at the public trough, nothing is as important to Trump as his wall. In an attempt to make it more palatable, he even suggest installing solar panels on it.
Give it to him. In exchange just pass the ’13 bill. It has already been completely vetted and debated in the Senate. It went through “regular order”, unlike anything the Republican Congress has tried to do.
Indeed, amend the ’13 bill to include the wall and $18 billion, and the legislation is done.
Trump would go for it. He has no capacity to resist instant gratification.
If Trump goes for it, will the House balk again? Many Republicans will vote against it, but the Speaker was for it a few years ago, and he is going to retire anyhow. Bring it to the floor, and there must be at least 30 Republicans who will vote for it because Trump wants it.
Are 30 Republicans going to deny Trump his greatest victory? I think not.
Do I mind giving Trump a victory? Yes, because he is unfit to be president, and this may make it more difficult to get rid of him. But, that is very hard to weigh, and the need to resolve status for 12 million of our residents is too compelling.
Moreover, his crimes are quite separate from this.
Chuck&Nancy should trundle over to the White House with this proposal. They should emphasize (and show Trump the clips) that Hannity supported the principle. They should wrap it in all the superlatives—biggest, best, most historic—that Trump loves hearing and, in this case, would have the unique (for Trump) virtue of being true.

926,"The immigration court backlog now exceeds 1 million cases, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which tracks immigration court data. Immigration courts, which fall under the Justice Department and decide whether to deport immigrants, have been bogged down over the years as more cases are added to the docket that can be addressed at any given time. “If nothing else, the continuing rise of the backlog shows that the immigration court is broken,” said Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. “Until we fix the design defect of having a court in a law enforcement agency, we will not be able to address the backlog in a fair and effective manner.” President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the nation’s immigration system, specifically taking issue with the practice of releasing immigrants while they await their court dates. To remedy that, his administration has sought to hire more immigration judges in the hopes of unclogging the court. Even so, the number of cases has continued to tick upward. During the last partial government shutdown, for example, the only cases that moved forward were those of immigrants in detention. All others were postponed. In January, the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse estimated that more than 42,000 immigration court hearings had been canceled as a result of the shutdown – exacerbating an issue Trump had pledged to resolve. “The latest case-by-case court records through the end of August 2019 show the court’s active case backlog was 1,007,155,” according to the clearinghouse’s report released Wednesday. “If the additional 322,535 cases which the court says are pending but have not been placed on the active caseload rolls are added, then the backlog now tops 1.3 million.” While a Justice Department spokesman said in a statement to OutletName that the department “does not certify data from third parties,” the spokesman added: “This report and DOJ’s own data further confirms there is a crisis at the border. This Administration is taking aggressive steps to increase productivity, close loopholes, and hire a record number of judges to address the backlog with our existing authorities.” While the clearinghouse doesn’t attribute the backlog to any one factor, the American Bar Association has previously proposed a major overhaul of the US immigration system, calling the courts “irredeemably dysfunctional.” “The state of the U.S. immigration court system has worsened considerably since our 2010 Report,” that March report noted, mentioning an unprecedented backlog of cases, increased wait times, policy changes that aim to accelerate cases without allocating enough funding, overreliance on video teleconferencing during court proceedings and possible bias in the hiring of judges. The Justice Department had previously addressed some of the issues the bar association report raised. The administration has acknowledged the massive immigration court backlog and has, at times, placed blame on unfounded asylum claims, which have to work their way through their court system. This month, the administration opened tent courts along the Texas border to hear the cases of migrants who have been returned to Mexico to await their immigration proceedings as part of the Migrant Protection Protocols program. Around 42,000 migrants have been sent back under the program. In Wednesday’s report, the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse notes that the Migrant Protection Protocols cases still make up a small share of the court’s active backlog.",1
786,"OutletName’s Jim Acosta traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border in McAllen, Texas, on Thursday to cover the presidential visit to the border town. As Acosta awaited the president, he took a selfie video walking along the border, and inadvertently made a case for the construction of a border wall.
In the video, Acosta wanders around steel slats on the border, describing how “tranquil” it is. “I found some steel slats down on the border. But I don’t see anything resembling a national emergency situation,” Acosta tweeted.
I found some steel slats down on the border. But I don’t see anything resembling a national emergency situation.. at least not in the McAllen TX area of the border where Trump will be today. 
“We’re not seeing any imminent danger,” Acosta said in the video. “There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence. No sign of the national emergency the president has been talking about.”
Conservatives on Twitter pounced on the tweet.
So you went down to the border and found that there is no national emergency situation where steel slats have been erected? Good own. 
Er, you found a place where there is a barrier and all is quiet? Jim, do you know what point you’re actually making here? 
Jim Acosta just posted one of the biggest self owns ever. He’s walking along the border where there’s a wall in place talking about how there’s nothing that “resembles a national emergency situation” and “there’s no migrants trying to rush.” That’s because there’s a wall, Jim. ://t.co/qkuWRhxolW — Caleb Hull () January 10, 2019

Acosta also tagged the video location as filmed at a Burger King, which he explained in a subsequent tweet. “The Burger King is literally down hill from where we shot this (for folks who are wondering – why it shows up)” The Trump border visit comes amid a partial government shutdown over funding for border security, as Democratic congressional leaders refuse to give the White House its requested funding for a border wall.",0
1903,"OutletName’s Jake Tapper has slammed President Donald Trump for building a “wall of misinformation” around the issue of border security.
Trump’s promise to make Mexico pay for a wall along the southern U.S. border became a key issue in his election campaign. However, the president has consistently propagated various lies about the wall, including his sensationalist claim that former presidents support its construction.
The OutletName host remarked that Trump had built nothing more than a “wall of lies” around the entire issue.
“There may be no issue where the president and his administration have been more misleading than on the subject of immigration,” he said.
“Trump’s own senior administration officials privately acknowledge that the continued spreading of falsehoods about this issue has created a real problem as the president takes to the mound and prepares to make his pitch,” Tapper later added.",1
586,"Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has taken to social media to denounce the executive order signed by President Donald J. Trump calling for the construction of a border wall and stronger security. Peña Nieto said that Mexico will not pay for the project.
During a short message that was posted on his Facebook page and a video message sent via Twitter, Pena Nieto informed his countrymen about the executive orders that would be focusing on immigration and the wall.
Un mensaje para todos los mexicanos: pic.twitter.com/EFcNh7fQtm — Enrique Peña Nieto () January 26, 2017
“As a response, I have ordered Mexico’s Foreign Ministry to redouble the protection measures to our countrymen,” Peña Nieto said. “The 50 Mexican Consulates in the U.S. will be turned into authentic defenders of the rights of migrants.”
Peña Nieto called on civil rights groups and legislators to team up and provide support for the protection measures.
“Where there is one Mexican migrant in risk that requires our support, that is where we need to be … that is where his country needs to be,” the Mexican president said.
During his message, Peña Nieto called out the executive order for the border wall claiming that it divides the two countries rather than unites them, especially at a time when trade and border security are top bilateral matters of discussion.
“Mexico does not believe in walls,” he said. “I have said it time and time again; Mexico will not pay for a wall.”
In his speech, Peña Nieto made no mention of the various Mexican drug cartels that have been responsible for the out-of-control violence along the border and the related human and drug trafficking. As OutletName Texas has reported, Mexican drug cartels have been protected by government officials at the highest levels, including two former border governors, that are current fugitives of the U.S. Department of Justice.

985,"Rep. Terry Canales heard the reports of children suffering in squalid conditions at Customs and Border Protection facilities and knew what he had to do. The Texas state legislator sent a letter to local Border Patrol officials asking what items members of the public could donate. Canales says the response he received baffled him. “We don’t accept donations,” the email from a Border Patrol representative said, according to Canales. “It just befuddles me and I think it’s just heartbreaking to know that there’s so many people that want to help, and that help is being denied for no definable reasons that anybody’s been able to communicate,” Canales told OutletName on Tuesday. Two people who attempted to donate items at a Texas facility this week also told OutletName their items weren’t accepted. The situation, first reported by The Texas Tribune, has left would-be donors scratching their heads and drawn criticism from Canales and others who accuse the federal government of letting red tape get in the way of human decency. Why wouldn’t the agency accept donations? CBP officials said Tuesday that they aren’t running low on supplies, but are looking into whether they can accept donations in the future. And a former CBP official told OutletName it would be illegal for the agency to accept donations from the public. Here’s a deeper look at the issues in play: CBP: ‘We’re not running low on those things’
On a call with reporters Tuesday, a CBP official said that the agency is working with its lawyers to see whether it can accept donations in the future. Asked about reports that donations of hygiene products were not being accepted by CBP, the official said the agency isn’t running low on such supplies. “We’re using operational funding to provide those things. But those things are available now and they have been continuously,” he said. “So we are looking at the possibility of using some of those donations going forward. But those items, it’s important to note, are available now.” Last week a team of doctors, lawyers and advocates warned of what they said were major health and hygiene problems at several CBP facilities in Texas. Members of the team of monitors told OutletName the conditions they witnessed were “unconscionable,” noting a lack of soap and restrictions on how often children could shower. Separately, a Justice Department lawyer argued last week that detained migrant children don’t need toothbrushes, soap and blankets in order to be held in “safe and sanitary conditions,” as a court settlement requires. Both the monitors’ findings and widely circulated reports of the Trump administration’s recent legal argument have spurred widespread criticism – and increased interest in donating items to kids in US government custody. A CBP official told reporters Tuesday that the agency takes any allegations of abuse seriously, but also cautioned that some allegations the monitors raised are vague and difficult to investigate. “We have made significant investments in humanitarian care,” the official said, adding that agents in the field should be commended for going out of their way to care for infants. The high numbers of migrants crossing the border is a crisis, the official said, “and we’re doing the best we can do deal with it.” Former CBP adviser: Accepting donations would be illegal
Theresa Cardinal Brown says there’s one clear reason why CBP wouldn’t be accepting donations. “The short answer is it’s against the law,” says Brown, who worked for CBP as a policy adviser from 2005-2007 and now is the head of immigration and cross-border policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. The law in question, Brown says, is known as the Antideficiency Act. “That law is a law passed by Congress that says the government cannot accept goods and services without remuneration. Because it cannot spend or use things that have not been appropriated to it by Congress,” Brown said. “If (CBP) was able to accept donations outside of that it would be overspending what it was authorized to spend.” In addition, Brown said ethical considerations would come up “if the executive gets to decide from whom it gets to accept donations and for what.” She cited the recent example of a GoFundMe border wall fundraiser, which began as an effort to raise money to donate to CBP. “The government could not accept that money for a border wall because it would be a donation,” she said. Would-be donors say when they went to Border Patrol facility’s door, no one answered
Gabriel Acuña headed to the dollar store and stocked up on supplies to donate over the weekend. But he was surprised to see there was no one at the Border Patrol facility in his hometown of Clint, Texas, to accept the bars of soap, tubes of toothpaste and packets of toothbrushes he’d purchased. The door was locked, he said, and the lobby was empty. “Obviously the community wants to help out,” Acuña told OutletName’s Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday. “Let the community get involved, if anybody higher up in terms of the administration or likewise in government is not able to do so.” Austin Savage says he and a group of friends had a similar experience when they went to the Clint facility over the weekend with diapers and other supplies they’d brought to donate. “The facility itself was shut down. We rang the intercom buzzer, to no response, and we called the help line posted on the window, to no response. The only activity was vehicles moving in and out from the facility through an electronic sliding gate,” he said. “The agents in the vehicles saw us, clearly, and in some cases stopped the vehicle to stare back, but no one interacted with us.” Lawmaker: Any policy and security reasons ‘can be overcome’
Canales said he spoke with Border Patrol representatives this week, but wasn’t given an explanation as to why donations weren’t being accepted. “We had a semi-productive conversation with respect to what was happening, and the (Rio Grande sector) chief seemed to be receptive to trying to come to some sort of arrangement wherein he could accept donations. So the lines of communication are open,” Canales said. “But the reality is Border Patrol is overwhelmed, and whether they’ve got the monetary funding to provide the resources and whether they can provide the resources are two different things.” The federal government, he said, has been too slow to act. “To say that you don’t have the adequate resources, yet we’re going to turn down resources that are being offered for free, is derelict,” he said. “I understand there can be some policy reasons and security reasons, but these reasons can be overcome.”",1
256,"President Trump said Tuesday that a “drone flying around” will not stop the new migrant caravan that is moving from Central America toward the U.S. border with Mexico, doubling down on his claims that “Only a Wall will work.”
“A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras. Tell Nancy and Chuck that a drone flying around will not stop them. Only a Wall will work. Only a Wall, or Steel Barrier, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!” Trump tweeted early Tuesday.
The president’s tweet comes on day 25 of the partial government shutdown, which has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors without pay. The shutdown began on Dec. 22, over a border security funding battle between the White House and congressional Democrats, led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
NEW MIGRANT CARAVAN LEAVES HONDURAS FOR JOURNEY TO US BORDER
The president requested $5.7 billion in funding toward border security and construction of a wall or physical barrier along the border, while Democrats vowed to block any request for wall funding.
Last week, the president mentioned the new caravan and said “we’re trying to break it up.” But the caravan of at least 500 migrants began its journey from Honduras to the U.S. border late Monday, members of the group told OutletName.
The caravan left the northern city of San Pedro Sula earlier than expected. The group consists of a mix of people that included some mothers carrying their young children on their shoulders. As they walked, some migrants pleaded with local store owners to give them food or water for their journey, according to The Associated Press.
TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON BORDER WALL, AS POLLS SHOW VOTERS TURNING AGAINST HIS SHUTDOWN STRATEGY
The president has continued to sound the alarm over the immigration flow along the border, saying that it amounts to an “invasion,” and called it “far worse” than people understand after he visited the front-lines in Texas last week. Trump has repeatedly called it a “humanitarian crisis”—one that Democrats have claimed he “manufactured.”
Meanwhile, the president has continued to say the public is with him as he tries to shift blame for the shutdown to the Democrats.
“Democrats will soon be known as the Party of Crime. Ridiculous that they don’t want Border Security!” Trump tweeted Tuesday.
But as more than 800,000 federal workers missed their first paychecks, fresh polling suggests the president is losing the battle of public opinion.
A Quinnipiac University poll released Monday found that 63 percent of voters agree with the Democratic proposal to reopen parts of the government that do not involve border security, with 30 percent opposed. The same poll founded 63 percent also oppose using the shutdown to force wall funding, with just 32 percent supporting.
The poll found that 56 percent of American voters blame Trump and Republicans in Congress for the partial shutdown, compared with 36 percent who say Democrats are responsible.
Neither side is showing any sign of budging, with Trump continuing to insist on upwards of nearly $6 billion for a border wall and Democratic leaders saying they will not entertain a wall in this spending package.

927,"They number upwards of 250,000. They’ve lived legally in the United States for nearly two decades. And now, they have less than two years to leave, find another legal way to stay or face deportation. The Department of Homeland Security announced Monday it is ending “temporary protected status” for Salvadorans. The decision, hailed by immigration hardliners and slammed by immigrant rights groups, left thousands of people shaken and uncertain about their families’ futures. “After 17 years of a normal life, everything just vanished,” said Cristian Chavez, 37. An IT worker in Houston, Texas, Chavez told reporters Monday he wasn’t sure what he’d do next. “I feel lost,” he said. “It’s like all my plans for the future are just dead.” As officials explain their decision and activists push for Congress to step in, here’s a look at some of the key events and issues at play: It started with an earthquake.
The 7.7-magnitude quake that struck El Salvador in January 2001 was the worst to hit the country in a decade. Then, two powerful quakes shook the country the following month. Neighborhoods were buried. Homes collapsed. More than 1,100 people were killed. Another 1.3 million were displaced. The devastation spurred a decision that March by then-US Attorney General John Ashcroft: Immigrants from El Salvador who’d been in the United States since February 2001 could apply for temporary protected status, or TPS, which would protect them from deportation and allow them to get work permits. It was an 18-month designation. Now, it’s been nearly 17 years. Time after time, officials from different administrations determined that conditions in El Salvador hadn’t improved enough for migrants with TPS to return. On Monday, the Trump administration said it decided to end protections effective September 9, 2019. Some 400,000 affected?
Estimates differ for exactly how many immigrants the decision will affect. There were 263,282 Salvadoran TPS beneficiaries at the end of 2016, according to the latest statistics provided to OutletName by US Citizenship and Immigration Services. Activists and experts have put the number of Salvadorans who could lose protections closer to 200,000, noting that official statistics likely include people who are no longer in the program because their immigration status has changed or they have left the United States. There’s also another group experts say will be affected: nearly 200,000 US citizen children of Salvadoran parents with TPS. “Our family will break apart. … What am I going to do now?” said Chavez, who is raising two stepchildren and a cousin in Houston. “How can I tell them that I have to go?” Immigrant rights advocates say it is unfair and cruel to end TPS for Salvadorans who’ve built lives, paid taxes, contributed to the economy and raised families for nearly two decades in the United States. They also argue that violence and widespread poverty make it unsafe for migrants to return to El Salvador. Those who support ending TPS for Salvadorans and other immigrants, such as the Federation for American Immigration Reform, say there’s a reason the designation was referred to as “temporary” and argue that conditions in El Salvador are good enough for migrants to return. Salvadoran immigration to the US has a long history.
El Salvador is about the size of New Jersey. And it’s nearly 2,000 miles from Washington. But the small country of 6.2 million people has become a big deal in the US immigration debate. Even before the earthquakes, Salvadoran immigrants had been streaming into the United States. A major driver: the country’s civil war, which lasted from 1980 to 1992. Experts estimate the conflict sent more than 25% of El Salvador’s residents fleeing for their lives. More than 330,000 Salvadorans came to the United States between 1985 and 1990, according to the Migration Policy Institute. And in recent years, while immigration from Mexico has slowed, the rate of immigration from El Salvador and other Central American countries has been on the rise. About 465,000 of the Salvadoran immigrants living in the United States are undocumented, according to an estimate from the Migration Policy Institute. In the last five years, more than 58,000 unaccompanied minors from El Salvador were apprehended at the US-Mexico border, according to US Customs and Border Protection. And in the last fiscal year, which ended in September, more than 24,000 Salvadoran parents and children traveling together were apprehended at the border. El Salvador’s murder rate is one of the highest in the world, and experts have said poverty and violence were major factors fueling the recent migration wave. MS-13: A new Public Enemy No. 1
The Trump administration has repeatedly tied the youth apprehended at the border to the notorious Mara Salvatrucha gang, known as MS-13. And Trump frequently invokes MS-13 as he vows to step up immigration enforcement. MS-13 is strongest in Central America, especially El Salvador. But the gang actually began in Los Angeles in the 1980s, during another wave of Salvadoran migration. Analysts say its offshoots in Central America took hold when members were deported by the US. Immigrant rights groups say it’s misleading to use MS-13 as an excuse for any crackdown and note that many of the gang’s victims are immigrants. In a class action lawsuit filed last year, the ACLU accused the administration of using unsubstantiated claims of gang affiliation to detain and deport immigrant teens. In 2017, more than 1,200 people with suspected gang ties were deported to El Salvador, according to migration officials there. That’s more than double the number of suspected gang members deported to El Salvador in 2016. While MS-13 and TPS are separate issues, some see the Trump administration’s escalation in tough talk about the gang as a bellwether for officials’ approach toward the region. El Salvador relies on money from immigrants.
Officials in the Central American country painted the Trump administration’s announcement Monday as a victory, with President Salvador Sánchez Cerén taking to Twitter to praise what he described as the “extension” of TPS until September 2019. But ending TPS for Salvadorans could be a big blow to El Salvador’s economy. Trump clamps down on El Salvador’s ‘lifeline’ Remittances, the money immigrants send home, make up more than 17% of El Salvador’s GDP. Most of that money, experts say, comes from Salvadorans living in the United States. And Salvadoran officials have taken note. “Ending TPS will be catastrophic for El Salvador’s economy,” Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez wrote in a recent op-ed, “because it will add more deportees to the ranks of the unemployed and eliminate the remittances, which support many families in El Salvador.” This isn’t the first – or last – time you’ll hear about TPS.
Congress created TPS in 1990 as a form of humanitarian relief for people who would face extreme hardship if forced to return to homelands devastated by armed conflict and natural disasters. Currently, about 437,000 people from 10 countries have TPS, according to the Congressional Research Service, but tens of thousands will lose that protection in the coming years. Salvadorans are just the latest group whose TPS designation is on the chopping block. Last month, the Trump administration announced that in July 2019 it would end TPS for more than 50,000 Haitians who sought refuge in the United States after a catastrophic earthquake hit that country in 2010. Last year, officials also announced that TPS for Nicaraguan and Sudanese immigrants would end. Honduran immigrants got a brief reprieve in November, when the Department of Homeland Security postponed its decision about how to handle the roughly 86,000 people with TPS from that Central American nation, triggering an automatic six-month extension. But later this year, that decision will once again be up for review. This year officials will also have to decide whether to extend TPS for Nepal, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. The Trump administration extended TPS for South Sudan last year and will reconsider the issue again in 2019. Some activists are also pushing for Congress to come up with a more permanent solution. A bill introduced last year would give people with TPS an opportunity to apply to become permanent US residents. This story has been updated to reflect Monday’s decision and add more detail about why some experts and activists say fewer Salvadorans would be affected.",1
1526,"Late to his own meeting and waving a sheet of numbers, President Trump stormed into the Oval Office one day in June, plainly enraged. Five months before, Mr. Trump had dispatched federal officers to the nation’s airports to stop travelers from several Muslim countries from entering the United States in a dramatic demonstration of how he would deliver on his campaign promise to fortify the nation’s borders. But so many foreigners had flooded into the country since January, he vented to his national security team, that it was making a mockery of his pledge. Friends were calling to say he looked like a fool, Mr. Trump said. According to six officials who attended or were briefed about the meeting, Mr. Trump then began reading aloud from the document, which his domestic policy adviser, Stephen Miller, had given him just before the meeting. The document listed how many immigrants had received visas to enter the United States in 2017. More than 2,500 were from Afghanistan, a terrorist haven, the president complained. Haiti had sent 15,000 people. They “all have AIDS,” he grumbled, according to one person who attended the meeting and another person who was briefed about it by a different person who was there. Forty thousand had come from Nigeria, Mr. Trump added. Once they had seen the United States, they would never “go back to their huts” in Africa, recalled the two officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss a sensitive conversation in the Oval Office. As the meeting continued, John F. Kelly, then the secretary of homeland security, and Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, tried to interject, explaining that many were short-term travelers making one-time visits. But as the president continued, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Miller turned their ire on Mr. Tillerson, blaming him for the influx of foreigners and prompting the secretary of state to throw up his arms in frustration. If he was so bad at his job, maybe he should stop issuing visas altogether, Mr. Tillerson fired back. Tempers flared and Mr. Kelly asked that the room be cleared of staff members. But even after the door to the Oval Office was closed, aides could still hear the president berating his most senior advisers. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, denied on Saturday morning that Mr. Trump had made derogatory statements about immigrants during the meeting. “General Kelly, General McMaster, Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Nielsen and all other senior staff actually in the meeting deny these outrageous claims,” she said, referring to the current White House chief of staff, the national security adviser and the secretaries of state and homeland security. “It’s both sad and telling OutletName would print the lies of their anonymous ‘sources’ anyway.” While the White House did not deny the overall description of the meeting, officials strenuously insisted that Mr. Trump never used the words “AIDS” or “huts” to describe people from any country. Several participants in the meeting told Times reporters that they did not recall the president using those words and did not think he had, but the two officials who described the comments found them so noteworthy that they related them to others at the time. The meeting in June reflects Mr. Trump’s visceral approach to an issue that defined his campaign and has indelibly shaped the first year of his presidency. Seizing on immigration as the cause of countless social and economic problems, Mr. Trump entered office with an agenda of symbolic but incompletely thought-out goals, the product not of rigorous policy debate but of emotionally charged personal interactions and an instinct for tapping into the nativist views of white working-class Americans. Like many of his initiatives, his effort to change American immigration policy has been executed through a disorderly and dysfunctional process that sought from the start to defy the bureaucracy charged with enforcing it, according to interviews with three dozen current and former administration officials, lawmakers and others close to the process, many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private interactions. But while Mr. Trump has been repeatedly frustrated by the limits of his power, his efforts to remake decades of immigration policy have gained increasing momentum as the White House became more disciplined and adept at either ignoring or undercutting the entrenched opposition of many parts of the government. The resulting changes have had far-reaching consequences, not only for the immigrants who have sought to make a new home in this country, but also for the United States’ image in the world. “We have taken a giant steamliner barreling full speed,” Mr. Miller said in a recent interview. “Slowed it, stopped it, begun to turn it around and started sailing in the other direction.” It is an assessment shared ruefully by Mr. Trump’s harshest critics, who see a darker view of the past year. Frank Sharry, the executive director of America’s Voice, a pro-immigration group, argues that the president’s immigration agenda is motivated by racism. “He’s basically saying, ‘You people of color coming to America seeking the American dream are a threat to the white people,’” said Mr. Sharry, an outspoken critic of the president. “He’s come into office with an aggressive strategy of trying to reverse the demographic changes underway in America.” A Pledge With Appeal
Those who know Mr. Trump say that his attitude toward immigrants long predates his entry into politics. “He’s always been fearful where other cultures are concerned and always had anxiety about food and safety when he travels,” said Michael D’Antonio, who interviewed him for the biography “The Truth About Trump.” “His objectification and demonization of people who are different has festered for decades.” Friends say Mr. Trump, a developer turned reality TV star, grew to see immigration as a zero-sum issue: What is good for immigrants is bad for America. In 2014, well before becoming a candidate, he tweeted: “Our government now imports illegal immigrants and deadly diseases. Our leaders are inept.” But he remained conflicted, viewing himself as benevolent and wanting to be liked by the many immigrants he employed. Over time, the anti-immigrant tendencies hardened, and two of his early advisers, Roger J. Stone Jr. and Sam Nunberg, stoked that sentiment. But it was Mr. Trump who added an anti-immigrant screed to his Trump Tower campaign announcement in June 2015 in New York City without telling his aides. “When do we beat Mexico at the border? They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity,” Mr. Trump ad-libbed. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems,” he continued. “They’re bringing drugs; they’re bringing crime; they’re rapists.” During his campaign, he pushed a false story about Muslims celebrating in Jersey City as they watched the towers fall after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York. He said illegal immigrants were like “vomit” crossing the border. And he made pledges that he clearly could not fulfill. “We will begin moving them out, Day 1,” he said at a rally in August  2016, adding, “My first hour in office, those people are gone.” Democrats and some Republicans recoiled, calling Mr. Trump’s messaging damaging and divisive. But for the candidate, the idea of securing the country against outsiders with a wall had intoxicating appeal, though privately, he acknowledged that it was a rhetorical device to whip up crowds when they became listless. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, whom Mr. Trump consults regularly on the matter, said it was not a stretch to attribute Mr. Trump’s victory to issues where Mr. Trump broke with a Republican establishment orthodoxy that had disappointed anti-immigrant conservatives for decades. “There’s no issue on which he was more unorthodox than on immigration,” Mr. Cotton said. Ban Restarts Enforcement
Mr. Trump came into office with a long list of campaign promises that included not only building the wall (and making Mexico pay for it), but creating a “deportation force,” barring Muslims from entering the country and immediately deporting millions of immigrants with criminal records. Mr. Miller and other aides had the task of turning those promises into a policy agenda that would also include an assault against a pro-immigration bureaucracy they viewed with suspicion and disdain. Working in secret, they drafted a half-dozen executive orders. One would crack down on so-called sanctuary cities. Another proposed changing the definition of a criminal alien so that it included people arrested — not just those convicted. But mindful of his campaign promise to quickly impose “extreme vetting,” Mr. Trump decided his first symbolic action would be an executive order to place a worldwide ban on travel from nations the White House considered compromised by terrorism. With no policy experts in place, and deeply suspicious of career civil servants they regarded as spies for President Barack Obama, Mr. Miller and a small group of aides started with an Obama-era law that identified seven terror-prone “countries of concern.” And then they skipped practically every step in the standard White House playbook for creating and introducing a major policy. The National Security Council never convened to consider the travel ban proposal. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary at the time, did not see it ahead of time. Lawyers and policy experts at the White House, the Justice Department and the Homeland Security Department were not asked to weigh in. There were no talking points for friendly surrogates, no detailed briefings for reporters or lawmakers, no answers to frequently asked questions, such as whether green card holders would be affected. The announcement of the travel ban on a Friday night, seven days after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, created chaotic scenes at the nation’s largest airports, as hundreds of people were stopped, and set off widespread confusion and loud protests. Lawyers for the government raced to defend the president’s actions against court challenges, while aides struggled to explain the policy to perplexed lawmakers the next night at a black-tie dinner. White House aides resorted to Google searches and frenzied scans of the United States Code to figure out which countries were affected. But for the president, the chaos was the first, sharp evidence that he could exert power over the bureaucracy he criticized on the campaign trail. “It’s working out very nicely,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office the next day. At a hastily called Saturday night meeting in the Situation Room, Mr. Miller told senior government officials that they should tune out the whining. Sitting at the head of the table, across from Mr. Kelly, Mr. Miller repeated what he told the president: This is what we wanted — to turn immigration enforcement back on. Mr. Kelly, who shared Mr. Trump’s views about threats from abroad, was nonetheless livid that his employees at homeland security had been called into action with no guidance or preparation. He told angry lawmakers that responsibility for the rollout was “all on me.” Privately, he told the White House, “That’s not going to happen again.” Forced to Back Down
Amid the turbulent first weeks, Mr. Trump’s attempt to bend the government’s immigration apparatus to his will began to take shape. The ban’s message of “keep out” helped drive down illegal border crossings as much as 70 percent, even without being formally put into effect. Immigration officers rounded up 41,318 undocumented immigrants during the president’s first 100 days, nearly a 40 percent increase. The Justice Department began hiring more immigration judges to speed up deportations. Officials threatened to hold back funds for sanctuary cities. The flow of refugees into the United States slowed. Mr. Trump “has taken the handcuffs off,” said Steven A. Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies, an advocacy group that favors more limits on immigration. Mr. Obama had been criticized by immigrant rights groups for excessive deportations, especially in his first term. But Mr. Camarota said that Mr. Trump’s approach was “a distinct change, to look at what is immigration doing to us, rather than what is the benefit for the immigrant.” The president, however, remained frustrated that the shift was not yielding results. By early March, judges across the country had blocked his travel ban. Immigrant rights activists were crowing that they had thwarted the new president. Even Mr. Trump’s own lawyers told him he had to give up on defending the ban. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and lawyers at the White House and Justice Department had decided that waging an uphill legal battle to defend the directive in the Supreme Court would fail. Instead, they wanted to devise a narrower one that could pass legal muster. The president, though, was furious about what he saw as backing down to politically correct adversaries. He did not want a watered-down version of the travel ban, he yelled at Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, as the issue came to a head on Friday, March 3, in the Oval Office. It was a familiar moment for Mr. Trump’s advisers. The president did not mind being told “no” in private, and would sometimes relent. But he could not abide a public turnabout, a retreat. At those moments, he often exploded at whoever was nearby. As Marine One waited on the South Lawn for Mr. Trump to begin his weekend trip to Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. McGahn insisted that administration lawyers had already promised the court that Mr. Trump would issue a new order. There was no alternative, he said. “This is bullshit,” the president responded. With nothing resolved, Mr. Trump, furious, left the White House. A senior aide emailed a blunt warning to a colleague waiting aboard Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland: “He’s coming in hot.” Already mad at Mr. Sessions, who the day before had recused himself in the Russia investigation, Mr. Trump refused to take his calls. Aides told Mr. Sessions he would have to fly down to Mar-a-Lago to plead with the president in person to sign the new order. Over dinner that night with Mr. Sessions and Mr. McGahn, Mr. Trump relented. When he was back in Washington, he signed the new order. It was an indication that he had begun to understand — or at least, begrudgingly accept — the need to follow a process. Still, one senior adviser later recalled never having seen a president so angry signing anything. Soft Spot for ‘Dreamers’
As a candidate, Mr. Trump had repeatedly contradicted himself about the deportations he would pursue, and whether he was opposed to any kind of path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. But he also courted conservative voters by describing an Obama-era policy as an illegal amnesty for the immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children. During the transition, his aides drafted an executive order to end the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. But the executive order was held back as the new president struggled with conflicted feelings about the young immigrants, known as Dreamers. “We’re going to take care of those kids,” Mr. Trump had pledged to Senator Richard J. Durbin during a private exchange at his Inauguration Day luncheon. The comment was a fleeting glimpse of the president’s tendency to seek approval from whoever might be sitting across from him, and the power that personal interactions have in shaping his views. In 2013, Mr. Trump met with a small group of Dreamers at Trump Tower, hoping to improve his standing with the Hispanic community. José Machado told Mr. Trump about waking up at the age of 15 to find his mother had vanished — deported, he later learned, back to Nicaragua. “Honestly,” Mr. Machado said of Mr. Trump, “he had no idea.” Mr. Trump appeared to be touched by the personal stories, and insisted that the Dreamers accompany him to his gift shop for watches, books and neckties to take home as souvenirs. In the elevator on the way down, he quietly nodded and said, “You convinced me.” Aware that the president was torn about the Dreamers, Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, quietly reached out in March to Mr. Durbin, who had championed legislation called the Dream Act to legalize the immigrants, to test the waters for a possible deal. After weeks of private meetings on Capitol Hill and telephone conversations with Mr. Durbin and Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican supportive of legalizing the Dreamers, Mr. Kushner invited them to dinner at the six-bedroom estate he shares with his wife, Ivanka Trump. But Mr. Durbin’s hope of a deal faded when he arrived to the house and saw who one of the guests would be. “Stephen Miller’s presence made it a much different experience than I expected,” Mr. Durbin said later. Confronting the ‘Deep State’
Even as the administration was engaged in a court battle over the travel ban, it began to turn its attention to another way of tightening the border — by limiting the number of refugees admitted each year to the United States. And if there was one “deep state” stronghold of Obama holdovers that Mr. Trump and his allies suspected of undermining them on immigration, it was the State Department, which administers the refugee program. At the department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, there was a sense of foreboding about a president who had once warned that any refugee might be a “Trojan horse” or part of a “terrorist army.” Mr. Trump had already used the travel ban to cut the number of allowable refugees admitted to the United States in 2017 to 50,000, a fraction of the 110,000 set by Mr. Obama. Now, Mr. Trump would have to decide the level for 2018. At an April meeting with top officials from the bureau in the West Wing’s Roosevelt Room, Mr. Miller cited statistics from the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies that indicated that resettling refugees in the United States was far costlier than helping them in their own region. Mr. Miller was visibly displeased, according to people present, when State Department officials pushed back, citing another study that found refugees to be a net benefit to the economy. He called the contention absurd and said it was exactly the wrong kind of thinking. But the travel ban had been a lesson for Mr. Trump and his aides on the dangers of dictating a major policy change without involving the people who enforce it. This time, instead of shutting out those officials, they worked to tightly control the process. In previous years, State Department officials had recommended a refugee level to the president. Now, Mr. Miller told officials the number would be determined by the Department of Homeland Security under a new policy that treated the issue as a security matter, not a diplomatic one. When he got word that the Office of Refugee Resettlement had drafted a 55-page report showing that refugees were a net positive to the economy, Mr. Miller swiftly intervened, requesting a meeting to discuss it. The study never made it to the White House; it was shelved in favor of a three-page list of all the federal assistance programs that refugees used. At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr. Trump cited the Center for Immigration Studies report, arguing that it was more cost-effective to keep refugees out than to bring them into the United States. “Uncontrolled migration,” Mr. Trump declared, “is deeply unfair to both the sending and receiving countries.” More Disciplined Approach
Cecilia Muñoz, who served as Mr. Obama’s chief domestic policy adviser, said she was alarmed by the speed with which Mr. Trump and his team have learned to put their immigration agenda into effect. “The travel ban was a case of bureaucratic incompetence,” she said. “They made rookie mistakes. But they clearly learned from that experience. For the moment, all of the momentum is in the direction of very ugly, very extreme, very harmful policies.” By year’s end, the chaos and disorganization that marked Mr. Trump’s earliest actions on immigration had given way to a more disciplined approach that yielded concrete results, steered in large part by Mr. Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general. As secretary of homeland security, he had helped unleash immigration officers who felt constrained under Mr. Obama. They arrested 143,000 people in 2017, a sharp uptick, and deported more than 225,000. Later, as White House chief of staff, Mr. Kelly quietly persuaded the president to drop his talk of Mexico paying for the wall. But he has advocated on behalf of the president’s restrictionist vision, defying his reputation as a moderator of Mr. Trump’s hard-line instincts. In September, a third version of the president’s travel ban was issued with little fanfare and new legal justifications. Then, Mr. Trump overruled objections from diplomats, capping refugee admissions at 45,000 for 2018, the lowest since 1986. In November, the president ended a humanitarian program that granted residency to 59,000 Haitians since a 2010 earthquake ravaged their country. As the new year approached, officials began considering a plan to separate parents from their children when families are caught entering the country illegally, a move that immigrant groups called draconian. At times, though, Mr. Trump has shown an openness to a different approach. In private discussions, he returns periodically to the idea of a “comprehensive immigration” compromise, though aides have warned him against using the phrase because it is seen by his core supporters as code for amnesty. During a fall dinner with Democratic leaders, Mr. Trump explored the possibility of a bargain to legalize Dreamers in exchange for border security. Mr. Trump even told Republicans recently that he wanted to think bigger, envisioning a deal early next year that would include a wall, protection for Dreamers, work permits for their parents, a shift to merit-based immigration with tougher work site enforcement, and ultimately, legal status for some undocumented immigrants. The idea would prevent Dreamers from sponsoring the parents who brought them illegally for citizenship, limiting what Mr. Trump refers to as “chain migration.” “He wants to make a deal,” said Mr. Graham, who spoke with Mr. Trump about the issue last week. “He wants to fix the entire system.” Yet publicly, Mr. Trump has only employed the absolutist language that defined his campaign and has dominated his presidency. After an Uzbek immigrant was arrested on suspicion of plowing a truck into a bicycle path in Lower Manhattan in October, killing eight people, the president seized on the episode. Privately, in the Oval Office, the president expressed disbelief about the visa program that had admitted the suspect, confiding to a group of visiting senators that it was yet another piece of evidence that the United States’ immigration policies were “a joke.” Even after a year of progress toward a country sealed off from foreign threats, the president still viewed the immigration system as plagued by complacency. “We’re so politically correct,” he complained to reporters in the cabinet room, “that we’re afraid to do anything.”",1
209,"A dozen people were arrested Monday after they attempted to enter the United States illegally from Mexico in a small makeshift boat that washed ashore in California, authorities said.
Firefighters examined those aboard after the panga boat – a type of small fishing vessel commonly used by smugglers – showed up off Huntington Beach about 2 p.m. Monday.

Immigration officials told FOX11 a concerned citizen spotted the makeshift boat off the coast and called in the tip. When the boat made landfall, about 100 miles north of the U.S.-Mexican border, everyone on board ran for shelter.
Authorities said the men and women were cold but uninjured.
Nine Chinese men, a Chinese woman, and two Mexican men were handed over to federal custody. One of the Mexican men is believed to be the smuggler.
According to OutletNameLA, the boat first made entry via Anaheim Bay, which is the property of the U.S. Navy.
It wasn’t immediately clear where the boat originated and it was turned over to the Naval Weapons station for further inspection, the news station reported.",0
918,"Former President George W. Bush appeared at a naturalization ceremony Monday where he praised the nation’s immigrant history and called on lawmakers to deliver comprehensive immigration reform. “America’s elected representatives have a duty to regulate who comes in and when,” Bush said at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas, where dozens took the oath of allegiance to become citizens. “In meeting this responsibility, it helps to remember that America’s immigrant history made us who we are. Amid all the complications of policy, may we never forget that immigration is a blessing and a strength.” Bush was joined by his wife, former first lady Laura Bush, who also delivered remarks before the ceremony and noted the deep immigrant community in Texas. “We’re a much richer state for all the cultures that have settled on our land,” the former first lady said. The former president echoed the sentiment, telling those at the ceremony that in addition to becoming US citizens, they would leave the room officially Texans. “If you walk out of here with a little extra attitude in your step, it shows the culture is taking hold,” Bush said. The rhetoric and policy positions from Bush came in contrast to much of the modern Republican Party and President Donald Trump, who has advocated hardline immigration policies and claimed last year he could upend the constitutional concept of birthright citizenship. Trump hosted a naturalization ceremony in the Oval Office last January where he too congratulated newly minted US citizens on their achievements. In his speech Monday, Bush predicted “just” and “fair” immigration policies would eventually take hold, but said such reform would have to start “with recognizing a plain responsibility at the border,” while contrasting himself from many prominent Democrats who have criticized the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and called for its abolition. “Borders are not arbitrary, and they need to be respected along with the fine men and women of the immigration services and the Border Patrol,” Bush said. The Bush Center said Monday’s naturalization ceremony was in line with its immigration program and used the event to highlight recently released policy recommendations that called for immigration reform that includes laws that “maintain or expand future flows of legal immigration,” establish a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and enhance “enforcement of immigration laws.”",1
957,"White House adviser Jared Kushner’s proposal to reform the US legal immigration system will be broken into two parts: one focused on border security and the other on legal immigration, according to a senior administration official. The first part of the proposal deals with border security. This would include constructing physical barriers where needed and modernizing ports of entry in the north, south and on the coasts – so that every person, vehicle and cargo container is scanned to prevent anything illegal from coming into the country, and that trade is facilitated more quickly. This proposal, the official said, would protect rights and respect due process while also preserving the right to detain, adjudicate and remove any individual if need be, especially people trying to circumvent the legal system. The second part of the proposal asks what should legal immigration look like. With 185 different kinds of visas, the system right now is easy to game, the official said. This proposal would for now keep the level of immigration at the same level it is currently, and work toward a merit-based system based on the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand systems. Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, has been a sounding board on legal immigration reforms. Over the course of two months, a number of immigration groups and business groups have gathered at the White House to discuss a range of topics related to legal immigration, including employment-based visas, temporary worker programs, the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and moving toward a merit-based immigration system, several sources familiar with the meetings told OutletName. Kushner talked up his role on immigration policy within the White House during an interview at the 2019 Time 100 Summit on Tuesday, making clear that “the President asked me to work on this topic.” Kushner insisted that he and senior adviser Stephen Miller, an influential voice on immigration in the White House, have “not had any fights” and said he is putting together “a really detailed proposal” to reform the US immigration system, but did not reveal any of the components of his proposal. “The President asked me to work on this topic,” Kushner said. “This isn’t one of the topics that I came to Washington to work on.” Kushner is reaching out to the experts within the administration to try to form a proposal, the official said. For instance, Kushner has reached out to lawyers throughout the administration and career professionals at Customs and Border Protection and said, “forget about what politicians think – what do you think? What do you need to do your job? What does a detailed proposal look like?” Kushner has also reached out to allies on Capitol Hill and, quietly, some Democrats. The goal is to produce a plan that the White House thinks is defensible, the official said, rather than have a proposal that is a mishmash of compromises. Kushner has been working with Kevin Hassett and the Council of Economic Advisers to make sure that by bringing in more high skilled workers the US would not lower wages. Kushner said Tuesday he and his team will be presenting the latest version of their proposal to Trump later this week or next week and Trump will likely offer changes.",1
39,"President Trump on Tuesday slammed Democrats who shared pictures of child migrants sleeping in cages to knock his immigration policies, only to backtrack after realizing the photos were taken during the Obama administration. “Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages,” Trump tweeted. “They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires.” One photo of children in a cell was shared numerous times over the weekend amid outrage over Trump administration policies of separating illegal immigrant parents from their children at the southern border. Trump opponents who shared the photo included activists, journalists and former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau, who said: “This is happening right now, and the only debate that matters is how we force our government to get these kids back to their families as fast as humanly possible.” However, that photo and other related images were published by The Arizona Republic in 2014, deep into Obama’s second term. Favreau later deleted the tweet, as did others who had used the pictures to blast the Trump administration. On Tuesday, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told ""OutletName & Friends"" that the backtrack suggests those critics were only interested in the photos as a partisan weapon. ""They didn't really care about the story about the migrant children,"" she said. The photos were circulated amid a debate over the Justice Department’s zero-tolerance policy when it comes to arresting illegal immigrants. That policy refers all illegal border crossings for prosecution. Since children cannot be held in adult detention centers, they are often separated. The Justice Department says the goal is to deter potential illegal immigrants from trying to cross the border, though critics say it is inhumane. “If you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said this month. “If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you, as required by law.” On Tuesday, Trump also called for a “bipartisan bill” that would include funding for the wall at the southern border and “new Border Protection for good of country.” It echoes a tweet Trump sent on Saturday where he called for Democrats to “end the horrible law that separated children from [their] parents once they cross the Border into the U.S.” and included demands for stricter immigration laws.",0
1849,"The Trump administration will tell about 200,000 Salvadorans who have been living in the U.S. for 17 years or more that they need to get out by September 2019 or face deportation.
The Department of Homeland Security’s announcement on Monday that the administration will end temporary protected status, or TPS, for natives of El Salvador, comes after it did the same for about 50,000 Haitians and 2,500 Nicaraguans, and hinted it may soon eliminate protections for about 57,000 Hondurans. It also comes after President Donald Trump rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which granted deportation relief and work permits to nearly 700,000 current recipients.
That means nearly 1 million people currently allowed to live and work in the U.S. will soon be at risk of deportation unless they can find another way to gain legal status.
The Trump administration has indicated for months that it believes the “temporary” in “temporary protected status” has been wrongly overlooked for too long.
TPS for Salvadorans was first established in 2001 after earthquakes devastated the country. Only individuals who could show they had lived in the U.S. since before February 2001 can receive TPS, which allows them to work and live without fear of removal. Congressional Research Service puts the number of Salvadoran TPS recipients at about 260,000, but other experts say it is closer to 200,000 because some have gotten other immigration relief or left the country.
Immigrant rights advocates argue that it would be wrong for the U.S. to send Salvadorans back to a country with one of the worst homicide rates in the world, particularly when many have U.S. citizen children who could be targets for gangs if they go with their parents. Experts estimate that Salvadoran TPS holders are parents to about 190,000 U.S.-born children, who are American citizens.
DHS officials, who spoke to reporters on the condition they not be identified by name, said they considered factors in El Salvador such as reconstruction after the earthquakes, but not other issues such as gang violence, because the natural disasters were the reason for the initial TPS designation.
An official said only Congress can create a permanent solution for TPS recipients and DHS looks forward to working with lawmakers.
Although administration officials have said protections for current TPS holders should be left to Congress, it’s clearly not a priority ― the White House hasn’t mentioned it in documents laying out its policy goals on immigration.
Kevin Appleby of the Center for Migration Studies called it an “incredibly short-sighted” decision by the Trump administration that could hurt the U.S., which will lose contributions of TPS holders, and set back foreign policy in the region. Many TPS holders send money back to their home countries, boosting those economies, for example.
“We’re pulling the rug out from under them,” Appleby said. “We’ve made a promise to them over a long period of time and all of a sudden they have to sell their houses, they have to take their kids out of school and they have to return to a country that they really do not know and is incredibly dangerous.”
“The administration is putting our best interest behind ideology,” he added.
Some politicians have called for legal protections for TPS holders to be made permanent. Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, who has sponsored a bill that would allow people who have held TPS since January 2011 to gain legal status, criticized the administration’s decision on Monday, and urged officials to reconsider.
“Since 2001, these people have established themselves in the United States, making countless contributions to our society and our local communities,” Diaz-Balart said in a statement. “It would be devastating to send them home after they have created a humble living for themselves and their families.”",1

Acosta traveled to McAllen, Texas to cover the presidential visit there and, as he awaited Trump, recorded a video of himself wandering along the border. “We’re not seeing any imminent danger,” Acosta says in the video as he walks the border fence. “There are no migrants trying to rush toward this fence. No sign of the national emergency the president has been talking about.”

1760,"More than 600 miles of fencing already cover about a third of the border. Trump’s wild talk of his WALL, drugs and terrorism is pure obfuscation. It ignores where a barrier might be useful, how narcotics come in, and the real sources of terrorist threats.
The United States border force has been placed in an impossible situation. It was trained to deal with single Mexican males striving to escape capture. It now faces a different phenomenon: thousands of mainly Guatemalan families a month driven northward on buses and intent on presenting themselves to border guards once in.
They do so in the social-media-transmitted knowledge that the zigzags of Trump administration policy (including the cruel separation of thousands of children from their parents during the “zero tolerance” interlude) have ended in a situation where these families know they will be released within 20 days by ICE and go to the back of an 800,000-person line awaiting their day in immigration court. That’s a virtual guarantee of two to three years in the country (though the administration is trying to make them wait in a Mexican limbo that could be nightmarish).
These immigrants are no different from those who arrived at Ellis Island: They are fleeing misery and often violence in search of a better life. Some are bona fide refugees legally entitled to protection. The United States, nation of migration and churn, must treat them with humanity. Openness, not walls, has served the country and preserves its spirit.
The United States is also a nation of laws. Trump has turned a serious dilemma into a theater of racist scapegoating and so served division, not needed immigration reform. No Democrat could vote to finance his bigotry; plenty of Democrats could vote for a secure border. Trump won 25.7 percent of the vote in El Paso. That’s because people on the border understand the benefits of binational flux. They see through Trump’s chest-beating America First to its un-American core.",1
1598,"Stephen Miller, President Trump’s hard-line immigration adviser, has long relied on data produced by the Center for Immigration Studies, a right-leaning think tank, to shape policy at the White House. Shortly after Mr. Trump was elected, Mr. Miller became well-known in the West Wing for putting printouts of studies published by the group on the president’s desk. A new set of emails first published by a civil rights advocacy group, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and shared with OutletName illustrates the degree to which Mr. Miller used the work of the think tank, which advocates restricting immigration, to shape coverage at OutletName News, a conservative news site, while he served as a communications aide to Jeff Sessions, the former Republican senator from Alabama. “He was almost a de facto assignment editor for the political writing team at OutletName,” said Kurt Bardella, the site’s former spokesman and now a frequent critic of the Trump administration. In one instance in January 2016 — around the time he joined Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign as a senior policy adviser — Mr. Miller sent OutletName employees a study from the think tank that tracked Muslim population growth in the United States: “Huge Surge in U.S. newborns named ‘Mohammed,’” Mr. Miller wrote in the subject line. A related story appeared on OutletName the next day. In another email sent in July 2015, Mr. Miller praised the work of Jason Richwine, an anti-immigration author whose work appears often on the think tank’s website. Mr. Richwine, who has drawn public furor for arguing that Hispanic immigrants are less intelligent than white Americans, said in an email on Thursday that he was a “mainstream” analyst whose work has appeared in OutletName and Politico. “Those publications are not embarrassed to promote my work,” wrote Mr. Richwine, who said that he did not personally know Mr. Miller. “So I don’t know why Stephen Miller should be either.” In several cases, the think tank has shared with readers links to websites tied to white nationalists, including the site VDARE, which regularly publishes white nationalists and traffics in anti-immigrant messages. Katie McHugh, a former OutletName editor who leaked the cache of emails, said Mr. Miller emailed her a link to an article on VDARE. Ms. McHugh has said she now denounces far-right groups. The White House defended Mr. Miller on Thursday by equating the law center’s reporting to libel. The law center “libels, slanders and defames conservatives for a living and in fact is a discredited, debunked far-left smear organization that has even recently been forced to pay someone $4 million for defamation,” Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said in an email. Mr. Gidley was apparently referring to $3.4 million the group paid to settle a lawsuit filed by Maajid Nawaz, an activist whose advocacy organization the law center initially said was an “extremist” group. Mr. Gidley also claimed that criticism of Mr. Miller was connected to his Jewish faith. “I work with Stephen,” Mr. Gidley said. “I know Stephen. He loves this country and hates bigotry in all forms — and it concerns me as to why so many on the left consistently attack Jewish members of this administration.” Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the think tank, said in an interview that he knew Mr. Miller from his time with Mr. Sessions, and that he had discussed immigration policy with him during two White House meetings. Mr. Krikorian disputed the law center’s designation of the think tank as a hate group, but said he was aware that some content on VDARE was “outrageous.” Mr. Miller, who delivered a 2015 keynote speech at one of the think tank’s events, is now one of the main speechwriters for the president, as well as Mr. Trump’s chief adviser on immigration policy. He often shares news coverage that he thinks will catch Mr. Trump’s attention, or perhaps draw his ire, according to several current and former officials. In 2017, while searching for ways to illustrate the cost of resettling refugees, Mr. Miller urged State Department officials to embrace data from the think tank that showed it was 12 times more costly to bring a refugee to the United States than to help that same person in their own region. State Department officials declined on the grounds that the think tank report, which did not take into account refugee contributions through taxes, was flawed. Mr. Miller also publicly used the think tank’s data to bolster his argument for the Trump administration’s initial travel ban that restricted travel from seven largely Muslim countries, a narrower version of which the Supreme Court upheld last year. He said he referred to the think tank’s analysis that 72 people from the those countries had been implicated in terrorist activity since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “We know there’s at least several dozen, perhaps many more than that, cases of terrorism from these countries that have happened in the United States in terms of terroristic plots, terroristic activity, material support for terrorism, supporting terrorism overseas, all different kinds of terroristic activity that’s been interdicted in the United States tracing back to these seven countries,” Mr. Miller said in an appearance on OutletName’s “This Week” in February 2017. A host of fact checks found that the think tank’s claims were overstated — most of those people were not charged with crimes related to terrorism. “The only thing I can say from the outside is that he really does seem to have mastered the art of bureaucratic infighting,” Mr. Krikorian said of Mr. Miller. “It’s clear to anyone that he’s done a good job of maintaining his position within the White House, and that’s not nothing.”",1
633,"The exodus of Venezuelans to neighboring countries could soon eclipse the number of refugees flowing from Syria at the height of the country’s civil war.
More than three million Venezuelans have fled the country and now live in countries like Argentina or even the U.S., according to a review of figures provided by the International Migration Organization and the United Nations Agency for Refugees. More than 330,000 Venezuelans have declared asylum in countries throughout the Americas.
Colombia has absorbed the largest amount of migrants, with 1,200,000 Venezuelans currently living there. 
For comparison, U.N. figures put the total number of Syrian asylum seekers during the 2015 refugee crisis in Europe at over 450,000. By December 2017, one million Syrians applied for asylum throughout the continent.
Globally, roughly five million Syrians are displaced outside of their home country. Nearly three million Syrians currently reside in Turkey.
At the beginning of January 2018, there was a 20,500 percent increase in asylum seeking applications from Venezuelans compared to one year prior. The United Nations says that from 2012 to November 2018, asylum applications from Venezuelans increased 74,191 percent.
The Caracas Chronicles, a news organizations dedicated to covering Venezuela’s economic collapse, says the “general profile” of a Venezuelan migrant is most likely a 31-year-old single male with some level of education.
Neighboring South American countries have struggled processing the surge of migrants looking for work and protection. Ecuador saw as many as 4,200 Venezuelans arriving in the country a day in August 2018.",0
1675,"This is what is happening on that front already:
A 2017 executive order barred people from seven countries, including five with Muslim majorities, from entering the country. An older rule put in place during the Obama administration compelled anyone who’d even just visited seven blacklisted nations to obtain additional clearance before traveling to the United States. Even as the Trump administration’s policy has met with legal challenges, it means that the barrier to entering the United States, for many, begins with their data and passport stamps, and is thousands of miles away from this country.
The Trump administration would also like to make it harder for immigrants who’ve received public assistance to obtain citizenship or permanent residence by redefining what it means to be a “public charge.” If the administration succeeds, it will have moved the border into immigrants’ living rooms, schools and hospital beds.
The walls of the future go beyond one administration’s policies, though. They are growing up all around us, being built by global technology companies that allow for constant surveillance, data harvesting and the alarming collection of biometric information. In 2017, the United States announced it would be storing the social media profiles of immigrants in their permanent file, ostensibly to prevent Twitter-happy terrorists from slipping in. For years, Customs and Border Protection agents have asked travelers about their social media, too.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation has said these practices can “chill and deter the free speech and association of immigrants to the United States, as well as the U.S. persons who communicate with them.” In other words, it’s no longer enough to have been born in the right place, at the right time, to the right parents. The trail of bread crumbs you leave could limit your movements.
It’s possible to get a glimpse of where a digital border might lead from China. Look at its continuing experiment with social-credit scoring, where a slip of the tongue or an unpaid debt c ould one day jeopardize someone’s ability to board a train or apply for a job. When your keystrokes and text messages become embedded in your legal identity, you create a wall around yourself without meaning to.
The Berkeley political theorist Wendy Brown diagnoses the tendency to throw up walls as a classic symptom of a nation-state’s looming impotence in the face of globalization — the flashy sports car of what she calls a “waning sovereignty.” In a recent interview for The Nation, Professor Brown told me that walls fulfill a desire for greater sovereign control in times when the concept of “bounded territory itself is in crisis.” They are signifiers of a “loss of a national ‘we’ and national control — all the things we’ve seen erupt in a huge way.”
Walls are a response to deep existential anxiety, and even if the walls come down, or fail to be built in brick and stone, the world will guarantee us little in the way of freedom, fairness or equality. It makes more sense to think of modern borders as overlapping and concentric circles that change size, shape and texture depending on who — or what — is trying to pass through.",1

“This is a president — I can’t even say he struggles with empathy; he lacks any signs of an empathic capacity to understand the suffering or plight of other people,” Mr. Connolly said, adding, “I want my guest to give witness, by virtue of being here, to the president that real human beings were negatively affected by your shutdown.”
Members of Congress each get one ticket to bring a guest to the State of the Union address; sometimes they invite family members, but more often they use their tickets to make a point. Addressing gun violence is high on the agendas of several Democrats.
Representative Lucy McBath, Democrat of Georgia, whose son Jordan Davis, 17, was shot to death in 2012 by a man upset that he was playing loud music, is bringing Jeff Binkley, the father of Maura Binkley, 21, who was killed last year in a shooting at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, Fla.
Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, is bringing Manny Oliver, whose son Joaquin Oliver was killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., during the massacre there last year.
“I hope the president will take note of how the American people voted to send a gun safety majority to Congress,” Mr. Deutch said in a statement, “and live up to his previous promises to stand up to the N.R.A. and support meaningful policies to make our communities safer.”
Mr. Trump’s immigration policy is also top of mind for Democrats this year.
Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, Democrat of New Jersey, is bringing Victorina Morales, an undocumented immigrant who spoke out about her work at Mr. Trump’s golf resort in Bedminster, N.J. Representative Adriano Espaillat, Democrat of New York, has invited Yeni González, a mother who was separated from her three children at the border, while Representative Veronica Escobar, a freshman Democrat from Texas, is bringing an immigrants’ rights advocate whose father has been deported to Mexico.",1
1970,"An earlier version of this editorial appeared in Chile’s Prensa Irreverente.
When Trump ran for the presidency in 2016, every voter knew, though some pretended not to know, what he meant by “Make America Great Again.” The message was driven home with his campaign promise of building “a great, great wall” on the U.S.-Mexico border, and vowing to make Mexico pay for it. The “again” in the now infamous slogan means pulling the United States back to the 1950s, when apartheid still reigned from North to South, de facto and de jure, respectively.
Trump’s motto may imply dragging the country even further back, to the 1880s, when the influx of Catholics, Jews and others not of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant stock began pouring onto the Yankee shore in waves; or to the 1850s, before the abolition of slavery.
Heading to the voting booths in the fall of 2016, most people understood–though, again, many played dumb–that Trump was the anti-immigrant candidate. In fact, his nativist platform was a main factor in his winning the Oval Office.
So immigrants and their allies were prepared when, in September of last year, Trump removed the protection against deportation for those who immigrated here as children illegally, which had been granted by former President Obama. (DACA recipients will “begin losing their temporary work permits in March at the rate of nearly 1,000 per day,” reports the Washington Post.) Likewise 60,000 Haitians and 2,500 Nicaraguans were ready last November when Trump stripped them of their Temporary Protected Status designation, given to those immigrant groups who cannot return to their homelands due to the chaos unleashed by a natural disaster, warfare or what have you.
Only days earlier the decision to extend Temporary Protected Status for 57,000 Honduran immigrants so angered the White House that Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly, the retired Marine four-star general and former commander of U.S. Southern Command (in charge of U.S. military operations in Central America, South America and the Caribbean), phoned the interim secretary of homeland security and pressured her to reconsider.
Since Trump took the oath of office last January, arrests made by immigrant enforcement officers have risen by 40 percent, with the number of refugees taken in sinking to its lowest level since the Carter administration. And earlier this month Trump was forced to ask Congress for $18 billion to build his “great wall,” as President Peña Nieto has repeatedly stated the Mexican government would not lend one centavo to the project.
Now Trump has taken aim at Salvadorans–at around 200,000 individuals, by far the largest group of immigrants granted Temporary Protected Status. On January 8 the Trump administration revoked the temporary residency permits of said Salvadorans, who have been living and thriving in the United States since a pair of earthquakes shook their country in 2001. The government’s announcement gives Salvadorans until September 2019 to leave or secure some other lawful way of remaining in the United States.
One can’t be sure what effects the influx of so many returning citizens will have on El Salvador, a country which, with more than 60 murders per 100,000 salvadoreños last year–and almost twice as many homicides today as in 2001, the year of the earthquakes–is arguably the deadliest in not only Central America but the entire hemisphere. (In 2015 the country recorded more than 100 murders per 100,000 citizens, making it the deadliest country outside of a war zone and the murder capital of the entire world.) There are also the around 190,000 U.S.-born children of Salvadoran TPS recipients to consider; the United States is their home, and they know nothing about living in a Latin American country, much less an extremely destabilized one.
And then there are the $4.5 billion in remittances which Salvadorans living in the United States send home every year, amounting to 17 percent of El Salvador’s GDP and its largest source of revenue. It’s hard to say how much of that money will evaporate with the return of nearly a quarter of a million Salvadoran immigrants, but to predict a decrease of at least 2 percent of GDP wouldn’t be a stretch, which would effectively erase the 2 percent growth rate that El Salvador has experienced in the last few years.
Sandra de Barraza, a columnist for El Salvador’s La Prensa Gráfica, believes the returnees will make President Sánchez Cerén and the governing Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front pay for not doing more to help their compatriots living in the United States under TPS. Moreover, a Central America specialist at the Washington Office on Latin America predicts that the influx of so many “pretty qualified, bilingual people” will displace Salvadorans already living at home, which may lead to “another surge in people leaving the country and looking for work” in the United States.
“Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” Trump asked in a meeting last Thursday with lawmakers pressuring him to reconsider his ending TPS for Haitians, Salvadorans and others. The comment immediately sparked a firestorm on social media and among the press, both for its vulgarity and the president’s perceived racist chauvinism. “Why do we need more Haitians?” the president went on to say. “Take them out.”
Clearly Trump knows something about the places from which TPS recipients have fled. He’s right, after all: they are shithole countries, or at least they could be described that way when compared to France, Germany and Norway. What Trump fails to understand, however–or, as with his voters, what he pretends not to understand–is that much of the “shit” burying Haiti, El Salvador and the other recovering countries of Latin America was dumped on them by the United States.",1
564,"Surveillance video captured the moment when more than 110 migrants exploited outdated fencing technology to cross the U.S.-Mexico Border on Monday. The end of the footage shows a human smuggler running away from the fence with a ladder on his back.
Yuma Sector Border Patrol agents responded to the area after being notified of the illegal border crossing already underway. The agents managed to apprehend all of the migrants, according to a tweet from Yuma Sector Border Patrol officials.

The video shows the group of illegal immigrants, including what appears to be minors, climbing down and dropping from the border wall after being assisted by a human smuggler on the Mexican side with a ladder. The migrants used the ladder to reach the top of the outdated fencing technology that is being replaced in many other sections of the border. They then climbed down or dropped from the top of the wall.
Yuma Sector officials told OutletName News on Thursday that 118 migrants in total crossed in this incident. Of those, the majority were Family Unit Aliens from Guatemala.
The Yuma Sector is seeing massive exploitation of the weaknesses of the existing border fencing in recent weeks as the government remains partially shut-down over funding for new border barriers. The location of this particular crossing was about 1.5 miles west of where a large group of 376 migrants recently exploited the fencing technology by digging underneath the outdated fencing.

“I have all of her letters with me,” he said in an interview. “I read them every day.”
The letter-writing project began when the Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant parents from their children at the border was roiling the country last summer. Professor Brooks gathered similarly outraged friends and colleagues at her house; together, they found the names and alien registration numbers for 30 detainees at Otay Mesa who had been part of a migrant caravan held up at the border in Tijuana. The volunteers rented a post office box for the detainees’ responses.
When the first batch of 16 handwritten letters came back July 11, Jennifer Gonzalez, a lawyer in the group, said: “We were all sharing bits and pieces and names and stories. I had this intense sense that each one of those letters didn’t just represent a real person, but they represented a family who missed this person, their community, down to their ancestors.”
Within six weeks, the group had a system in place for writing letters daily and depositing funds into detainees’ commissary accounts. The group estimates it has spent more than $10,000 since July.
“There are 140 of us who have organized to share our commissary,” wrote Ulises, who came to the United States to seek protection from the abuse he suffered as a gay man in Honduras. “We are people from different countries, India, China, Pakistan, Cuba, Jamaica, Vietnam, etc. There are many different languages and sometimes we have to communicate by signals because we don’t speak the same language, but that does not prevent us from providing moral support to each other.”
Terrie Vorono, a volunteer in the group, thanked him for his letter and offered a connection: As the mother of a gay son, she is an advocate for gay rights. “We know that our children are never 100 percent safe even in the United States,” she wrote to him.
The letter writers have not found universal support. Rosanna Benink, who has hosted volunteers at her house every Monday, said one of her friends wondered why she bothered.",1

228,"Because of multiple lawsuits challenging his declaration of a national emergency, we don’t know if President Trump will be able to carry out his plans to use $8 billion in federal funds to build a barrier along parts of the U.S.-Mexico border to reduce illegal immigration.
But even if the courts side with the president – and even if he then uses billions of dollars more to build additional sections of a border barrier – no wall or fence alone will stop immigrants from crossing our southern border in large numbers.
That’s because in recent years illegal immigrants have learned to exploit loopholes in our asylum laws. Many voluntarily turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents as soon as they cross into the U.S. and fraudulently claim asylum.
Illegal immigrants have been told back in their home countries that requesting asylum unlocks the door to America. Simply making a request will ent the U.S. government from immediately deporting the person seeking asylum.
SUPREME COURT REJECTS TRUMP BID TO ENFORCE ASYLUM CRACKDOWN
Instead, each asylum claim is referred to federal immigration court, where it takes an average of 578 days for a decision to be reached on a request.
Because of this huge court backlog, more than 809,000 immigrants are waiting for their asylum claims to be heard in immigration court. That’s enough people to create the 18th largest city in the U.S.
A wall wouldn't keep out these asylum seekers, who could simply turn themselves in at legal points of entry. To reduce this flow of illegal immigrants, the White House and Congress must close asylum loopholes.
While waiting for a decision on their asylum claims, illegal immigrants get to stay in the U.S. Many don’t show up when their immigration court hearings are finally scheduled and simply continue staying in America illegally. Approximately 600,000 people disappeared before their asylum hearings between 2003 and 2015.
A wall wouldn't keep out these asylum seekers, who could simply turn themselves in at legal points of entry. To reduce this flow of illegal immigrants, the White House and Congress must close asylum loopholes.
Our asylum system wasn't always so prone to abuse. Before 2009, courts only offered asylum to individuals who feared – or had already suffered – persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or membership in a particular social group.
For instance, Chinese Christians fleeing from threats of imprisonment had a strong chance to obtain asylum.
But in 2009, the Obama administration determined that domestic and gang violence should also be grounds for asylum. Foreigners quickly learned that claiming a ""credible fear"" of such violence – regardless of the truth of those claims – would gain them entry into the United States.
The number of asylum seekers predictably ballooned. In 2008, immigration courts received approximately 42,000 asylum requests. The figure of new requests made in 2018 rose to 160,000.
Central Americans file a majority of the asylum requests. The number of Hondurans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans seeking asylum has jumped almost 900 percent since 2012.
This surge wasn't driven by gang or domestic violence. The homicide rate in Honduras has actually fallen by more than 50 percent since 2012. The murder rate in El Salvador has similarly plummeted by more than half. The tiny nation's per capita homicide rate is now lower than Baltimore's. Guatemala has become much safer in recent years as well.
Nearly 80 percent of asylum requests from Hondurans, Guatemalans, and Salvadorans are ultimately denied by U.S. courts – a sure sign that most of these immigrants aren't at unique risk of gang or domestic violence.
Illegal immigrants typically flock to low-skilled jobs, where they compete against less-educated Americans. An excess of low-skilled workers gives employers more leverage to hold down wages for U.S. citizens and legal residents.
According to Harvard economist George Borjas, Americans without high school diplomas earn $800 to $1,500 less each year due to illegal immigration.
Asylum abuse also hurts taxpayers, who foot the bill for the schools, health care programs and social services that illegal immigrants use.
In fact, illegal immigration costs Americans up to an estimated to $116 billion per year.
President Trump’s planned border barrier wouldn't stop this abuse, even if it were built from sea to shining sea, since it doesn't address two major asylum-law loopholes.
Consider the ""Flores settlement,"" a 1997 court ruling that prohibits the U.S. government from detaining migrant children for more than 20 days.
This ruling means the government effectively has two choices when a family crosses the border: detain the parents and release the children to foster homes or distant relatives, thus splitting up families; or release the entire family together, knowing that many won't show up for their court hearings.
Neither option is desirable. Instead, the White House should ask Congress to override the Flores settlement and allow families to be kept together in federal custody until their cases are settled.
The Trump administration should also continue to urge Congress to tweak the Wilberforce Act, which ents immigration authorities from treating all unaccompanied foreign minors equally.
Currently, all minors from countries other than Mexico or Canada are allowed to remain in the United States for a substantial period of time until a full asylum hearing. This gives many minors the hope they can remain long-term.
The law generated a surge of underage migrants from Central America. If Congress amended the law to stop offering guaranteed hearings, it would deter many children from attempting the dangerous journey to the United States.
President Trump was elected to end illegal immigration. He should reverse the actions of President Obama that made getting asylum easier and close other asylum loopholes to end the chaos at the border.

123,"Days after Donald Trump won the White House vowing to deport millions of people in the country illegally and fortify the Mexican border, California farmer Kevin Herman ordered nearly $600,000 in new equipment, cutting the number of workers he'll need starting with the next harvest.
Herman, who grows figs, persimmons and almonds in the nation's most productive farming state, said Trump's comments pushed him to make the purchase, larger than he would have otherwise.
""No doubt about it,"" Herman said. ""I probably wouldn't have spent as much or bought as much machinery as I did.""
Others in California's farming industry say Trump's tough campaign talk targeting immigrants in the country illegally — including a vast number of farmworkers — spurred them into action, too.
EX-AG HOLDER HIRED TO HELP CALIFORNIA FIGHT TRUMP
They're calling on congressional representatives to educate the incoming president on the workforce it takes to feed the country, and they're assuring workers they'll protect them.
San Joaquin Valley farmer Joe Del Bosque recently gathered about 20 year-round employees at a Los Banos steakhouse for their annual holiday lunch.
The festivities began in a serious tone. The topic of immigration took a bigger part of the conversation this year because of Trump, he said.
Del Bosque told his crew he'll make sure the new administration knows their vital role in the farming industry. It's a message Del Bosque wants his managers to spread to another 300 seasonal workers needed at the harvest's peak.
Leticia Alfaro, a food-safety supervisor at the farm, said in an interview that many of her friends who work in the fields don't have proper documentation like her, and they take Trump's threats seriously.
""They're terrified by his comments,"" Alfaro, 53, said in Spanish.
They fear being deported and torn from their children who were born here, she said. After Trump takes office, they wonder if it will be safe to make a simple trip to the grocery store, fearing checkpoints where they'll be pulled over and have to show their documentation.
Trump's remarks were felt sharply in California, which produces nearly half the country's fruits, vegetables and nuts valued at $47 billion annually. Experts say his words resonate nationwide.
Texas, Florida and Georgia are examples of states with large migrant communities dominating home construction, health care, food service industries, said David Zonderman, a labor historian at North Carolina State University.
CALIFORNIA SNOWPACK MEASURES LOW, BUT BIG STORMS COMING
""California might be ground zero,"" he said of immigrant families living in the shadows. ""But it's not a unique California issue.""
The fear stems from Trump's campaign rallies, where he received a rousing response each time he vowed to deport people who are in the country illegally — up to 11 million. That position softened after Trump won the election, when he said he'd start with 3 million with criminal records.
Some farmers point to Trump's postelection shift as a sign his campaign bluster won't become reality. He is, after all, a businessman like them, they say. But others believe this shift underscores the president-elect's unpredictable nature.
""Our workers are scared,"" said Joe Garcia, a farm labor contractor who hires up to 4,000 people each year to pick grapes from Napa to Bakersfield and along the Central Coast. ""If they're concerned, we're concerned.""
Since Election Day, Garcia's crews throughout the state have been asking what will happen to them when Trump takes office. Farmers also are calling to see if they'll need to pay more to attract people to prune the vines, he said.
Garcia tells farmers not to panic. They'll learn how many return from Mexico after the holidays. ""We'll plan around what we have,"" he tells them. ""That's all we can do.""
Roughly 325,000 workers in California do the back-breaking jobs that farmers say nobody else will do, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Manuel Cunha Jr., president of the Nisei Farmers League farming association, estimates 85 percent of California farmworkers live in the United States illegally.
BIG BUSINESS PRESSURING TRUMP TO ABANDON PLEDGES OF MASS DEPORTATION
Farmers for years have scrambled under a shrinking labor pool.
Mexico's improving economy has slowed the flow of migrant workers. The dangerous border, controlled by drug cartels and human traffickers, keeps away others.
Herman, the farmer who bought three new almond sweepers, said Trump influenced him on top of California's rising minimum wage and a new law giving farm laborers overtime rights that are equal to workers in other industries.
Plus, Herman said, he's heard too many workers question whether they'll return from their holiday trips to Mexico. ""It's stories like that that have motivated me to become efficient and upgrade my equipment,"" Herman said.
Tom Nassif, a Trump adviser and president of the powerful trade association Western Growers, said farmers shouldn't fear the president-elect. Trump isn't interested in deporting their workers, he said.
Nassif said he isn't privy to the details of Trump's immigration policy. He's recommended that Trump allow farmworkers to stay by putting immigrants in the country illegally who are otherwise law-abiding residents on a period of probation under conditions that they pay taxes, learn English and obey all laws.
""I think he's looking at people who have committed more serious crimes and start with them first — and rightly so,"" said Nassif, picked by Trump's campaign team to serve on an agriculture advisory committee. ""I think there's less reason to worry than most people believe there is.""",0

Likewise, now 67 to 87 percent of Republican voters and conservatives support building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Democrat voters have not increased their opposition to the wall over the last year by even one percent.
Among midwest voters, college educated voters, men, and white Americans, the border wall has jumped in popularity since last year. For midwest voters, the poll claimed only 35 percent supported the wall last year. Today, midwest support for the wall is up to nearly 50 percent, a 14 percent increase.
Only 30 percent of college educated voters supported the wall last year, the poll stated. This year, 43 percent support the wall, a jump of 13 percent. Similarly, a majority of 54 percent of white Americans now support the wall, up ten percent from last year, and nearly 50 percent of American men support the wall, an increase of nine percentage points.
Exclusive–Kris Kobach: A Wall Stops Illegal Immigration, ‘Drones and Sensors’ Don’t://t.co/3kGg2CsPDu — John Binder 👽 () January 8, 2019
Currently, the federal government has remained partially shut down as House Democrats block any funding for physical barriers at the U.S.-Mexico border. A handful of Senate Republicans, meanwhile, crafted a plan to give amnesty to illegal aliens that ultimately failed to gain traction.
President Donald Trump has said he is reviewing a plan to deem the border and illegal immigration a national emergency in order to fund a wall along the southern border.
Border crossings in November 2018 — the last month from which data is available — hit close to 52,000, marking the highest level of illegal immigration in the month of November since 2006. Projections indicate that illegal immigration for next year will reach 600,000 border crossings, the highest level of illegal immigration in more than a decade. Meanwhile, drug overdoses in 2017 killed an unprecedented 72,287 U.S. residents, nearly three times the number of individuals killed by global terrorism. Nearly 50,000 of those deadly overdoses were caused by either heroin or fentanyl.",0
625,"Some federal judges handling immigration-related cases are balking at delaying court proceedings during the government shutdown. Such judges are acting differently than courts did during 2013’s shutdown under President Obama.
In 2013, federal courts postponed cases involving Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys. During this shutdown, most federal courts are apparently doing likewise. Other judges with immigration-related or Trump-centered cases, however, are requiring DOJ attorneys to work pending litigation.
Such judges ignore the Constitution’s limits on their authority. Federal courts, as classically explained in Federalist #78, “have neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment.”
As devotees of the progressive movement, however, many judges reject the Constitution’s structure of separation of powers. Some really believe federal courts should be the most powerful branch of government. They are rightly called “judicial supremacists.”
Supremacist judges have been over-reaching their authority with impunity for many years. They push the limits like speculators who believe stock or real-estate markets will never crash. As Federalist #78 cautions, federal courts must “ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.”
Americans’ respect for courts and the rule of law results in court judgments being routinely implemented. But when a party refuses to comply with a judgment, who enforces it? Judges are powerless on their own. They must rely on U.S. Marshals.
Some federal judges consider U.S. Marshals to be court employees, but they’re not. Marshals are DOJ employees, with some assigned to federal courts. Thus, U.S. Marshals ultimately work for the president.
The Antideficiency Act (ADA), triggered in government shutdowns, illustrates separation-of-powers interplay among the branches. The ADA, Congress’s attempt to restrain executive spending, also applies to the courts. It bars officers and employees from obligating funds Congress has not appropriated. Thus, shutdowns force furloughing of non-essential employees.
In this shutdown, some judges are presuming to have power over executive branch decisions about who is and is not essential. Like the executive, courts decide who of their own employees are essential. Interfering in DOJ’s decisions about essential employees is political, not judicial, action.
To comply with these illegitimate orders, DOJ must either change or ignore its own shutdown plan. If DOJ’s “non-essential” lawyers appear in court, they would be acting as “volunteers.”
The ADA bars volunteering “except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property.” The ADA provides that “the term ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property’ does not include ongoing, regular functions of government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the safety of human life or the protection of property.”
“Knowing and willful” ADA violations constitute crimes.
Nevertheless, a judge hearing challenges to restrictions on asylum-seekers is insisting DOJ lawyers continue working. He claims his case involves” the safety of human life or the protection of property.” But his case doesn’t necessarily meet the ADA’s definition of “emergency.” The judge’s comments reflect his annoyance that 91 percent of Customs and Border Protection workers continue working.
This judge doesn’t disguise disagreement with President Trump’s judgments about safety. He sees asylum seekers; Trump sees invading aliens. The judge likely believes himself duty-bound to block Trump’s border policies. The Constitution, however, makes presidents primarily responsible for defending the country’s safety. Unlike initiating war, which requires a declaration by Congress, the president is obligated to defend the country against attacks and invasions — including by organized caravans.
Judicial Supremacists should reread Marbury v. Madison. Like Federalist 78, Marbury couples the independence of the federal judiciary with the separation-of-powers limits to its authority.
In Marbury, Chief Justice Marshall ruled the Court lacked jurisdiction to order a particular action against Jefferson’s Secretary of State. Marshall also realized that President Jefferson would never enforce any such order. Both sides understood that federal courts lack power and depend ultimately on the president enforcing court orders.
Like Presidents Jefferson, Jackson, and FDR, President Trump does not hesitate to criticize federal judges. Consider what President Trump could — but hopefully will not — do. U.S. Marshals are classified as essential. Some marshals have already been dispatched to the border. What would happen if the president directed more marshals to the border, including those assigned to federal courts? Unavoidably, without marshals for safety protection, courts would close. And federal judges could do nothing but complain.
The Constitution’s Separation of Powers ensures each branch has the ability to defend itself against the other two, ideally producing a peaceful equilibrium. Judicial supremacists distort that structure to favor the judiciary.
Every judge addicted to power should consider the hypothetical of an unpredictable president doing the unthinkable. Re-deploying court-assigned marshals during a shutdown would reveal the powerlessness of judges. It would also provide political leverage, otherwise lacking, against congressional Democrats. Such a hypothetical should remind everyone that the federal judiciary remains “the weakest branch.”",0
705,"Donald Trump renewed his calls for tougher immigration restrictions and extreme vetting after a terror attack on the London Bridge left several people dead and dozens more injured.
Though the White House has repeatedly denied that the executive orders he signed that restricted immigration from certain counties were “travel bans,” the president himself called it one in a series of tweets Monday morning.
Trump said: “People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!”
People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN! — Donald J. Trump () June 5, 2017
Then he criticized the Justice Department, which is run by his pick, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. “The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.” he tweeted. “The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court – & seek much tougher version!”

1544,"“Mami!” the children’s voices cry out, between sobs. “Papá!” A recording of immigrant children calling out desperately for their parents after being separated from them by United States immigration authorities was released on Monday by the investigative news site ProPublica. The recording, nearly eight minutes in length, added disturbing and intimate notes to the debate over the Trump administration’s practice of separating children from their parents when families are detained at the border. ProPublica said in an article accompanying the audio clip that it was recorded last week inside a U.S. Customs and Border Protection detention center. Ten Central American children who were separated from their parents by immigration authorities are heard in the clip, along with some adults. The recording is one of a number of documents and accounts that have emerged in recent days showing the toll the practice is taking on children, even though government officials have forbidden journalists who tour the detention centers for migrant children from using cameras or conducting interviews with the children. A photo of a 2-year-old girl crying as a border agent pats down her mother, taken near the Rio Grande by John Moore of Getty Images, has become a widely shared image emblematic of the children’s plight. On Sunday, OutletName published an article about Elsa Johana Ortiz Enriquez and her 8-year-old son Anthony, who were separated by American officials when they were detained after crossing the border together in May. Ms. Ortiz was deported to her home country, Guatemala, without her son, who was sent to a shelter for migrant children. Also on Monday photos emerged from inside a shelter in Brownsville, Tex., with a toddler crawling across a multi-color mat on the floor. She had been separated from her relatives and at the facility about a month, said the person who took the photo who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to release an image. According to ProPublica, the audio recording was provided to Jennifer Harbury, a civil rights lawyer, by a client who wished to remain anonymous. Ms. Harbury then provided the recording to ProPublica. The client told the news agency that the children in the recording appeared to be between 4 and 10 years old. ProPublica reported that the children appeared to have been at the detention center for less than 24 hours at the time the recording was made, and that consular officials “tried to comfort them with snacks and toys,” but added, “the children were inconsolable.” At one point, a child identified in the article as a 6-year-old Salvadoran girl is heard asking an adult identified as a consular worker if she can call her aunt. “My mommy says that I’ll go with my aunt,” the girl says in Spanish. “And that she’ll come to pick me up there as quickly as possible.” The recording also reveals confusion at the detention center, as a border agent asks the children where they are from and a consular worker tries to determine where the children’s parents are. What is unmistakable are the sounds of frightened children. At one point, a voice belonging to a man identified by ProPublica as a Border Patrol agent speaks over their cries. “Well, we have an orchestra here,” the man says. “What’s missing is a conductor.”",1
2070,"A bipartisan group of centrist senators met Sunday to work out a potential compromise that would fund the government until Feb. 8, contingent on a promise to hold a vote on an immigration bill before then.
In exchange for more Democratic votes to reopen the government, GOP leadership would need to offer some sort of commitment to help the so-called “Dreamers” in coming weeks, according to several senators who attended the meeting in the office of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) on Capitol Hill.
It’s not clear, however, whether Democrats would accept a simply verbal commitment from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that the Senate would consider an immigration bill at some point in the future. He already pledged to do so last month, for example.
“I think he’d be more than happy to publicly state he’ll be willing to move to immigration at a very near time,” Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said.
President Donald Trump necessitated a legislative fix for Dreamers ― undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children ― when he ended former President Barack Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, putting them at risk of losing work permits and deportation relief. The program expires in early March, putting pressure on Congress to reach a solution to protect 700,000 young people from deportation.
The bipartisan group of roughly 20 senators presented the terms of the potential deal to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), who spoke about it privately later. The group included Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.).
There’s no deal at this time, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. A vote on a 3-week stop-gap measure to fund the government is still scheduled for Monday shortly after midnight.
Murkowski said McConnell was “receptive” to the deal worked out by the moderate senators, but that it was ultimately up to him and Schumer to come to an agreement on funding the government.
“I think it was important for him to hear the direction that we had gained from these broader groups,” Murkowski said.
The White House has said that the issue of immigration should not be considered until government funding is approved. House Republican leaders also rejected the idea of committing to holding an immigration vote until Democrats vote to reopen the government.
During a Sunday interview on OutletName’s “Face the Nation,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) dismissed a bipartisan immigration framework brokered by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) as an “end run” around existing negotiations.
In a sign the two sides were no closer to reaching an agreement, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) also poured cold water over the prospect of committing to a vote on an immigration bill before Feb. 8.
“We’re more than happy to have a vote on it well before the deadline,” Cornyn said of a legislative fix on DACA. “Turning the agenda over to Democrats who just shut down the government makes no sense to me. It just seems like it encourages bad behavior.”",1
1998,"Thousands of accusations of sexual abuse and harassment of migrant children in government-funded shelters were made over the past four years, including scores directed against adult staff members, according to federal data released Tuesday.
The cases include allegations of inappropriate touching to staff members allegedly watching minors while they bathed and showing pornographic videos to minors. Some of the allegations included inappropriate conduct by minors in shelters against other minors, as well as by staff members.
Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., released the Health and Human Services Department data amid a hearing on the Trump administration’s policy of family separations at the border. The data span both the Obama and Trump administrations, and were first reported by Axios.
From October 2014 to July 2018, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a part of Health and Human Services, received 4,556 complaints, including allegations of sexual abuse, harassment and inappropriate behavior. Of those, the Justice Department received 1,303 more serious sex abuse complaints, including 178 allegations of sexual abuse by adult staff, officials said.
The number of complaints decreased during budget year 2017, but otherwise has hovered at about 1,200 per year. Refugee Resettlement officials said the majority of the allegations were “inappropriate sexual behaviors” between minors at the facilities, and shelters can often resolve these allegations through counseling and other non-criminal avenues.
Department officials said the majority of allegations weren’t substantiated, and they defended their care of children. They also noted the accused staff members were not employees of the department.
“We share the concern,” said Jonathan White, a Health and Human Services official who was in charge of the effort to reunify children with their parents, testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. “Any time a child is abused ... is one time too many. We abide fully with the laws this Congress has passed, and we are very proud of our outstanding track record of full compliance including referring every allegation for investigation.”
The Office of Refugee Resettlement manages the care of tens of thousands of migrant children who cycle through the system each year. More than 2,700 children were separated from their parents over the summer at the border, and were placed in shelters. But most of the children in government custody crossed the border alone.
Children are placed in custody until they can be released to sponsors, usually a parent or close relative, while awaiting immigration proceedings. The shelters are privately run under contracts with the government.
Youth are held for increasingly longer periods of time, currently about two months. As of the first week of February, more than 11,000 migrant toddlers, children and teens were in federal custody as unaccompanied minors, up from about 2,500 detained children three months after Trump took office.
Sexual abuse allegations are reported to federal law enforcement, though it’s not clear whether anyone was charged criminally. In many cases, staff members were suspended and eventually fired.
Deutch said the data were clearly alarming.
“Together, these documents detail an unsafe environment of sexual assaults by staff on unaccompanied minors,” he said.
Health and Human Services officials say all allegations are taken very seriously, and the department cooperates with all investigations.
Facilities under government contract must provide training to all staff, contractors and volunteers. Background checks are completed on potential employees, and facilities are prohibited from hiring anyone who has engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior.
But Arizona officials moved last fall to revoke licenses for one of the major nonprofits that operates migrant children shelters after it missed a deadline to show that all its employees passed background checks.
A state investigation of Texas-based Southwest Key last summer, prompted by several reports of sexual abuse of immigrant children in Arizona, found that some shelters had not conducted fingerprint checks for all employees.",1
599,"Democrats immediately rejected President Donald Trump’s offer of a work-permit amnesty for one million registered migrants in exchange for 230 miles of new border wall.
The rejection came even though Trump’s offer angered his base by trading a DACA temporary amnesty for a wall.
Also, Trump did not ask for the reform of the many catch-and-release rules which allow the cartels to profitably smuggle hundreds of thousands of poor migrants into the U.S. labor market, welfare rolls, and U.S. K-12 schools.
The speech came after Trump had offered a series of smaller concessions in closed-door negotiations since Christmas.
Democrats quickly dismissed the amnesty offer.
Sen. Chuck Schumer also rejected the compromise, saying, “offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking.”

My response to reported White House offer to end President Trump's government shutdown in exchange for the border wall and DACA: pic.twitter.com/WhsJgRNW56 — Senator Dick Durbin () January 19, 2019
Before the speech began, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement rejecting the deal:
Unfortunately, initial reports make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people’s lives. It is unlikely that any one of these provisions alone would pass the House, and taken together, they are a non-starter. For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports.
In general, Democrats want to win permanent amnesty for at least 11 million illegals, block Trump’s border reforms, including his border wall, and ensure a steady inflow of migrants.
Trump coupled his offer with requests for popular improvements along the border, including extra money for surveillance and immigration judges. But he did not call for reforms of the current catch-and-release rules and instead suggested those vital reforms be postponed to another series of negotiations.
The Democrats rejected the deal even though pro-American reform groups slammed the work-permit-amnesty-for-wall offer as bad politics and bad policy
“A wall for amnesty is terrible idea,” said one immigration reformer.
The proposed swap is bad politics, he said. “A quarter of wall funding — only $5.7 billion — is an even worse deal. This would be an absolute betrayal of the GOP base who voted Trump into office. Trump needs to listen to the base, not [White House aides] on this issue.”
The proposed deal would allow Washington to pocket the amnesty while denying Trump his wall, he added. “You must swap statutory changes for statutory changes. There is a chance that the wall will never be built but the amnesty happens immediately and is irreversible. It is 1986 all over again – when the amnesty happened immediately and the reforms never happened.”
Trump has made 3-5 concessions in the border wall fight. But estb. media hides Democrats' refusal to offer anything in exchange. So Trump sees an incentive to escalate via a national emergency to get a wall. IOW, media's tilt skews DC political incentives ://t.co/cf9Qnr0tzf — Neil Munro () January 10, 2019
Overall, the proposed deal would create new political problems for Trump before 2020, he said. “There’s one thing that will cause another crisis — another amnesty. This whole thing started with the DACA magnet. The notion that we’re about to solve the problem with more of what caused the problems in the first place is ridiculous.”
“The offer the President announced today is a loser for the forgotten American workers who were central to his campaign promises,” said NumbersUSA.
Establishment reporters covering the dispute sympathetically portrayed the Democrats’ rejection:

688,"A federal judge in Hawaii on Monday narrowed the scope of an injunction he issued in March, after an appeals court concluded his initial order was too broad.
U.S. District Court Judge Derrick Watson’s March order prohibited the Departments of State and Homeland Security from reviewing federal vetting procedures and preparing reports recommending additional security measures for migrant and refugee entry. Per his new order, State and DHS may begin those reviews, provided they “do not burden individuals outside of the executive branch of the federal government.”
Watson’s order put the administration in something of a bind — the government’s stated rationale for interrupting migrant entry for 90 days was to assess the strength of its vetting processes. The administration claims this assessment is essential for the nation’s continued security. Critics charged that the government was not being forthright about the order’s true objectives, as it had not yet conducted these “vital” policy reviews — but it was Watson’s order that prohibited them from doing so in the first place.
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the injunction was overly-broad last week.
The revised injunction makes it slightly less likely the Supreme Court will intervene to amend the injunction, as this dimension of Watson’s ruling was the most obvious error of law. The justices could announce as soon as Thursday whether they will review lower court rulings barring the order’s enforcement.
Should the high court agree to review the case, the government may now be asked about its progress on the vetting assessment in judicial proceedings, creating an additional complication for their defense of the order.",0
1643,"A culture war over immigration replays the racialized debate that dominated the 2016 presidential campaign. As much as it saddens me to say it, the evidence is pretty clear that a racialized debate helps Trump. It’s the kind of debate that will make it harder for Democrats to retake the Senate and House this year.
Multiple studies have found that the political views of white Americans drift to the right when they are reminded that the country’s population is slowly becoming less white. And many of these voters are winnable for Democrats. A good number, remember, voted for Barack Obama. They may have some racist views — many people do — but they’re neither deplorable nor irredeemable human beings. Steve Bannon, the guru of white nationalism, understood this dynamic, once saying, “The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got ’em.”
Similarly, some innovative polling by YouGov has found that a large portion of white Americans see “prohibiting discrimination against women and minorities” as one of the Democratic Party’s top priorities. Unfortunately, few white Americans who aren’t already loyal Democrats say the same issue is one of their own priorities. They’re more worried about their own struggles, many of which are economic. “It’s a political liability for Democrats,” Doug Rivers, YouGov’s chief scientist told me, “in the same way being the party of the rich is a problem for Republicans.”
I know that many progressives are sick of hearing about white voters, but it’s extremely hard to succeed in American politics without winning a good portion of them. About 69 percent of eligible voters are non-Hispanic whites. They have outsize power too, thanks to a combination of their turnout rates, their geographic dispersion, gerrymandering and the Senate’s small-state bonus.
Briahna Joy Gray wrote a must-read essay on this topic for New York magazine, titled, “Racism May Have Gotten Us Into This Mess, but Identity Politics Can’t Get Us Out.” Or as Matthew Yglesias wrote in Vox last week, “If you want to help the people most severely victimized by Trumpism, you need to beat Trumpism at the polls.”
The best debate for Democrats is one that keeps reminding white working-class voters that they’re working class. It’s a debate about Medicare, Medicaid, taxes or Wall Street. The worst debate is one that keeps reminding those voters that they’re white.
To put it another way, if you’re a Democrat who’s frustrated that Republicans have managed to turn the shutdown into a fight over immigration, ask yourself: Why would they do that?
Democratic leaders are certainly right to insist on protection for the Dreamers. The question is whether the best way to protect them, and the best way to elect politicians who will help them in the long term involves keeping immigration policy in the political spotlight for weeks on end.
The smart move now for Democrats is to accept a short-term funding bill that ends the shutdown and diffuses the tension. Republican leaders are open to that solution, because they have their own vulnerabilities. Their party is the majority party, which is often blamed for dysfunction.
That solution feels a bit unsatisfying, I know. But tactical retreats can lead to big victories in the future.",1
1574,"President Trump declared a national emergency on the border with Mexico on Friday in order to access billions of dollars that Congress refused to give him to build a wall there, transforming a highly charged policy dispute into a confrontation over the separation of powers outlined in the Constitution. Trying to regain momentum after losing a grinding two-month battle with lawmakers over funding the wall, Mr. Trump asserted that the flow of drugs, criminals and illegal immigrants from Mexico constituted a profound threat to national security that justified unilateral action. “We’re going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border, and we’re going to do it one way or the other,” he said in a televised statement in the Rose Garden barely 13 hours after Congress passed a spending measure without the money he had sought. “It’s an invasion,” he added. “We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country.” But with illegal border crossings already down and critics accusing him of manufacturing a crisis, he may have undercut his own argument that the border situation was so urgent that it required emergency action. “I didn’t need to do this, but I’d rather do it much faster,” he said. “I just want to get it done faster, that’s all.” The president’s decision incited instant condemnation from Democrats, who called it an unconstitutional abuse of his authority and vowed to try to overturn it with the support of Republicans who also objected to the move. “This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed president, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a joint statement. Mr. Trump’s announcement came during a freewheeling, 50-minute appearance in which he ping-ponged from topic to topic, touching on the economy, China trade talks and his coming summit meeting with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. The president again suggested that he should win the Nobel Peace Prize, and he reviewed which conservative commentators had been supportive of him, while dismissing Ann Coulter, who has not. Sounding alternately defensive and aggrieved, Mr. Trump explained his failure to secure wall funding during his first two years in office when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress by saying, “I was a little new to the job.” He blamed “certain people, a particular one, for not having pushed this faster,” a clear reference to former Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, a Republican. Mr. Trump’s assertions were replete with misinformation and, when challenged by reporters, he refused to accept statistics produced by his own government that conflicted with his narrative. “The numbers that you gave are wrong,” he told one reporter. “It’s a fake question.” On point after point, the president insisted that he would be proved correct. “People said, ‘Trump is crazy,’” he said at one point, discussing his outreach to Mr. Kim. “And you know what it ended up being? A very good relationship.” Mr. Trump acknowledged that his declaration of a national emergency would be litigated in the courts and even predicted a rough road for his side. “Look, I expect to be sued,” he said, launching into a mocking riff about how he anticipated lower court rulings against him. “And we’ll win in the Supreme Court,” he predicted. Indeed, Public Citizen, an advocacy group, filed suit by the end of the day on behalf of three Texas landowners whose property might be taken for a barrier. California and New York likewise announced that they will sue over what Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called the president’s “vanity project,” and a roster of other groups lined up to do the same. “Fortunately, Donald Trump is not the last word,” said Mr. Newsom, a Democrat. “The courts will be the last word.” Among those predicting a flurry of judicial decisions against Mr. Trump was George T. Conway III, a conservative lawyer and the husband of Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor. “If he knows he is going to lose,” Mr. Conway, a vocal critic of Mr. Trump, wrote on Twitter, “then he knows he is violating the Constitution and laws he has sworn to uphold.” The House Judiciary Committee announced Friday that it would investigate the president’s emergency claim, while House Democrats plan to introduce legislation to block it. That measure could pass both houses of Congress if it wins the votes of the half-dozen Republican senators who have criticized the declaration, forcing Mr. Trump to issue the first veto of his presidency. The emergency declaration, according to White House officials, enables the president to divert $3.6 billion from military construction projects to the wall. Mr. Trump will also use more traditional presidential discretion to tap $2.5 billion from counternarcotics programs and $600 million from a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund. Combined with $1.375 billion authorized for fencing in the spending package passed on Thursday night, Mr. Trump would have about $8 billion in all for barriers, significantly more than the $5.7 billion he unsuccessfully demanded from Congress. The president opted not to tap hurricane relief money from Texas or Puerto Rico, an idea that had generated angry complaints from Republicans. But he expressed no concern that diverting military construction money would delay projects benefiting the troops like base housing, schools and gyms. “It didn’t sound too important to me,” he said. Trump’s Emergency Declaration Is the First Since 9/11 to Authorize Military Action
Here’s how President Trump’s border wall fits on the list of emergency declarations. Neither the White House nor the Pentagon had yet identified which projects may be shelved as a result, but Pentagon lawyers and other officials planned to work over the weekend to identify which construction funds would be diverted. The declaration also provided that land may be transferred to the Defense Department from other federal agencies or from privately purchased or condemned land. The next step would be to secure those lands, where the Pentagon would erect barriers. The declaration gives Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, broad latitude to carry out this process. Most Americans oppose Mr. Trump’s emergency declaration, according to polls. One released this week by OutletName found 56 percent against it, including 20 percent of Republicans. Mr. Trump’s desire for approval by OutletName and other conservative news outlets was on display when he identified various pundits as supporters, naming Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson and Rush Limbaugh, although he insisted that “they don’t decide policy.” But Ms. Coulter, who has viscerally attacked Mr. Trump for caving on the wall, has clearly gotten under his skin. “I don’t know her,” he said before quickly correcting himself. “I hardly know her. I haven’t spoken to her in way over a year.” He noted, though, that she was an early predictor of his election victory. “So I like her, but she’s off the reservation,” he said. “But anybody that knows her understands that.” Ms. Coulter fired back shortly afterward. “The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot,” she said on KOutletName radio in Los Angeles. White House officials rejected criticism from across the ideological spectrum that Mr. Trump was creating a precedent that future presidents could use to ignore the will of Congress. Republicans have expressed concern that a Democratic commander in chief could cite Mr. Trump’s move to declare a national emergency over gun violence or climate change without legislation from Congress. “It actually creates zero precedent,” Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told reporters. “This is authority given to the president in law already. It’s not as if he just didn’t get what he wanted so he’s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money.” Presidents have declared national emergencies under a 1970s-era law about five dozen times, and 31 of those prior emergencies remain active. But most of them dealt with foreign crises and involved freezing property, blocking trade or exports or taking other actions against national adversaries, not redirecting money without explicit congressional authorization. White House officials cited only two times that such emergency declarations were used by presidents to spend money without legislative approval — once by President George Bush in 1990 during the run-up to the Persian Gulf war, and again by his son, President George W. Bush, in 2001 after the terrorist attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. In both of those cases, the presidents were responding to new events — the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Al Qaeda’s assault on the United States — and were moving military funds around for a military purposes. Neither was taking action specifically rejected by Congress. In Mr. Trump’s case, he is defining a longstanding problem at the border as an emergency even though border apprehensions have actually fallen in recent years, to 400,000 in the last fiscal year from a peak of 1.6 million in the 2000 fiscal year. And unlike either of the Bushes, he is taking action after failing to persuade lawmakers to go along with his plans through the regular appropriations process. The spending package passed Thursday by Congress included none of the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump demanded for 234 miles of steel wall. Instead, it provided $1.375 billion for about 55 miles of fencing. Mr. Trump signed the package into law on Friday anyway to avoid a second government shutdown after the impasse over border wall funding closed the doors of many federal agencies for 35 days and left 800,000 workers without pay. For weeks, Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky urged Mr. Trump not to declare a national emergency, but the president opted to go ahead anyway to find a way out of the political corner he had put himself in with the failed effort to force Congress to finance the wall. Mr. McConnell privately told the president that he would support the move despite his own reservations, but warned Mr. Trump that he had about two weeks to win over critical Republicans to avoid having Congress vote to reject the declaration. Mr. Trump was among those Republicans who criticized President Barack Obama for using his executive authority to spare millions of illegal immigrants from deportation after failing to persuade Congress to do so. “Repubs must not allow Pres Obama to subvert the Constitution of the US for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ Congress,” Mr. Trump tweeted in 2014. But Mr. Trump sought to drive home the personal toll of illegal immigration, inviting to the Rose Garden several relatives of Americans killed by people in the country without authorization. Some of the relatives, known as “angel moms,” stood up holding pictures of loved ones who had died. “Matthew’s death was preventable and should have been prevented,” one of the women, Maureen Maloney, said in an interview after the event. Her son Matthew Denice, 23, was killed in 2011 in a motorcycle accident in Massachusetts after colliding with an automobile driven by an undocumented immigrant. “He should have never been here in the first place,” she said. “If he wasn’t here, it wouldn’t have happened.”",1
107,"In an exclusive interview on OutletName' ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday night affirmed that the White House would reject any Democratic spending bill without funding for a border wall.
The vice president added that President Trump ""is in the process of evaluating"" whether to remove troops from Afghanistan, and vowed that the military's withdrawal from Syria will be conducted in an ""orderly fashion.""
Pence's comments came as the new House majority, which was sworn in earlier Thursday, debated an interim, stopgap spending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8. The bill, which was ultimately approved late Thursday by a 239 to 192 vote, does not include any new wall money, and Senate Republicans and the White House have both described it as a non-starter that will never become law. Five Republicans voted for the bill.
Another piece of legislation approved by the House late Thursday would fund six of the seven unresolved spending bills through Sept. 30. The bill was approved by a 241-190 vote at approximately 10 p.m. ET, with seven Republicans joining Democrats to vote yea. The measure, which the White House has also said will not become law, puts together six of the seven unresolved appropriations bills in one package.
""Democrats broke off negotiations about a week ago, but the president’s made it clear: We’re here to make a deal, but it’s a deal that’s going to result in achieving real gains on border security,"" Pence said. ""And, you have no border security without a wall. We will have no deal without a wall.
""What we’ve completely focused on is keeping the president’s promise, to build a wall, to pass legislation that provides other support for border security, that gives the people that are enforcing our laws at the border, and across the border -- enforcing our immigration laws, the resources and the tools that they need.""
The vice president pointed to a compromise floated during a legislative showdown over the summer, which would have provided enhanced statutory protections to so-called ""Dreamers,"" or illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. at a young age. The president had signaled support for the measure.
""There’s a lot of people talking about a lot of different ideas, you know frankly, the better part of a year ago, the president expressed a willingness to deal with the issue of Dreamers in a compassionate way,"" Pence said. ""People who were brought here as children, and through no fault of their own -- he’s discussed that, it’s being talked about.""
While U.S. authorities ""actually saw a decline in illegal immigration and incursions on our southern border"" in the early days of Trump's presidency, Pence said, ""in the last 12 months we’ve literally seen a dramatic increase ... 2,000 people a day [are] apprehended at our border or found to be inadmissible, trying to enter our country.""
The solution, Pence said, is a ""barrier,"" along with ""technology, drones, the kind of support that our border agents know will assist them in doing their job. But bottom line, if there’s no wall, there’s no deal.""
""But bottom line: If there’s no wall, there’s no deal."" — Vice President Mike Pence
Separately, Pence suggested that Trump's planned pullout from Syria was appropriate because terrorists there have been defeated -- but, he added, the fight against the Islamic State terror network will continue.
""The reality is we have defeated ISIS, we have defeated the caliphate,"" Pence said. ""And, what the president announced just before Christmas is not that we’re giving up on the fight of ISIS; we’re going to continue to lean into the fight on ISIS.""
Speaking to OutletName on Wednesday, Retired Army Col. Douglas MacGregor praised Trump's decision, saying U.S. overseas commitments have been a ""disaster"" for everyday Americans.
However, several top Republicans, including South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, have said Trump's initially planned 30-day pullout was too hasty. After speaking with Trump this week, Graham said that the president has agreed to slow the drawdown.
Asked whether Trump would similarly pursue an Afghanistan withdrawal, as he has reportedly been debating, Pence said only that the idea was under active consideration.
The potential maneuver would involve more than 3,000 U.S. troops getting pulled out, a senior U.S. official told OutletName in December. There are 15,000 troops currently on the ground in Afghanistan.
""Well, the president is in the process of evaluating that, as we speak,"" Pence said. ""I was in Afghanistan last year. In his speech in August, President Trump, basically through new rules of engagement, new resources, additional military personnel, gave our folks on the ground the ability to take the fight, be at the tip of the spear, supporting the Afghan National Army in the battle against the Taliban, ISIS, Khorasan, Al Qaeda, re-emerging in Afghanistan.""",0
988,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday got behind a bill to drastically cut legal immigration and replace current employment based visas with a point system. Under the plan – if approved by Congress, which will be a heavy lift – the highest point-getting candidate, for example, not including special circumstances, would be a 26- to 31-year-old with a US-based doctorate or professional degree, who speaks nearly perfect English and who has a salary offer that’s three times as high as the median income where they are. Have an Olympic medal or Nobel Prize? That will help too. A candidate must have at least 30 points to apply. Here’s how the points would be doled out: Age
Priority is given to prime working ages. Someone aged 18 through 21 gets six points, ages 22 through 25 gets eight points and ages 26 through 30 get 10 points. The points then decrease, with someone aged 31 through 35 getting eight points, 36 through 40 getting six points, ages 41 through 45 getting four points and ages 46 through 50 getting two points. Minors under the age of 18 and those over the age of 50 receive no points, though people over 50 years old are still allowed to apply. Education
Points are distributed based on the highest degree a person has achieved. One point is given for an applicant with a US high school diploma or the foreign equivalent. A foreign bachelor’s degree earns five points, while a US bachelor’s degree earns six points. A foreign master’s degree in STEM fields earns seven points while a US master’s earns eight points. A foreign professional degree or doctorate earns 10 points and a US equivalent earns 13. English ability
Points are also given out for English ability, as determined by standardized English test. Anyone with less than a 60th percentile proficiency gets no points. Between 60th and 80th percentile is worth six points, someone in the 80th to 90th percentile range earns 10 points, someone with a 90th percentile proficiency or above earns 11 points, and someone in the 100th percentile range earns 12 points. Job offer?
The only point scale that factors in whether an individual actually has a job offer in the US comes in the form of salary in an effort to boost wages. Five points are awarded if an applicant has a job offer that will pay at least 150% of median household income in the state where he or she will be employed. That goes up to eight points if the income is 200% the median income, and 13 points if it’s 300% the median. Nobel Prize
There are bonus points available for “extraordinary achievement,” mainly reserved for major international awards. The system grants 25 points to someone who has won a Nobel prize or something “comparable.” Olympics
Fifteen points would be given to someone earning an individual Olympic medal or relatively competitive international sporting event. Investors
The bill would eliminate a category of visas that spurred foreign investment in the US, the EB-5 program, which was used by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner’s family businesses to build major real estate projects. That concept is represented by awarding six points to an applicant who invests $1.35 million into a “new commercial enterprise” in the US, maintained for three years and with that individual holding management of that business as his or her primary application. The points go up to 12 if the investment is $1.8 million. Spouses
The bill also requires applicants, if they want to bring a spouse with them, to calculate the points the spouse would earn under the same rubric.",1
52,"If an army marches on its stomach, the forces at Fort Hamilton had better learn to cook. Eateries near the Brooklyn Army base, which handed over an undocumented pizza deliveryman to immigration agents last week, are now refusing to send their own workers into the garrison. “I won’t send my guys there anymore,” said Josefina Cardoso, owner of the El Puente restaurant in Bay Ridge. “I would feel guilty if something happened.” Cardoso, 45, a U.S. citizen born in Mexico, said she’d make the delivery herself if she had to — but other workers at the taco joint want to boycott the base over its treatment of Ecuadorian immigrant Pablo Villavicencio. “Some people tell their bosses ‘I’m not going,’ ” said cook and delivery guy Emanuel Kabrinny, 34. “I’m not going either. If they want food, let them come here [to pick it up].” Villavicencio, 35, wound up in immigration detention Friday after dropping off Italian food at the base — where officials refused to accept his IDNYC card as identification and then ran a background check, revealing he has an outstanding deportation order from 2010. Base officials told the press the father of two signed “a waiver” for the background check — but he says that is “a lie.” “I am 100 percent sure that I did not sign any document there,” Villavicencio told The New York Post in a phone interview from immigration detention. The manager of the Queens pizzeria where Villavicencio works said one guard just “had it out for him.” “That’s what this is all about,” the manager of Nonna Delia’s in College Point, who wouldn’t give his name, said. Other local delivery guys said the guards rarely check for any ID. “They don’t ask us for ID,” said Juan Salvador, 38, an immigrant from Guatemala who delivers for Fourth Avenue deli Goustaro. But his manager said she, too, is now afraid to send undocumented food couriers into the federal facility. “We’re kind of afraid to send someone to the Army base this morning, and what’s the first call? From the Army base,” said Chris Moustakas, 35, a manager of the family-owned bagel joint. Meanwhile, Villavicencio’s possible deportation has turned into a political football ahead of the upcoming state primary, with Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday offering him free legal representation. “Detaining a hardworking man, separating a father from his children and tearing apart communities doesn’t make America safe, and a wrong-minded immigration policy grounded in bias and cruelty doesn’t make America great,” Cuomo said of the married father of two young girls.",0
1618,"Last week and over the weekend, American business leaders, including Mr. Zalesne, stepped into the political fray and urged Mr. Trump to extend DACA. More than 400 of them signed a letter to the president and congressional leaders, warning that such immigrants — brought to the United States as children and known as “Dreamers” — are vital to the economy.
Some of the most vocal supporters of DACA are in the tech industry. On Saturday, Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, updated the profile picture on his Facebook page to say, “I Support DACA.” The chief executive of Apple, Timothy D. Cook, proclaimed on Twitter that “250 of my Apple coworkers are #Dreamers. I stand with them.”
But executives at big companies outside of the tech sector spoke up, too. The chairman and chief executive of Best Buy, Hubert Joly, wrote on the company’s blog on Friday, “There are hundreds of thousands of young men and women whose futures are at stake.”
Other signers of the letter to Mr. Trump, titled an “Open Letter From Leaders of American Industry,” included executives from Hewlett-Packard, General Motors, Marriott and Wells Fargo and the investor Warren E. Buffett. The letter campaign was organized by the group Fwd.us, which urges changes in immigration law and was founded by tech leaders including Mr. Zuckerberg.
The campaign to save DACA is the latest extension of the business world’s willingness to weigh in on a divisive issue. Last month, executives at some of the nation’s largest companies criticized Mr. Trump’s initial response to the role of white supremacists in the violence in Charlottesville, Va.
On DACA, the executives are taking a pragmatic approach. While many immigration advocates have focused on humanitarian issues, the executives focused on the economic toll.
According the letter from the executives, 65 percent of Dreamers have bought a car and 16 percent have purchased their own home. This economic activity, they argue, would be eliminated if the Dreamers were deported.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, estimates that five years after a repeal of DACA, the nation’s gross domestic product would be $105 billion less than it would be if the program stays in place.
“The Dreamers are on track to be a highly educated group, and losing them will be a significant blow to businesses already struggling to find educated and skilled young workers,” Mr. Zandi wrote in an email on Monday.
Mr. Zalesne said he was not sure how many, if any, of the 295 workers at his company’s facilities, which fabricate steel for projects like the rebuilding of the World Trade Center site, are protected by DACA.
He decided to take a stand, he said, not only because of the economic implications, but also because he could not ignore the human toll that deportation would take on people who have been working and going to school legally and have mostly known only one country — the United States.
“They have been trying to do the right thing,” he said.",1
615,"The President of the United States exercises significant fiscal power in signing an executive order, and last year, President Trump signed more than any president in a quarter century.
What are the financial costs of the president’s immigration policies that are being implemented without review and approval from Congress? How shall we grade the president on his spending choices? Do his financial expenditures meet your expectations and budget priorities?
You should care about this. It is your money being spent.
Trump says we need to spend more to stop the MS-13 criminal gang from entering the United States, but he is shelling out billions of your hard-earned tax dollars targeting foreign national students, engineers, postdoctoral researchers, scientists, and entrepreneurs.
He is using your money to deport parents with U.S. citizen children and spouses, even if they have no criminal record; we are paying for it and failing to receive the return that was promised. The costs are staggering in taxpayer contributions, lost human capital and lost opportunity.
If you do nothing else, consider this when you vote:
In alignment with Trump’s policy of stepping up immigrant detentions, a record-smashing 13,000 children are now in federal custody (a fivefold increase over last year). Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reports it has cost upwards of $775 per bed each day to keep these children locked up.
Some may applaud the president’s effort to not let a single child be released until the fullest possible extent of misery has been doled out, but I say this is nuts.
Does HHS spending $458 million of your money in a year to pay a contractor to incarcerate children between the ages of six months and 17 years make any sense? Why is this a good thing for America? What is the benefit to our national security?
It gets worse.
Our president has decided to end Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands of Latinos and Haitians legally residing in the United States. He is using DACA recipients as pawns, threatening to deport millions of Dreamers if he does not get his wall.
The Immigrant Legal Resource Center at Harvard Law School found that deporting all Salvadoran, Honduran and Haitian TPS holders would cost taxpayers $3.1 billion, resulting in a $6.9 billion reduction to Social Security and Medicare contributions and lead to a $45.2 billion reduction in GDP over a decade.
The conservative CATO Institute estimates that ending DACA would cost our economy another $200 billion.
Disturbing? Consider this: in June, Trump stated that undocumented immigrants should be immediately returned “from where they came” with “no judges or court cases.” What? The Fifth Amendment states that “no person … shall be … deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.”
The Fourteenth Amendment grants to any person within the jurisdiction of the United States “the equal protection of the laws.”
Over the past six months, the president and his senior advisor Stephen Miller, who reportedly enjoyed watching children ripped from parents’ arms at the border, have intentionally violated the Constitution by deporting asylum seekers without a hearing; by separating families without due process; and by committing intentional infliction of emotional distress without providing equal protection of the laws.
Their strategy is backfiring, costing taxpayers millions as lawsuits are being filed to force President Trump to respect the Constitution, which he took an oath to do.
All of this doesn’t happen in a vacuum. The Trump administration just diverted $260 million from cancer research, HIV/AIDS prevention, and the Medicare and Medicaid programs to cover the costs of the president’s immigration agenda.
This must be part of Trump’s “fantastic,” “incredible,” “huge,” financial wisdom and decision-making, which he says are taking our country to new heights.
In reality, this is the kind of lip service a billionaire president pays to the everyday people who fund an immigration agenda grounded in mean-spiritedness, deception, and fiscal insanity — all to recruit and pacify the worst elements of our society.
So, if nothing else, think of your wallet when you vote.

2044,"White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told a meeting of Democratic lawmakers that President Donald Trump’s campaign pledges to curb immigration ― including his promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border ― were uninformed, and that such a structure was unlikely to happen in full, according to multiple media reports.
Kelly made the comments to members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Wednesday in a closed-door session that was first reported by The Washington Post. His comments were confirmed by Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.), who was at the meeting.
“I can confirm that Chief of Staff Kelly said today that the President’s campaign was not fully informed about the wall he was promising to voters,” Gutiérrez said in a statement. “Kelly went on to say that many campaigns are not fully informed about every policy and that campaigning and governing are two different things and that governing is harder.”
Gutiérrez also went on to confirm reporting by OutletName that Kelly took credit as the “one who tempered” Trump’s more extreme opinions on the wall and the viability of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals initiative, also known as DACA.
“Kelly took credit for educating the President on the wall and that a concrete barrier from sea to shining sea was no longer the conception of border security barriers supported today by the White House,” Gutiérrez said.
During the meeting, Kelly said he was optimistic about the prospect of a DACA deal and that the president was “committed to a permanent solution,” according to the Post. Kelly later told reporters that he believed an agreement would “be worked out” by Congress.
The comments put one of Trump’s most senior aides at odds with the president’s recent statements continuing to stump his wall. Trump insisted that Mexico would still pay for the construction in an interview last week with OutletName, although he clarified that it would pay “indirectly” through the North American Free Trade Agreement.",1
1154,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan on Sunday said 350 migrant children remain in US Customs and Border Protection custody -- down from 2,500 last month -- after Congress passed a $4.6 billion border funding bill allowing CBP to shift more children into the Department of Health and Human Services' shelter system.
""On June 1 we have 2,500 children in our custody; 1,200 had been with us over three days. Now that we have the supplemental from Congress, HHS has additional beds. We only have 350 after yesterday afternoon's report and only 20 of those children have been with us more than three days so that's a huge improvement based on the resources we asked for from Congress and were finally given,"" McAleenan said on OutletName's ""This Week.""
McAleenan was also asked about the discovery of a second CPB-connected secret Facebook group that featured mocking images and vulgar and sexually explicit posts
The roughly 1,000-member group -- called ""The Real CBP Nation"" -- was found to host to an image that mocks separating migrant families , multiple demeaning images of New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other mocking photos of minorities.
McAleenan said Sunday he wasn't previously aware of the group, but that he was ""made aware that we had an allegation in 2016 that was investigated, followed up on and discipline was metered out."" He said that ""several agents"" have been placed on ""administrative duties"" and that an investigation is ongoing.
""This investigation is continuing and the agents will be held accountable if they're CBP employees who did inappropriate things,"" he said. ""I don't think it's reflective of the men and women we have.""
When asked about immigration raids by ICE -- an operation that President Donald Trump said his administration would launch sometime after the Fourth of July , McAleenan said they were part of a ""balance enforcement process.""
""You can't do this all at the border. That's why I've been going down to Central America to work on the origins of this crisis and address the human smugglers that are incentivizing and inviting people into this dangerous cycle in the first place,"" McAleenan said. ""That's why we're enhancing our border security, that's why we've asked Congress to change the laws, but it's also why we need to do interior enforcement.""",1
1149,"One shows a mother, her child, and a Mexican National Guardsman, with whom she's pleading to allow her to cross into the US.
In that image, taken by OutletName photographer Jose Luis Gonzalez, the mother -- identified by the photographer as Lety Perez -- is seen squatting on a dirt road. She covers her face with her hand, hiding her tears. Her other arm is wrapped around her 6-year-old son, Anthony, who is looking up at the guardsman.

The images are the latest in an increasing number of wrenching photos coming from the southern border, depicting both the difficulty of crossing into the US and the migrants' desperation.
Gonzalez, the photographer of the latest series, spoke to OutletName about the photos, how he captured them, and the people at the center of the crisis.
Tell us about the assignment that led you to these migrants
On Monday morning, I was asked for images of the border and the National Guard. I was walking along the border until dusk because I was hoping to catch the moment when some migrant crosses or was stopped by officers. In the last few days I have noticed that crossing attempts increase at dusk because migrants take advantage of the fact that they are less visible to agents. However, I did not expect the scene I found.
Who are they? What was their story? What happened to them after this moment?
Her name is Lety Perez and her son's Anthony Diaz, he is 6 years old. Both are migrants from Guatemala. She left her country hoping to give her son a better future. She said she was a single mother; Anthony's father abandoned her when he was 9 months old and never helped them. She had spent everything she had to get to the border, she cried and implored National Guard officers to let her cross. She asked them not to send her back to her country. Finally, in an oversight of the officer in front of her, she ran into the Rio Bravo (which is dry and full of weeds) and turned herself in to the Border Patrol who was on the other side arresting the migrants that had crossed before.
Was this scene typical of what you're encountering on the Mexican side of the border?
Yes, ever since the National Guard is at the border. Before, there was no one on the Mexican side to prevent migrants from crossing, now there are officers almost every 100 meters. At first, I saw them trying to hold the migrants physically to prevent them from crossing and handing them over to the Migration Institute, now they just stand in front as if creating a barrier. The vast majority of the women who cross the border are accompanied by their children, sometimes even the men. Although they do not always break into tears, they do ask GN to let them continue their journey.
Did the Mexican guards say anything about the moment?
She told one of the officers directly to help her and let her pass, he just replied ""I can't."" Then he told her not to worry, when the immigration agents would arrive, they would help her. She asked him if they would take her back to her country and he told her again to wait for Immigration (when they intercepted her, they radioed agents from the Migration Institute who also guard the border). When Mrs. Perez managed to cross to the US side, several Mexican officers met at the point where they had stopped her, I don't know what they talked about.
Anything else you'd like known?
I'd like to know what happened to her. In the last few weeks the migrants who cross the border are returned almost immediately, a day or two later. She, like many migrants, hoped to cross over and get a better life for her son. I don't know what she thinks now, knowing that she will be returned to Mexico to wait for a court date.
The photo illustrates Mexico's new role
The photo shows the role Mexico is now playing in the migrant crisis.
President Donald Trump in June suspended threatened tariffs on Mexican goods after reaching an agreement with the Mexican government. The tariffs were meant to put pressure on the Mexican government to do more in stemming the flow of migrants from Central America who are crossing Mexico's border into the US.
The deal came after Mexico already pledged to send 6,000 National Guard troops to its border with Guatemala to hinder migrant movement. But the new agreement had Mexico stepping up its border patrol throughout the country.
All of this comes a year after Mexico elected a new president, leftist Andrés Manuel López Obrador. The new president, who came into power in December, said on the campaign trail that Mexico wouldn't do ""dirty work"" for the United States when it came to immigration enforcement. But since taking office his tone has shifted, and he's largely accommodated Trump's demands on immigration.",1
225,"After years of surging immigration from Central America, law enforcement in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley are finally seeing some relief, thanks in part to President Trump’s strong rhetoric.
“Words matter,” said Christopher Sabatini, an expert in Latin American affairs at Columbia University in New York City. “The rhetoric has mattered. There is a sense of fear that immigrant families, without legal status, without papers are going to be sent back down.”
That fear prompted a dramatic change in behavior among illegal immigrants that few predicted. For three years, a flood of unaccompanied children, women and families made the hazardous trek north from Hondurans, El Salvador and Guatemala, through Mexico to the U.S. Border. Now they are not coming.
“We’re at a trickle,” said Chris Cabrera, with the National Border Council. “It hasn’t stopped but it’s slowed considerably that we’re at a point where we have empty cells now.”
SESSIONS: BORDER CROSSINGS DOWN 60 PERCENT DUE TO 'TRUMP'S STRONG LEADERSHIP'
That added bed space is allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold immigrants longer. Previously, Central American immigrants turned themselves in, claimed asylum and were released.
In most cases, the Obama Administration accommodated the claim by placing the applicant on a court docket with a two- to three-year waiting list. In the meantime, most illegal immigrants were free to work while living with relatives. Some set down roots by getting married or having American-born children.
President Trump promised to end that ’catch and release’ policy, saying “anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country.”
Apparently that message got through thousands of miles away.
“Since January, we have seen a significant decrease in traffic to the point we’re averaging about 150 alien apprehensions a day,” down from as many as 1,000 a day, according to Deputy Chief Raul Ortiz of the Rio Grande Border Patrol Sector. “A big part of the decrease, I think, has to do with a lot of the discussion about the buildup of infrastructure on the southwest border, more agents along the border and some of the message making its way down to those host countries.”
DHS' KELLY DEFENDS MORE ICE, BORDER HIRES; SAYS ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS MUST BE 'DEALT WITH'
And with traffic down, more enforcement means higher smuggling costs, detained immigrants tell the Border Patrol.
“If you think that you are not going to be able to stay with relatives, you are not going to spend $8 to $9,000 to cross just to get caught and sent back,” said Border Patrol agent Marlene Castro while overlooking the once busy Rio Grande.
Border Patrol numbers tell the story. Since the election, apprehensions have fallen every month, from 15,000 families and unaccompanied minors in November to just over 1,000 today.
Cabrera believes media reports surrounding ICE arrests, the proposed wall and the president’s vows to enforce the law scared many illegal immigrants into staying home.
“The media has a big say in what happens,” he said. “They put that out there and people come or don’t come, depending on what they say.”
The same holds true, he said, of President Obama. Though his administration also vowed to deport most illegal immigrants and even produced an expensive ad campaign in Central America urging residents to stay home, the headlines told a different story – of immigrants getting temporary amnesty and freedom from custody for those claiming asylum. By contrast, President Trump hasn’t actually done much.
“Without any real concrete changes in policies, without any real tightening of the border wall, without any of the $1.5 billion worth of increased funding yet for Homeland Security and the border guard, we are seeing the numbers that it is having an effect on people’s calculation of the risk of crossing the border illegally,” said Sabatini.
The administration has elaborate plans to strengthen both the border and the court system to diminish the ‘pull’ factors in illegal immigration.
So far, the Department of Justice has reassigned 25 judges from the interior to the border to help streamline the process and keep immigrants in custody until their asylum claims are completed.",0
843,"OutletName and Politico both issued dubious fact-checks on President Donald Trump’s Tuesday night State of the Union address.
Trump’s address had a theme of “choosing greatness,” and began with a call for unity. He went on to share the successes of his administration. He also implored Congress to act on immigration, prescription drug pricing, trade and infrastructure among other issues.
At one point while discussing illegal immigration, Trump said, “One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.”
Politico immigration reporter Ted Hesson fact-checked that claim and rated it “partially true.”
Here’s Hesson’s explanation for the rating: “A 2017 report by Doctors Without Borders found 31 percent of female migrants and 17 percent of male migrants said they had been sexually abused while traveling through Mexico.”
So, Politico ruled Trump claiming 33.3 percent of women who make the trek from Central America to the U.S. get sexual assaulted on the way is only “partially true,” because the percentage he shared was off by 2.3 percent. In one of the more enthusiastic moments of Trump’s SOTU address, he said, “And exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.”
Democrats proceeded to stand up and clap. Cheers of “USA! USA!” also erupted.
“That’s great. Very great. And congratulations. That’s great,” Trump continued.
OutletName fact-checked Trump’s claim about having “more women serving in Congress than at any time before.”
“There are more women in Congress than ever before, but that is almost entirely because of Democrats, not Trump’s party. The number of Republican women in the House has, in fact, fallen from 23 in the last Congress to 13 in this one ,” their fact-check read. “Altogether, there are 127 women in Congress, up from 110 in 2018. But even with that large jump, women remain hugely underrepresented on Capitol Hill — less than 1 in 4 members of Congress is a woman. (Meanwhile, women are the majority of voters .)”
So, OutletName “fact-checked” the president’s statement about the number of women in Congress by saying that it’s a result of the opposition party, not that the statement he made was false.",0
1847,"With the clock running out on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), the fate of thousands of immigrants now rests in the hands of Congress. As they debate whether to grant these young people the right to remain in the only home they have ever known, lawmakers would do well to keep in mind that the nation – indeed the world – is watching. DACA Dreamers are citizens in all respects, but for their immigration status. We raised them, imbued them with our values and made them part of our culture and our very future. Most Americans agree that their unique situation calls for a compassionate and forward-looking solution.
French writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry once said, “You become responsible, forever, for whom you have tamed.” Five years ago, President Obama acknowledged our responsibility to the nation’s Dreamers by issuing an Executive Order to offer a modest piece of the American Dream to children who were brought to this country while very young, were raised here, and long ago lost whatever ties they may have had to the countries of their parents’ origin. At the same time, we took a pragmatic approach. DACA was not a path to citizenship, it was temporary, and applicants had to prove that they deserved the opportunity. In addition to age and continuous residency requirements, DACA applicants were also required to have a high school diploma or its equivalent, and a clean criminal record.
The vast majority of those who applied for DACA benefits were granted temporary status. They have become professionals, they have served in the U.S. military, they have been integrated into American society, and they have contributed to our prosperity.
President Trump has reassured us that he has a great heart. Yet action has not followed those words. In fact, last week the heads of Homeland Security under three previous Administrations implored Congress to act within the next few weeks due to the many complexities involved in finalizing any DACA legislation. If not, it will be too late. The lives of 800,000 DACA recipients and the millions of family members who depend upon them will be thrown into chaos and uncertainty. The many thousands of companies that employ Dreamers will be severely negatively impacted. The consequences for our nation will be devastating -- to our economy, to public safety, to the character of our communities, and to our moral stature around the world.
The United States has been skirting the issue of its undocumented children long enough. Any attempt to deport almost a million law abiding, productive, talented, and accomplished people who once were granted hope to live up to their dreams will not go unchallenged. My colleagues and I will do everything legally possible to help our Dreamers. We are fortunate to live in a country that is governed by the rule of law. DACA recipients cannot be deported without having their day in immigration court and we will do everything in our power to make sure that all 800,000 of them are properly represented.",1
1848,"This past April, the President signed the “Buy American and Hire American” (BAHA) executive order directing the Department of State (DOS, Department of Justice (DOJ), Department of Labor (DOL), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees the U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) to “suggest reforms” that would ensure “H-1B visas are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid petition beneficiaries.”[1] The order makes no immediate changes to the work visa program but instructs the federal agencies to “propose new rules and issue new guidance,” and to supersede existing guidance “if appropriate.”[2]
The H-1B visa program is one of the most heavily used employment visas by employers in the United States. The program allows U.S. companies to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations, which include jobs in technology, engineering, science, architecture, accounting, and business, amongst others. Many of the most notable and profitable tech companies, including Microsoft, Google, and Apple, hire large numbers of H-1B workers. Each year, 85,000 (65,000 for individuals who possess at least a bachelor’s degree in a specialized field of study, and 20,000 for individuals who possess at least a master’s or higher degree issued by a U.S. college or university) H-1Bs are available to companies, according to a ceiling set by Congress. The visa remains valid for three years with extensions available up to six years however, H-1B holders who have begun the employment based green card process can renew their visas indefinitely under certain circumstances. Although it is difficult to determine exactly how many people in the U.S. are currently on H-1B visas, analysts estimate there around 650,000 to 900,000 recipients. [3]
USCIS and DOS officials are more closely scrutinizing H-1B visa petitions and have been denying the petitions and H-1B visa applications more frequently since the issuance of BAHA. Foreign nationals already in the United States whose employers wish to extend their visas are also facing challenges. From January to August 2017, the number of Requests for Evidence (RFE) issued by USCIS on H-1Bs petitions increased by 44% when compared to the same period last year.[4] Furthermore, for the first two months of October and November 2017, 86% and 82% of H-1B petitions were approved when compared to 93% and 92% for the same period last year. [5] Ben Johnson, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association comments, “The goal of the administration seems to be to grind the process to a halt or slow it down so much that they achieve a reduction in legal immigration through implementation rather legislation.”
Another recent change to employment-based petitions is the newly required interview. As of October 1, 2017, USCIS began conducting in-person interviews of applicants who apply to adjust their status to that of lawful permanent resident based on an approved immigrant petition (Form I-140). Visa holders who are derivative beneficiaries of the principal (spouse and children under 21 years of age), refugees or asylees have also been required to undergo in-person interviews when they apply for lawful permanent residence.
Although the in-person interview is not a new procedure, the USCIS has been waiving the interview requirement for nearly all employment-based adjustment of status applications because the interviews tended to cause a significant backlog in case processing and waste valuable resources (personnel, time and funding). According to the USCIS Office of Public Engagement (OPE), which held a teleconference on October 11, 2017, entitled “Expanded Use of In-Person Interviews,” applicants for adjustment of status should expect significantly longer processing times as the USCIS begins scheduling applicants and their derivative beneficiaries for interviews.
As an employment based immigration firm, our clients have faced a heightened number of H-1B RFEs as well as scheduled interviews for their adjustment of status applications. These policy changes have and will continue to cause significant disruption and hardship for many individuals. Employers wishing to hire employees through the H-1B program may now be forced to hire unqualified workers or wait indefinite periods for their employees to receive work authorization. For those required to attend USCIS interviews, both the principal applicant and his/her spouse must now take at least half a day off from their jobs and those with children have lost at least half a day of school.",1
1982,"While six previous presidents declared dozens of national emergencies, Donald Trump’s threatened one over a border wall would be the first to finance an unpopular construction project that congresses both in his own country and in a neighboring one have refused to pay for.
Trump has been warning for months that he would declare an emergency if Congress failed to appropriate $5.7 billion for a wall along the border with Mexico, and he repeated the threat at a re-election rally in El Paso, Texas, Monday night. “As I was walking up to the stage, they said that progress is being made with this committee,” he said of a bipartisan deal that would provide $1.375 billion for border barriers. “Just so you know, we’re building the wall anyway.”
For Trump, though, choosing to declare a national emergency would likely trigger a law from Congress finding his declaration invalid, lawsuits challenging its legality or both.
“The National Emergencies Act does not give the president the authority to throw a tantrum just because Congress chooses not to give him the toys that he likes,” said Greg Chen, the head of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.
“I’m sure the legal challenges would be filed instantly,” said Elizabeth Goitein, an expert on national emergencies at the Brennan Center for Justice.
Of late, Trump and his allies have argued that national emergencies are nothing extraordinary, that every previous president going back to the passage of the National Emergencies Act in 1976 has used it and that nearly three dozen are still in force.
On Sunday he tweeted to his 58 million followers a statement from Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.): “There have been 58 National Emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976, and 31 right now that are currently active, so this is hardly unprecedented.”
Yet what the White House and Trump’s defenders do not mention is that no previous president has declared a national emergency for a pet project that most Americans oppose, that Congress has refused to support and that he promised during his campaign that he would force Mexico to pay for.
The National Emergencies Act does not give the president the authority to throw a tantrum just because Congress chooses not to give him the toys that he likes. Greg Chen, American Immigration Lawyers Association
Douglas Rivlin, a spokesman for the pro-immigration group America’s Voice, said Trump is primarily trying to work up his hard-core base by painting immigrants as criminals, just as he did in the weeks leading up to the November midterm elections.
Rivlin added that it was ironic that an absurd campaign promise has now become the singular focus of his administration. “It’s always been a joke. It’s always been a promise that didn’t make sense,” he said. “It was an applause line. And yet it is driving national policy at this point.”
Of course, Trump did not offhandedly joke about forcing Mexico to pay for a massive, 30-foot-tall, reinforced concrete wall. He promised that he would force Mexico to pay for it — literally hundreds of times in his rallies, and even in interviews when he was asked whether he was serious.
In a March 2016 memo, Trump claimed he would force Mexico to make “a one-time payment of $5-$10 billion” or face garnishment of remittances from Mexican immigrants to their families in Mexico.
“That fit into his brand of being this master negotiator able to make people do what they didn’t want to do,” Rivlin said. “But even that was being pulled out of his ample presidential butt.”
Upon taking office, Trump did not once broach the idea of Mexico paying in his conversations with that country’s leaders, according to the Mexican government. In fact, in his first conversation with Mexico’s then-President Enrique Peña Nieto days after taking office, Trump acknowledged that Mexico would never pay for the wall but asked Peña Nieto not to say that publicly to avoid hurting Trump’s standing with his supporters.
After that phone call, more than a year passed before Trump started demanding a wall, only this time from U.S. taxpayers and Congress, which led to his claims starting in October that he had the power simply to ignore Congress.
“When the rules don’t suit him, he breaks the rules, and then it gets tied up in courts,” Rivlin said. “This has been the pattern of his life.”
At issue is the exclusive role given to Congress in the Constitution to decide whether and how much to spend for any given priority, Chen said.
That fit into his brand of being this master negotiator able to make people do what they didn’t want to do. But even that was being pulled out of his ample presidential butt. Douglas Rivlin, spokesman, America’s Voice
All but a handful of the previous five dozen emergency declarations over the past four decades have imposed trade restrictions or other economic sanctions against nations for their aggressive behavior and human rights abuses.
A May 22, 1997, declaration by Bill Clinton prohibited new investment in Burma. An April 3, 2014, declaration by Barack Obama imposed sanctions on leaders of South Sudan. The very first emergency — which is in place to this day — was declared by Jimmy Carter to impose sanctions on Iran after the 1979 revolution.
Only a handful of the declarations have dealt with national policy outside of targeted sanctions. One, declared by Ronald Reagan in 1983, reinstated a ban on the export of technologies that could be used for military purposes. Congress had allowed the ban to lapse but did not oppose his use of the Emergencies Act to put it back into force.
Another came in 2005, when George W. Bush, without technically declaring an emergency, decreed the suspension of a requirement to pay workers involved in the Hurricane Katrina recovery a certain minimum wage. Democrats and some Republicans did object to that one, and set a vote in the House to disapprove it. Bush rescinded his decree the day before the scheduled vote.
Not one of the previous emergencies, however, did anything close to what Trump is trying to do: pay for a project not only without Congress’ approval, but after Congress has specifically rejected his request several times.
“The law was intended to authorize a president to take action in a crisis that was unfolding too quickly for Congress to respond,” Chen said. “Congress has, in fact, made a decision. Congress has chosen not to give him the funds that he would like.”
It is not clear if or when Trump would actually declare an emergency. Republican senators have already expressed their fears that enough of them would side with Democrats on the issue that a law rescinding the emergency would clear Congress, forcing Trump to back down or veto it — a choice that would likely lead to an attempt to override the veto. White House officials would say only that Trump is considering all his options and that he would do everything necessary to deal with the “crisis” at the border.
Chen, though, said that Trump’s actions — threatening an emergency, but only if Congress refused to give him what he wanted — have undermined the legal basis for one.",1
1004,"The Trump administration is making an additional 30,000 seasonal worker visas available for 2019, according to a joint rule published Monday by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Labor.
The additional visas come on top of the visas already made available for the year.
The work visas, which allow employers to hire foreign workers for temporary, non-agricultural jobs, will only be available to workers who already received H-2B status in the past three fiscal years. Availability is also restricted to businesses who would ""suffer irreparable harm"" without the additional workers, US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced on Monday.
The increase was expected, as USCIS alerted Capitol Hill in April that it intended to make this decision and the rule would be forthcoming.
In March, a group of senators asked Homeland Security to raise the number of available visas above the 66,000 statutory annual cap. The demand for seasonal workers was ""so extreme"" this year that the Labor Department's website almost crashed, according to a letter sent to then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.",1
800,"West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin is bucking the Democratic Party, announcing that he will vote for legislation funding a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
“Today I will vote for both gov funding bills b/c I believe we must end this harmful shutdown immediately & it’s our first opportunity in the Senate to do so,” the Democrat tweeted Thursday. “Even though they will probably fail, these votes are a start to finding a way to reopen the gov & get WVians back to work.”
Today I will vote for both gov funding bills b/c I believe we must end this harmful shutdown immediately & it’s our first opportunity in the Senate to do so. Even though they will probably fail, these votes are a start to finding a way to reopen the gov & get WVians back to work — Senator Joe Manchin (_JoeManchin) January 24, 2019
The Senate will vote on two sharply different funding bills Thursday. First, lawmakers will vote on a GOP-backed bill that includes $5.7 billion the president has requested to fund his border wall and protections for some migrants. Following that vote, lawmakers will then decide on a Democratic-led budget proposal that does not include funding for the wall.
Both bills are expected to fail.
Despite Republicans holding a 53-seat majority, Senate rules require at least 60 votes for budget bills, and Democrats have remained steadfast in their opposition to the border wall. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have agreed to allow both bills to receive a floor vote in hopes that it will be a step toward a compromise.
Manchin is not the only lawmaker who will vote in favor of both bills. Republican Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine indicated they plan to vote for both bills, stressing the necessity to open the government and let federal employees finally receive a paycheck.
Thursday marked the 34th day since the federal government entered a partial government shutdown. While some lawmakers in both the Senate and House have floated compromises, both parties have remained deadlocked on funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Democrats maintain they want to fund the government before border security negations can continue. Trump on Saturday extended an olive branch to Democrats, offering Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) protections for “Dreamers” and extended legal status for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders in exchange for a wall, but that offer was flatly rejected by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.",0
670,"Vice President Mike Pence sat down with OutletName host Tucker Carlson on Thursday night and revealed that approximately 2,000 people are apprehended trying to enter the country illegally each day.
“I want the American people to know that this is a real crisis at our border. We made progress last year. It probably was a result of the fact that the American people elected a new president who delivered a very strong message about confronting illegal immigration. We actually saw a decline in illegal immigration and incursions on the southern border,” Pence began.
“In the last 12 months, we have literally seen a dramatic increase in the number. 2,000 people a day apprehended at our border or found to be inadmissible trying to enter our country,” he continued. “That represents, as much as we were all troubled about the caravans moving north and there’s talk about more caravans. Literally 2,000 people a day attempt to come into this country illegally by one means or another.”
The Vice President added, “We can agree on those facts, come together around solutions. But part of that solution means a wall, it means a barrier along our southern border. And it also means technology, drones, the kind of support that our border agents know will assist them in doing their job. But, bottom line, if there is no wall, there is no deal.” 
As Pence referenced, the president has been adamant that he would not agree to any deal to end the partial government shutdown if there is no money allocated for a wall along the southern border.",0
2011,"""More than three decades ago, two white autoworkers fatally beat Chinese-American Vincent Chin in Detroit with a baseball bat.
The Japanese auto industry had begun booming then. And the workers, Ronald Ebens and his stepson Michael Nitz, had mistaken Chin to be a Japanese man, blaming him for the loss of jobs in the U.S.
“It’s because of you little motherfkers that we’re out of work,” witnesses heard Ebens say.
Chin died four days later ― just days before his wedding.
“It often feels like we have not learned from our past mistakes as a nation.”
As activists look back on the tragedy on Monday, the 35th anniversary of Chin’s death, experts say they see parallels between the xenophobic sentiments of then and now ― related to perceiving Asians as perpetual foreigners, and insecurity over jobs. Today, this manifests itself in hate crimes against Asian-Americans and the targeting of the minority group in FBI espionage cases.
However, the incident also electrified a generation of Asian-Americans to speak out for civil rights, Wang said. Now, nonprofits are calling on members of the minority to continue the work of what the previous generation started and build relationships with other activist communities so that an incident like this can never happen again.
Modern-Day Hate Violence Against Asian-Americans Tied To Anti-Immigrant Sentiment
Since Chin’s death, there’s been no shortage of hate targeting the Asian-American community ― particularly in recent years during which there’s been a resurgence of violence.
Last year, the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations released a report on 2015 hate crimes which showed that those committed against Asian-Americans had tripled from six to 18 in that county alone. Most of them targeted people of Chinese descent.
“In the seven months since the election, there have been hundreds if not thousands of reports of hate-related attacks, linked to anti-immigrant, anti-China, and anti-Muslim sentiments.”
What’s more, members of the South Asian-American community have experienced an “unprecedented” resurgence of hate violence. The violence was “electrified” by the election cycle and comparable to levels seen the September 11 attacks, nonprofit South Asian Americans Leading Together, said of a study from the group. And the majority of the acts documented in the report were fueled by anti-Muslim sentiment.
Discrimination of Asian-Americans has also come from the government. A new report released by the Committee of 100, a Chinese-American nonprofit, showed that those of Asian descent might have been unfairly treated in economic espionage cases. Those from the minority group were charged with the crime at a higher rate than any other ethnic group. But they were also found to be innocent at a rate two times higher than individuals from any other race. And when they were found guilty, those with Asian-sounding names were given sentences that were twice as long as people with Western-sounding names.
How ‘Make America Great Again’ Makes ‘Go Back To China’ Acceptable
“I have seen from case after case after case ... that people continue to mistake us [Asian-Americans] for foreigners no matter how hard we assimilate and show our loyalty.”
To many experts, Trump’s rhetoric hearkens back to the motivations behind Chin’s murder.
This can also be seen in the espionage cases.
“I have seen from case after case after case ... that people continue to mistake us [Asian-Americans] for foreigners no matter how hard we assimilate and show our loyalty,” he said.
Blame often gets misplaced when discussing national security as well, Kohli said. She explained that political leaders have made irresponsible blanket statements, deeming Muslims as national security threats. In turn, innocent members of the faith been targeted by hate as well as those even perceived to be Muslim. This includes a number of Sikh-Americans.
“Fear gives rise to hate which gives rise to violence,” Wang concluded of the hate crimes.
Vincent Chin Anniversary Should Galvanize Asian-Americans To Speak Out Today, Experts Say
Experts say that while it feels like we may have even regressed since the murder, the incident galvanized the Asian-American community to vocalize their issues. They not only elevated their own voices, but also partnered across racial groups in the fight for civil rights, creating diverse coalitions. And Wang says that in the current political climate, the group must continue to do so.
“No one has the right to challenge our participation of democracy and American life.""
“The siloing of perspectives and communities, whether through language barriers or social media ‘rabbit holes,’ is a large part of what feeds the fear that leads to hate attacks,” she said. “One way to fight this siloing is through programs that deliberately bring together diverse communities to dialogue and learn from each other.”
And ultimately, it’s about letting the public know that America doesn’t belong to any one group.""",1
1693,"Some families were detained under the bridge for as long as four days, the A.C.L.U. said, adding that families with infant children were told to sleep on the ground and were not provided with any bedding, mats or chairs.
“We are demanding an immediate investigation by the inspector general into abuses inflicted on asylum seekers by Border Patrol agents in the outdoor facilities,” said Shaw Drake, policy counsel for the A.C.L.U.’s border rights center.
Migrants have since been transferred to undisclosed locations, he said, adding that “the agency has not told us or members of Congress where migrants are now being held and under what conditions.”
Local political leaders and human rights groups said that a sharp increase in asylum seekers should have been foreseeable, as part of an annual surge in border crossings before the arrival of the deadly summer heat.
Immigration officials were already scrambling to respond to a shifting profile of migrants arriving at the border with Mexico. Border Patrol apprehensions remain well below their peak of 1.6 million in 2000, but they have been climbing lately, reaching 467,000 in 2018, the highest figure in six years. And more of them are now Central American families seeking asylum rather than single men from Mexico.
Federal immigration officials claim that legal rulings have created loopholes that make it more attractive for Central Americans to apply for asylum in the United States.
“This status quo is not an option,” Andrew Meehan, assistant commissioner for public affairs at Customs and Border Protection, said in a statement on Saturday. “The legal framework must be addressed,” he said, repeating the administration’s calls for Congress to address asylum laws. “The only remedy to this crisis is congressional action.”",1
1789,"“The effort has resulted in the government reopening. That was the critical first step,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska. “But now the real work begins.”
At a nearly giddy news conference just off the Senate floor on Monday, Democrats and Republicans gushed over the possibilities and spoke of meetings to come. “Susan’s office is Switzerland,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said. “It is the one place we can all go and feel good.”
Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, was just as effusive: “We can make a lasting difference in how the Senate of the United States works,” he said before snapping a picture of the group on his iPhone. “We can get it back to working.”
The group’s maneuvering offered members of both parties an escape hatch from a bitter dispute that Republicans and Democrats said could have easily stretched on days longer.
The coalition, which was first formed amid an earlier government shutdown, in the fall of 2013, began to stir to life on Friday afternoon, as it became clear the Senate would be unable to stave off a shutdown. Ms. Collins approached Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat and the coalition’s co-chairman, on the Senate floor, and within hours a group of 17 senators were crowded into her office to sketch out terms of engagement.
The group eventually came to include a broad swath of institutionally minded senators, including the Republicans Jeff Flake of Arizona, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Mike Rounds of South Dakota, and the Democrats Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Doug Jones of Alabama. Members of the group spent the weekend shuttling between Ms. Collins’s overcrowded office, where they snacked on Girl Scout cookies and popcorn, and the office suites of Mr. McConnell and Senator Chuck Schumer, the party leaders. As the weekend wore on, the group kept growing, up to 25 by Monday — crowded enough that one senator had to sit on a credenza.
They cycled through a series of ideas: Further shortening the length of the short-term spending bill; attaching a bill to protect Dreamers to another piece of must-pass legislation; demanding that Mr. McConnell put an immigration bill authored by Mr. Graham and Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, on the floor for a vote. Each was eventually deemed untenable.
By Sunday afternoon, the group had settled on a compromise that would fund the government for three weeks alongside a commitment by Mr. McConnell that the Senate would move expeditiously to take up the immigration issue. The challenge was getting the leaders to agree. Mr. McConnell signaled Sunday night that he was listening to their suggestion, saying on the Senate floor that it was “my intention” to move ahead with immigration legislation.
But Democrats, led by Mr. Schumer, wanted more. The issue was whether the majority leader could be trusted to keep his word. Democrats have not forgiven Mr. McConnell for blocking the Supreme Court nomination of Merrick B. Garland for almost a year in hopes that a Republican would be elected to the White House.
Asked Monday morning how much of an issue that mistrust was, Mr. Manchin was clear. “Uh, most of it,” he said.
Mr. Schumer asked Ms. Collins to meet him in his office late Sunday after Mr. McConnell’s remarks and said he needed more clarity and assurance from the majority leader. Mr. Flake, who had initially supported the shutdown along with most Democrats, worked into the night with Ms. Collins to edge Mr. McConnell toward a more explicit statement.
Monday morning, he firmed up his pledge enough to win over Democrats, saying that the Senate’s immigration debate would have “a level playing field at the outset and an amendment process that is fair to all sides.” Behind the scenes, Republicans in the bipartisan group who had tied their interests to Democrats vouched for Mr. McConnell’s word. “I said before, ‘Trust but verify,’” Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said of Mr. McConnell. “He made this commitment publicly in the Senate floor. He was much more specific than he was last night. And frankly I think this is an important opportunity for him to demonstrate that he will carry through.”
By the time Democratic and Republican senators met privately with their respective caucuses later Monday morning, it was clear it was enough to get to yes. Mr. Schumer told Democrats he would support reopening the government.
Not all Democrats were convinced. Senator Kamala D. Harris, Democrat of California and one of more than a dozen liberal Democrats who voted against the funding bill, said Mr. McConnell’s comments on Sunday night “fell far short of the ironclad guarantee” she needed.
But Mr. Flake said the Republican leader had made clear to Democrats he had done what he could do.
“Standing on the floor and saying we are going to proceed to an immigration bill in this environment with this kind of attention being paid to it is a pretty good promise,” he said.",1
120,"Mexican drug cartels and human traffickers are cashing in ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration by exploiting anxiety over his vow to build a border wall and crack down on illegal immigration – fueling the latest surge across the U.S.-Mexico line, according to local law enforcement.
The president-elect reiterated his pledge at a press conference Wednesday to build a ""wall"" – which he claims will curb illegal immigration, reduce gun violence and stop drugs from being smuggled into the country.
For now, however, the Obama administration's leniency, combined with concerns about Trump's crackdown, is seen as contributing to a spike in crossings from California to Texas.
“There’s definitely a percentage of folks who believed that they can beat the clock,” said Jose Villareal, chief of operations for the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector.
On a recent ride-along in south Texas, Cameron County Sheriff's Office Lt. Robert Rodriguez told OutletNameNews.com he has noted an increase in the flow of border crossers since Trump’s White House win.
“I can feel the anxiety,” Rodriguez said. “You can cut it with a knife.”
He said: “We see more and more people cross every day. ... The cartels are taking advantage of people being scared.”
Rodriguez patrols a patch of road that includes the most southern tip of Texas. He’s seen battered bodies float lifeless down the Rio Grande River and is no stranger to the sight of corpses – from babies to men in their 80s – littered along the land. Some were shot by drug lords, human traffickers and cartel members, while others were abandoned by their “coyotes” – paid guides to get them across the border.
He says moving people across the border is a high-stakes shell game that authorities at the local, state and federal level are losing.
Rodriguez, who says he's been in two shootouts, has seen people come over on foot and packed in passenger vehicles as well as ferried over the Rio Grande in rafts.
“This is ground zero of the problem,” Rodriguez said of the route known as Farm to Market Road 1419 in Cameron County. As for the human carnage he has witnessed, he said, “You’re a commodity. You’re a thing.”
And the traffickers who see border crossers this way are looking at boom times -- at least for now.
In November, U.S. Border Patrol apprehended 47,214 migrants along the southwest U.S. border – an increase of 44 percent compared with a year earlier. November was the Border Patrol’s busiest month since June 2014. In the past six months, agents have caught nearly a quarter-million migrants -- about 1,300 a day -- trying to cross illegally.
“Smugglers are telling them that they need to come across now while there’s a chance,” Art Del Cueto, a Border Patrol agent in Tucson, Ariz., recently told OutletName.
In response, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection dispatched 150 more agents to police the southwestern border. They also opened two temporary facilities to detain thousands of people trying to come over illegally.
""CBP is prepared to add housing, beds, toilets and bathing facilities as necessary,"" it said in a statement. ""CBP is addressing this migratory surge along the southwest border in a humane way, consistent with our border security mission and our American values.""
The border itself remains a challenge.
Of the 315 miles of border in the Rio Grande Valley, only 54 miles have a border fence. The sector, made up of 34,000 square miles of U.S. territory, accounts for more than half of the migrant apprehensions each year.
As the son of Mexican migrant workers who crossed the border illegally decades ago – they later became naturalized citizens – Rodriguez believes talk of the border wall is Washington window-dressing for a more complicated problem.
“Smugglers change their tactic all the time,” he said, adding that with a wall, people can go “underneath it, over it or around it.”
Most of the wall in Cameron County is 18 feet tall and made from rusty iron bars. In other parts, it’s fence. At a cost of more than $6 million per mile to build, the barrier runs through people’s backyards and farmers’ fields. There are gigantic gaps along the way -- stretches where the wall abruptly stops.
“There are actually openings in the wall,” Brownsville Mayor Tony Martinez told OutletNameNews.com. “I haven’t seen people go around the wall or over the wall. I’ve seen them go right through those openings.”
For some residents in the region, the rush of border crossers ahead of Trump taking office has bred fear.
One McAllen-area resident, who asked not to be named out of safety concerns for her young children, said she has seen a “big jump” in numbers.
“The area is enormous and there aren’t enough [authorities] out here,” she said. “We see people cross all the time. Could we say something? Should we? Of course, but what about our kids?”
Rodriguez says intimidation by cartel members is common and that scouts for coyotes and gangs are everywhere.
“One day, a resident complains and the next, there’s a blacked-out SUV in front of their house,” he said. “They get the message.”",0
1719,"During the tenures of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, some of the most influential dealmakers in the Senate — Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona, among them — tried repeatedly to forge a compromise that would increase border security and provide a path to legalization for millions of undocumented immigrants.
But public sentiment had shifted among Republicans and their constituents despite the support for an immigration overhaul from the top of the party. The deals either collapsed in the Senate or were never even brought up in the House, where sentiment against anything that could be branded as “amnesty” runs deep.
“It just all blew up and fell apart,” said Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia and a participant in bipartisan immigration talks in 2005 who remembered getting bricks for a border wall sent to his office in protest of his effort to forge a deal.
Stymied legislatively, Mr. Obama in 2012 instituted DACA via executive order. Mr. Trump promised to reverse it if elected and he did so, providing a window until March 5 to find a permanent solution. That is what led to the shutdown crisis, with Democrats trying to use their leverage over spending to get an acceptable resolution.
Democrats say that twice in recent weeks and another time last year, Mr. Trump appeared to consent to at least the outlines of an agreement that would provide permanent protection for those immigrants. But then he quickly reversed course upon consultation with the hard-line advisers on immigration who have the president’s ear once Democrats depart.
Mr. Schumer said that in a White House luncheon meeting Friday, he offered significant concessions for the DACA legislation, including a large increase in Pentagon spending as well as an agreement to meet the president’s demand for money for the border wall with Mexico that Democrats had previously refused. Democrats say the White House rejected the proposal hours later, asserting that it did not go far enough to limit the ability of new immigrants to bring in more relatives to live in the United States. The president’s shifting positions have left Democrats exasperated.
“I essentially agreed to give the president something he has said he wants in exchange for something we both want,” Mr. Schumer said on Sunday.
Republicans say that this situation is different from ones that led to previous immigration failures, and that they are fully committed to negotiating in good faith when the shutdown is ended.
“Now we have a deadline and we have bipartisan willingness to deal with the issue,” said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican. “I think it’s different.” Both Republicans and Democrats say Mr. Trump’s endorsement of any immigration deal is essential, since it is the only way a sufficient number of House Republicans could be enticed to vote for it under cover of Mr. Trump’s backing.
“That makes it easier for House action,” said Senator Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has been part of the latest round of bipartisan immigration talks. “I think if he finds a way to like it, they can pass it in the House.”
But Mr. Trump’s backing is no guarantee of Republican votes. And even if he does endorse a plan, Republicans worry that he could change his mind at any time.
Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who has been a major impediment to an immigration compromise with Democrats, said Sunday on OutletName’s “Meet the Press” that he could not commit to back a proposal simply because the president endorsed it. And some on Capitol Hill believe that Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s leadership post would be in jeopardy if he pushed through an immigration bill that most House Republicans opposed.
In recent months, Republicans suggested that they would hold a strong hand in any funding showdown because Democrats would be reluctant to force a government shutdown over undocumented immigrants. If Democrats did, Republicans figured they would have a strong message to counter with by attacking Democrats as willing to shortchange Americans to help those who entered the country illegally.
They are now aggressively pressing that line of assault. But the message is also provoking new doubts about the sincerity of Republican determination to help Dreamers, muddying an immigration debate that is at the center of the conflict and has confounded Washington for almost 20 years.",1
2028,"""Like millions of Americans on Thursday night, I was shocked to see anchors on the major news networks quoting President Trump verbatim, in reporting his profane description of Haiti, El Salvador, and nations on the African continent. In an Oval Office meeting on—what else?—immigration, the Chief Executive was heard to whine, ""Why do we need more Haitians?"", and suggested more Norwegians should emigrate to the United States, instead. (Our Nordic friends demurred. Apparently, they’re just fine living in a place with the highest GDP per capita in the world. To them, the United States is a “shithole” by comparison.) Trump’s scabrous remarks were confirmed by Sen. Dick Durbin, who was among a dozen lawmakers present at the meeting. Let this sink in a moment: A sitting President of the United States, without preamble, essentially said, “why are we letting in all these Black and brown people? I want white immigrants!”
You’d be forgiven for thinking Trump had reverted to his old ways as a real-estate developer in 1970s New York City, when he and his father refused to rent apartments to Black applicants, something the Justice Department of the era sued the Trumps over, and won. It’s as if Trump believed America was his own personal, private, property. Oh, wait… Meanwhile, reactions from the denizens of one of those alleged “shithole countries” Trump denounced, are illuminating. Bergson Leneus, who is the first Haitian-American elected to public office in the city of East Orange, NJ, put it very succinctly to me. “[I am] disgusted, uncomfortable, angry, sad, and a whole slew of negative adjectives that I will choose to keep to myself,” he said. “The fact that our President would utter such a vile comment to describe the beautiful country of Haiti and the holy continent of Africa underscores a deep and disturbing pattern of racism, bigotry, and prejudice,” the councilman observed. “The President has no class or sense of diplomacy - characteristics that are required of the highest office in all of the land.” Leneus called on Trump to issue a public apology, but, of course, Trump, as is his usual practice, Tweeted his denial, and congratulated himself for keeping a “tough” stance in immigration.
Like all Americans, whose lineage can eventually be traced back to an immigrant ancestor (with, of course, the exception of Native Americans), the Haitian community takes pride in its heritage on both sides of the ocean. The annual Creole Image Honors ceremony recognizes outstanding achievements among Haitian-Americans. They also know racism when it rears its ugly head. “Statements like the one made by the President are exactly why Creole Image was birthed,” they tell me. “We are looking to educate Haitians and others about the many and ongoing contributions Haitians have made to the world. Racism against Haitians is borne of ignorance and an acceptance of myths as truth— something that is particularly damaging coming from the leader of the free world.” Yes, this is really happening. The Leader Of The Free World™ is damning, in the most unsavory terms, the time-honored tradition of the United States living out the beautiful words of Emma Lazarus’ ""Colossus"" etched on Lady Liberty’s base in New York Harbor. Daring to call Trump out on his behavior, moreover, makes one an enemy of the people.
That was another stink bomb our Orange Troll lobbed out of the White House—again—this week. In the wake of Michael Wolff's West Wing tell-all indictment of life in the Trump administration, the President vowed once again to weaponize a federal libel law, to silence critics like Wolff (or me). Having repeatedly painted journalists as threats to the Republic, purveyors of “fake news” that fails to extol Trump’s greatness—a man of his stable genius, mind you!—the President now seeks to abrogate the First Amendment. Silencing the free press is always a necessary first step on the path toward authoritarianism. A good friend of mine admonished me just yesterday, that writers like myself, who scrutinize the madness emanating from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, could already be on “watch lists” ordered by Trump. That’s not so far-fetched. Forty-five years ago, President Nixon composed his infamous ""enemies list"", and used the government’s agencies—most notably the IRS—to cow them into submission. Trump, by contrast, already makes Tricky Dick look like a rank amateur, when it comes to skulduggery and manipulation of the truth.
While everyone’s heads were ping-ponging back and forth trying to keep up with Trump’s machinations over immigration and attacking the media, the President even managed to fold, spindle, and mutilate the facts once more. In the face of blistering protests by Londoners over an upcoming embassy visit, Trump canceled the trip--blaming President Obama, of course. Obama? Well follow Trump’s twisted logic on this one. The original US Embassy building, located in Grosvenor Square, had become vulnerable to possible terrorist attacks, and it was determined that a new, safer structure, in a more secure location, was needed. The Bush administration (remember him?) concurred, and signed off on a plan to relocate the Embassy to its present Battersea site. This decision was taken in 2008, before Obama took office. Obama, as President, sold the old embassy in 2009, and the proceeds from it, and the sale of other US government properties in the city, covered the $1.2 billion cost of constructing the new one. Obama made the sale, but it was Bush’s operation. Such facts don’t matter to Trump, however, because he can’t ever resist an opportunity to smear or defame (!) people of color, especially his predecessor. It’s not “fake news” when the President does it. (Thanks, Tricky Dicky!)
That was this wild week in Trumpland. In just five days, Trump managed to stir up more international tensions, reaffirm his blatant racism, smear the media (again), and blame his canceled trip on the Black man who occupied the chair before him. Only in America. Sigh.""",1
1199,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday opened the door to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children, the first time he's explicitly said he'd accept a pathway to citizenship for them.
""We're going to morph into it. It's going to happen at some point in the future,"" Trump said of the immigrants eligible for some version of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which Trump has ended but is urging Congress to replace. He said the time frame would be over 10 to 12 years. The President made his comments to a group of reporters who were meeting with White House chief of staff John Kelly at the White House.
Trump called it an ""incentive"" for the immigrants, who largely have known no other country beside America, to work hard and do a ""great job.""
""If they do a great job, I think it's a nice thing to have the incentive of, after a period of years, being able to become a citizen,"" Trump said.
In the meantime, he said DACA recipients should not be worried about being deported if their status expires.
""Tell them not to be concerned, OK?"" Trump said. ""Tell them not to worry about it. We're going to solve the problem. Now, it's up to the Democrats, but they should not be concerned.""
Whether to include a pathway to citizenship -- as opposed to stopping at legal residency -- for DACA recipients has been a key sticking point between hardline conservatives and moderate Republicans and Democrats, on the other.
Trump's extended comments on what he wants in an immigration deal were some of the most substantive to date, after lawmakers have asked the White House and President for months for a clear outline of what he could -- and couldn't -- support.
""I like him! I like Schumer! I grew up with Schumer,"" Trump told reporters.
Reactions to Trump's DACA comments
Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who's been a key part of congressional immigration negotiations, immediately praised Trump's comments after they were made public.
""This statement represents presidential leadership on immigration that will allow us to solve a difficult problem,"" Graham said in a statement. ""I truly appreciate President Trump making it clear that he supports a path to citizenship for DACA recipients. This will greatly help the Senate efforts to craft a proposal which President Trump can sign into law.""
Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, also appeared to praise his remarks in tweeting, ""The President is headed in the right direction here"" with a link to a story on Trump's comments.
Trump also once again equivocated on whether he might extend the deadline for DACA permits to begin expiring if Congress can't get ready in time — a possibility that if left open could complicate the sense of urgency in Congress to reach a deal.
""Yeah, I might do that,"" Trump said of moving the deadline, which is March 5. ""I'm not guaranteeing it because I want to put a little bit of -- but I certainly have the right to do it.""
The President's openness to a pathway to citizenship and clear articulation that the wall, family-based migration and diversity lottery were all he wanted in this deal could help Republicans pare down what conservatives have been pushing for.
""After DACA is done, we will look at the overall immigration,"" Trump said. ""In the initial (deal), we're putting chain, a negotiated chain, we're putting a replacement for lottery or an end to lottery ... and we are going to build a wall, so those three primary things.""
The wall
During the meeting with reporters, Trump also explained what he's looking for on his long-promised border wall, saying that ""if you don't have a wall, you don't have DACA.""
The President said he wanted $25 billion for the wall and $5 billion for ""other security measures,"" all put in a trust fund. He also reiterated that the wall would be roughly 800 miles of new construction plus other replacement fencing and wall, and that it would not have to go anywhere natural barriers existed, like mountains and rivers.
""I'm going to build it way under budget, but we're putting down $25 billion for the wall,"" Trump said. ""But we will build it way under.""
Family immigration and diversity lottery
The President also offered some clarity on what he's looking for on his asks to curtail ""chain migration,"" or family-based visa categories, and the diversity visa lottery — though he left some wiggle room for negotiation.
On chain migration, the President seemed to saw the only visa categories would be for spouses and minor children, but called parents a ""tricky situation.""
""You'll have wives and husbands and you'll have sons and daughters, and you'll talk about parents, the parents is a tricky situation because they came here illegally,"" Trump said.
He repeated his complaints about the diversity lottery — incorrectly suggesting that countries select nefarious characters for the randomly-selected immigrants that still go through vetting — but said it could be replaced or ended.
""It could be a replacement, we bring people in from various countries that come in based on merit and various other reasons,"" Trump said. ""I think even the Democrats know the lottery system is not good. It's a bad system. By the way, great system for other countries, bad system for us.""
The President's endorsement of a deal is seen as critical for passing it in Congress — especially in the House, where the Republican base has been pushing House Speaker Paul Ryan to secure the most conservative deal possible regardless of what can pass the Senate, where Democratic votes are required to clear a 60 vote threshold to advance legislation.
As Trump was leaving the impromptu gathering with reporters, he turned to Kelly and asked for a deal in a few days, prompting laughter from the room.
""Hey, chief, will you do me a favor? When we come back (from Davos), I want you to have a deal, OK? See if we can have a deal,"" Trump told his chief of staff.",1
1721,"The debate around a border wall and immigration has become so distorted by President Trump’s superheated nonsense — we must build a wall to keep out all these rapists and murderers, and Mexico will pay for it — that we’ve forgotten what it would sound like if we actually had a president framing the real border issue in a really honest way to come up with a real solution — not just one to energize his base.
Unfortunately, we have a president who wants to spend $5.7 billion on a wall to fix his political problems with Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham. When what we need is a president who wants to spend $5.7 on a multipronged strategy that will address the actual immigration challenge we face.
Here is how a real president would explain it:
My fellow Americans, we face a global crisis: More people are on the move today seeking jobs, asylum from murderous governments, safety from environmental disasters or just looking for order than at any time since World War II — some 70 million people.
Why now? Answer: During the late 19th and the 20th centuries the world shifted from being governed by large empires in many regions to being governed by independent nation-states. And the 50 years after World II were a great time to be a weak little nation-state — for several reasons.",1
2080,"Democrats provided votes to fund the government on Monday in exchange for an assurance from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that he would put an immigration bill on the floor in the coming weeks.
Liberal groups, which are deeply skeptical whether Republicans will keep their word after years of inaction on codifying protections for the undocumented young people often called Dreamers, angrily slammed Democrats ― and in particular Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) ― for giving away leverage with no firm promise that an immigration bill would reach President Donald Trump’s desk.
“It’s official: Chuck Schumer is the worst negotiator in Washington ― even worse than Trump. Any plan to protect Dreamers that relies on the word of serial liars like Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan or Donald Trump is doomed to fail,” CREDO Political Director Murshed Zaheed said in a statement.
CREDO Action, the activist arm of the wireless phone company, advocates for progressive causes, including immigrants rights and the passage of legislation that would give Dreamers a pathway to citizenship.
MoveOn.org, one of the most influential progressive organizations in Washington, similarly panned the agreement that 33 Senate Democrats voted to advance to a final vote on Monday.
“This is a bad, outrageous deal. Trump and Republicans in Congress stood with their anti-immigrant nativist base, and too many Democrats backed down, abandoned Dreamers, and failed to fight for their values,” MoveOn.org Political Action Executive Director Ilya Sheyman said in a statement.
McConnell said over the weekend that he intends to move to vote on an immigration bill if both parties can’t agree to one by Feb. 8, as long as the government is still fully open. The admission left some Senate Democrats encouraged by the prospect of a bipartisan solution ― even if they have no guarantee from House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) that it will pass in the House.
“I believe Sen. McConnell will follow through,” independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, told reporters on Monday. “I think he’s made his commitments so publicly and so unequivocally.”
Other Democrats, such as Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), remained unconvinced that McConnell and the House Republicans would follow through on immigration.
“I don’t believe he made any commitment whatsoever and I think it would be foolhardy to believe that he made a commitment,” Harris said.
While Senate Democrats did not receive everything they asked for in exchange for voting to reopen the government, they did manage to get the Children’s Health Insurance Program funded for six years. And if McConnell doesn’t follow through on immigration, Democrats will still be able to use his promise to vote against the next spending bill on Feb. 8 and pin the blame on Republicans.
For now, though, Democrats who voted to reopen the government said that simply pushing the conversation in the right direction was a victory on its own.",1
554,"Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer suggested that he offered a concession on the border wall to President Donald Trump during their midday White House meeting before Democrats shut down the government’s 2018 budget at midnight.
“In exchange for strong DACA protections, I reluctantly put the border wall on the table for discussion,’ Schumer said on the Senate floor as he tried to blame Trump for the Democrats’ near-unanimous move to block a procedural vote, so preventing the GOP from passing the government budget with 51 votes.
Schumer did not provide any details on his wall offer. For example, Schumer did not say if he promised the Democratic Party’s endorsement for Trump’s $33 billion, 10-year plan for construction and operation of a wall, or if he was just willing to declare his personal support for a few billion dollars for future construction of a wall.
Many Democrats strongly oppose a border wall as a supposed “trophy” for Trump — but also because it is a symbolic distinction between the United States and other countries. Democratic groups and business groups also oppose the wall because it would hinder the northward flow of cheap-labor migrants to Democratic-run low-wage cities on the coasts.
Trump rejected his wall offer, said Schumer. “When President Trump is ready … Democrats will be ready,” he added.
In 2006, Congress voted for the construction of a 700-mile wall but later refused to provide the funding. That lack of funding has ensured the 2,000-mile border is shielded by only a short stretch of double-layer fencing.
The Democrats’ “Gang of Six” group, led by Schumer’s deputy, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, has offered an amnesty plan to Trump, which Trump rejected. The plan offered $1.5 billion in exchange for an amnesty. But the amnesty would be far bigger and more expensive than the 1986 amnesty, which was said to be for 3 million illegals.
The Gang of Six’s amnesty would cover at least 5 million foreigners, including at least 3 million young illegals, their parents, and 400,000 additional migrants, pus a large but unclear number of their chain-migration relatives. Few of the migrants would have university degrees, and so most would get more in taxpayers’ aid than they would pay in taxes.
Schumer tried to blame the shutdown on Trump and he pushed the claim that Trump does not know what he wants on immigration policy. He said:
Republican leadership can’t get to yes because President Trump refuses to. Mr. President, President Trump, if you are listening, I am urging you: please take yes for an answer.
House Democratic Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi also tried to blame Trump for the Democrats’ shutdown.",0

Now it’s not just one or two, mind you. About 30 of our favorite wall-hating Democrats took off for Puerto Rico in a chartered-jet last weekend!
With families and lobbyists in tow, they even planned to take in a special performance of the Broadway hit, ""Hamilton!""
Wow, sounds like they are really taking this shutdown seriously! Though I can understand why they don’t seem to care, they are still getting paid and have plenty of cash left over to stay in a seaside resort where a room cost over $400 a night.
I wonder if the over 800,000 government workers -- who have not been paid due to the partial shutdown -- can afford such a luxury vacay! Kinda doubt it.
Yet, the excuse will likely be this is Trump’s shutdown, his fault- so why not party it up in Puerto Rico with the lobbyists, right?
Well, while they are having some sunny fun, President Trump sits in snowy D.C. ready to make a deal. In fact, he’s been working for weeks.
And guess what… though he’s ready to make a deal..he’s not caving on the border wall! So I suggest these Democrats take a break from their undeserved break and get back to reality -- the reality that we need to finish the wall!
Now I hope he doesn’t have to declare a State of Emergency. I hope it doesn’t come to that BUT with over 10 million illegal immigrants living in this country and thousands more on the way- it is an emergency.
President Trump brought something up in his Oval Office Address that I wish more Americans would understand, illegal immigration impacts us all BUT it impacts minority and inner-city communities the MOST!
Here's some of what he said, ""But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African Americans and Hispanic Americans.""
Where do you think these illegal immigrants and their children are going to end up? I can tell you this much, it’s not going to be in Nancy Pelosi’s backyard in swanky Pacific Heights. It’s not going to be in the Hollywood Hills, or Malibu or anywhere like that.
They’re going to end up in already underserved communities and in already overcrowded classrooms, bus stations and housing developments.
As a country, we have a right to regulate how many immigrants come in and from where. Illegal immigrants ignoring our laws rob us all of that right.
Mr. President, hold firm. Even the anti-wall Americans will one day see why you did it and they’ll thank you for it.
Those are my First Thoughts. From LA, God bless and take care.

1819,"The U.S. government will no longer automatically extend residency to Cuban migrants arriving in the country without visas, President Barack Obama announced in a surprise decision Thursday.
The “wet foot, dry foot” policy was “designed for a different era,” the president said in a statement.
“By taking this step, we are treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries,” he said. “The Cuban government has agreed to accept the return of Cuban nationals who have been ordered removed, just as it has been accepting the return of migrants interdicted at sea.”
The major policy change came with only days left in Obama’s presidency and after the president had worked for years to normalize diplomatic relations and chip away at the decades-old trade embargo. Obama capped his efforts with a visit to Havana last year. The warming of relations with the onetime Cold War enemy became one of his signature foreign policy achievements.
But the cooling of tensions between the two countries also prompted a surge of immigration from the island, as Cuban nationals sought to take advantage of the unique “wet foot, dry foot” policy of allowing those Cubans who reached American soil to immediately apply for U.S. residency, with a quick pathway to citizenship
The new policy, which was first reported by the Associated Press, ends the extension of U.S. residency to Cubans who arrive without a U.S. visa. It also halts a George W. Bush-era program to recruit the island’s medical professionals, according to a congressional source who declined to be named ahead of the official announcement.
The “wet foot, dry foot” policy was long despised by Cuban officials, who said the policy encouraged people to take their lives into their hands by crossing the Florida straits illegally in anything that would float.
“This has been a big bone of contention for the Cubans throughout this whole process,” Chris Sabatini, a Cuba expert and the executive director of Global Americans, told OutletName.
But in recent years, it’s also become unpopular among older generations of Cuban Americans in Miami, who contend that the policy benefits people who migrate for economic reasons rather than the people fleeing Cuba’s communist government, whom the policy was originally intended to benefit.
Ric Herrero, the executive director of #CubaNow, a group that has pressed to liberalize policy toward the island, said the changes would take a “highly contentious issue off [President-elect Donald] Trump’s plate before he enters the White House.”
“This is another concrete example that a policy of engagement yields results,” Herrero told OutletName. “Our migratory policy toward Cuba has been one that’s problematic for many years but no one has been willing to touch it since Clinton’s first term.”
Roughly 28,400 Cuban nationals with criminal convictions have for years faced the possibility of deportation from the United States, but the Cuban government has refused to accept them.
Some 56,400 Cuban migrants entered the United States without visas last year, according to Customs and Border Protection ― nearly twice the number in 2014. White House Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told reporters that they did not want to speculate publicly about the policy change and risk encouraging more people to come to the U.S. without authorization.
The 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, from which the Wet Foot/Dry Foot policy originally derives, remains standing, though Obama administration officials urged Congress to repeal it. Cubans who reach U.S. soil will still be allowed to request asylum or other humanitarian relief under U.S. law, but immigration authorities will now treat those claims like those of other foreign nationals.
To carry out the new policy, the Cuban government agreed to accept back its nationals in cases where the U.S. starts the deportation policy sooner than four years after that person left the island, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on a call with reporters. That leaves the vast majority of the longstanding cases pending, though Johnson said the Cuban government agreed to review the decisions on a case-by-case basis.
“Essentially what the agreement means is that past is past but that the future will be different,” Johnson said.
In Congress, supporters of engagement with Cuba applauded the move.
“It’s a move that brings our Cuba policy into the modern era while allowing the United States to continue its generous approach to those individuals and refugees with a legitimate claim for asylum,” Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said.
But the fact that the Obama administration is making a major policy change with only a week to go in his presidency concerned some congressional sources.
“There is absolutely a need to crack down on the small universe of people abusing the policy, but throwing the baby out with the bathwater AND on the 9th inning AND without Congressional consultation?” a congressional aide said in an email. “Hard to defend.”
There was dissent from Congress as well. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.), a longtime critic of Obama on Cuba policy, called the decision “yet another shameful concession to the Castro regime.”
“His policy has been a succession of betrayals of America’s longstanding commitment to human rights and freedom, and a betrayal of the Cuban people who have suffered under oppression for far too long,” Diaz-Balart said in a statement. “This last act of diminishing lifelines to Cubans languishing in totalitarianism is one final despicable betrayal of a people who deserve better from an American president.”
The policy change also could put President-elect Donald Trump in an uncomfortable position of agreeing with a last-minute move by the current president he often disparages. The president-elect’s team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Obama’s decision, but Trump has previously criticized the “wet foot, dry foot” policy. “I don’t think that’s fair,” Trump said in February 2016. “I mean why would that be a fair thing?”",1
1722,"Located on El Centro’s Main Street, D’Poly and its clientele embody the biculturalism of border towns across the Southwest. Farm workers, white-collar professionals, big families and off-duty Border Patrol agents congregate here for tacos, sopes and flavored juices. Modern and minimalist, the restaurant’s gray walls and dark wood floors could be the backdrop of an elegant Crate and Barrel photo shoot — save for an arresting pink mural of Frida Kahlo that instantly sets the room apart. Flashes of pastel pop from behind a tiled bar, which includes a display of “Dia de los Muertos” statuettes.
English and Spanish are heard virtually interchangeably at table after table. Latin pop plays in the background, songs like “Dónde Estarás” by the Mexican electrocumbia musician Raymix.
Mr. Galeana, who owns the restaurant along with his wife, Teresa, said he and his family decorated with the idea of showcasing Mexican culture in a modern setting, a concept that “so often is lost” in Mexican restaurants in favor of stereotypical décor like sombreros.
“Our idea was to show that Mexico is not just what the stereotypes say: It’s so much more,” he said. “We are proud of our culture, and we want to show that.”
That is what many of those here say they wish the president understood: Immigration and cross-national exchanges are celebrated in these towns along the border.
Hildy Carrillo, the executive director of the Calexico Chamber of Commerce, has been sharply critical of President Trump’s immigration policies. She watched with exasperation last year when Mr. Trump called the replacement of the town’s border barrier “the start of our Southern Border WALL!” She said she feared the president’s remark would turn Calexico into an anti-immigration symbol and make it seem unsafe.",1
1701,"The State of the Union takes place in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives but, ultimately, President Trump has the home court advantage in what amounts to a one-way conversation with the American people.
In two previous speeches from the House dais — his 2017 address to the Joint Session of Congress and last year’s State of the Union — Mr. Trump has used a softer tone than that in his biting Twitter feed. But in the lofty standards of a State of the Union speech, language and facts matter as much as the optics and tenor.
Here’s what Mr. Trump has said so far and how it stacks up against the facts.
President Trump said an illegal immigrant murdered the family members of three of his guests this evening.
This is not yet determined.
Under the American justice system, defendants are innocent until proven guilty. Wilbur Martinez-Guzman, a citizen of Guatemala who American officials believe has been living in the country illegally, has been charged with the murders of Gerald David, 81 and his wife, Sharon David, 80. But he has neither confessed to them nor been convicted of the crimes.
President Trump said large, organized caravans of Central Americans are on the march to the United States.
This is exaggerated.
At the end of January, a new caravan of thousands of migrants from Central America was headed north, and some of the travelers said they intended to try to cross into the United States. But many in the caravan have said they plan to remain in Mexico, thanks in part to policies put in place by the new Mexican government. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has made it easier for Central Americans to get visas and work in Mexico. President Trump’s warnings of an imminent invasion from new caravans is overstated.",1
1969,"Last Thursday at the Paramount Theater in Oakland, California, immigrants from 88 countries stood and raised their right hand and recited an oath of allegiance — “I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty…”
At this moment, a news notification from the Washington Post popped up on cellphones: “Trump attacks protections for immigrants from ‘shithole’ countries.”
I was one of the 1,123 immigrants at the Paramount, standing in the auditorium, right hand raised, intently repeating the words through which we were to become Americans.
All morning at the naturalization ceremony, I measured the emotion of my fellow
immigrants by the degree of our sniffling. I was seated in the back rows of the full auditorium. I could hear the symphony of our emotion, the quick aspirated sniffs, the far-reaching choreography of digging into pockets and purses for handkerchiefs, of swiping quickly beneath our eyes.
We sniffle at the small choir singing “This Land Is Your Land.” We sniffled
when we were told in Chinese, Tagalog, English, French, and Spanish that we were welcome. We sniffled at the screening of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, especially at the words, “I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.’”
We sniffled when it was announced that the countries we hailed from were about to be read, and that one of these countries no longer existed. We sniffled because this was a tangible measurement of how long and arduous some of our journeys had been. Then we sniffled at the sound of the nations we represented: Haiti, Mexico, El Salvador, Colombia, India, Yemen, Syria, Iraq.
Being an immigrant is a malleable place, an in-between, a pending state. Through our oath, we were leaving that place. We were becoming something politically tangible.
Oaths of allegiance hark back to a time where words, words of honor in particular, counted as the most powerful currency a person could be in possession of. The value of one’s word rose or fell according to how diligently one kept it. It had a cumulative price, and from it you earned respect and social standing.
Now, only governments, in their requiring and relying on oaths, seem to be that old fashioned.
As an immigrant, the government has required of me countless oaths. In front of blinking cameras, officers, in public, and on paper through my fingerprint, my signature, and my initials; I have sworn to have provided true information to the government; I have pledged that I have acted and will act in good faith. Lying can get your papers revoked.
In the morning just before my oath ceremony I sat at a Starbucks a few blocks from the Paramount, having celebratory caffeine. I had wanted to slow down and reflect. I had wanted to tell my husband how when the opportunity for me to study in the U.S. presented itself, my family was not economically stable, and in Colombia my parents borrowed what we did not have.
For a year, my parents ate only rice and beans, and I wandered around Chicago burdened by the quest for something to accomplish that would equal what they had done for me. I had wanted to tell my American husband that you never satisfy that kind of emotional debt. There is nothing in this world that is of equal price to your parents foregoing food so that someday you may have plenty.
But instead of all of that, I was absorbed by my phone. I was reading about the 200,000 immigrants from El Salvador who had been told, as the 45,000 Haitians in November, that their Temporary Protected Status had been revoked. According to the Center for Migrations Studies, Salvadorans here under TPS have 192,700 American-born children who are U.S. citizens. Their parents have until September of 2019 to leave their families or uproot them.
In the auditorium at the Paramount we recited the oath, and then the allegiance to the flag. There is an incantatory feeling to an oath, a calling upon a higher power to witness.
We had been so nervous that when the speaker turned to exit the stage and spoke a quick “thank you” into the microphone, we repeated back “thank you,” then giggled realizing our mistake, us new Americans.
We were told to sit down. There would be a screening of a prerecorded message from the president. We grew quiet and still. Then a small square flashed in light on stage.
“My dear fellow Americans,” Donald Trump began. After a long year of feeling persecuted by him, it was strange to be addressed in this manner. “It is with great pride that I welcome you to the American family,” he said.
In a flash I recalled the Muslim ban, the infamous statements about Mexican
immigrants — was it really with great pride that he welcomed us to the American family?
In his message to us new Americans, Trump sounded stern and slightly annoyed, like he was talking to children. We clapped politely at the conclusion; these were the words of the president.
Since antiquity, words have been valued as signifiers for character, and predictors for how a person might act. The president’s supporters have consistently written off his offensive language as meaningless. In that the currency of Trump’s word — constantly populated by racist and sexist remarks, lies, half-truths and misguided statements — is worthless, they are correct. But his words are not meaningless. As commander in chief, his words shape policy. They place borders, move peoples, welcome some and remove others.",1
416,"Angel mom Sabine Durden offered to bring her dead son’s ashes to show House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer the consequence of not securing the southern border.
Durden was responding to a proposal Trump 2020 presidential campaign manager Brad Pascale made to Pelosi and Schumer.

“I would volunteer and bring my sons ashes for a simple show and tell because clearly they don’t want to understand anything else,” legal German immigrant Sabine Durden wrote Wednesday.

Durden’s son Dominic Durden came to the U.S. with his family in 1992, at the age of ten. He was a 911 dispatcher for the Riverside Sheriff’s Department and had dreams of becoming a Police helicopter pilot. He received awards posthumously for his extensive community involvement and volunteerism.
An illegal alien driving without a license and with two prior DUI convictions slammed into Dominic Durden and his motorcycle in July 2012, killing the young man. The offender spent just 35 days in jail for killing Dominic.

73,"The other day I watched a group of young lefties protest the Trump administration’s immigration policies. They were carrying Mexican flags and screaming: ""Si, se puede!"" Yes we can.  ""Si, se puede"" is now the rallying cry of the no-borders left, but it wasn’t always. The slogan first became famous fifty years ago, thanks to Cesar Chavez, founder of the United Farm Workers union. When Chavez said ""Si, se puede,"" he meant something very different: ""yes, we can seal the borders."" Cesar Chavez hated immigration. He was Hispanic and left wing, but he called illegal Mexican immigrants ""wetbacks,"" and fought to keep them out of the country. He understood that peasants from Latin America will always work for less than Americans will. That’s why employers prefer them. Immigration undercut his members’ wages and weakened the union. ""As long as we have a poor country bordering California,"" Chavez once explained, ""it’s going to be very difficult to win strikes."" In 1969, Chavez led a march down the center of California to protest the hiring of immigrant produce pickers. Marching alongside him was Senator Walter Mondale, and the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, the longtime aide to Martin Luther King. It didn’t seem strange at the time. Liberals still cared about working class wages.  Years later, Chavez dispatched armed union members into the desert to assault Mexican nationals who were trying to sneak across the border. Chavez’s men beat immigrants with chains and whips made of barbed wire. Illegal aliens who dared to work as scabs had their houses bombed and cars burned. The union paid Mexican officials to keep quiet. Chavez wasn’t embarrassed about any of this. He bragged about it.  In California, Chavez remains a progressive hero. There’s a state holiday named after him, and at least 25 public schools. Chavez’s life is a reminder of how much the left has changed, and how quickly. For a century, many Democrats agreed with Chavez. They opposed mass immigration because they believed it hurt American workers. As a factual matter, they were right. One study, conducted after the 1980 Mariel boatlift in Miami, found that high school educated Americans saw their wages fall by more than a third after large numbers of Cuban refugees arrived. If you believe in supply and demand, this isn’t surprising.  Even liberals understood the principle. After the fall of Saigon in1975, Governor Jerry Brown opposed letting Vietnamese refugees into California, on the grounds that the state already had enough poor people. As Brown put it at the time, ""There is something a little strange about saying, 'Let's bring in 500,000 more people' when we can't take care of the one million Californians out of work."" Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware agreed; he introduced federal legislation to curb the arrival of the Vietnamese. Even George McGovern, maybe the most liberal Democrat in the Senate, opposed bringing more refugees into the country. ""I think the Vietnamese are better off in Vietnam,"" McGovern said.  Two decades later, leading Democrats were still wary of mass immigration. As Bill Clinton put it in his 1995 state of the union address, ""The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by US citizens or immigrants. The public services they use impose burdens on our taxpayers."" No prominent Democrat could say anything like that today without being denounced as racist. Clinton got a standing ovation. As late as 2006, there were still liberals who cared about the economic effects of immigration. ""Immigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants,"" explained economist Paul Krugman in the OutletName. ""We’ll need to reduce the inflow of low-skill immigrants."" That same year, Hillary Clinton voted for a fence on the Mexican border. So did Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, and 23 other Senate Democrats. But that was the last gasp of a dying elite consensus. Twenty years after Bill Clinton told Americans they had the right to be upset about illegal immigration, his wife scolded the country for enforcing border controls. The 2016 Democratic platform demanded that all illegal immigrants living in the United States be, ""incorporated completely into our society through legal processes."" It was now Democratic Party orthodoxy not simply to let illegal aliens stay in the country, but to let them vote.  What changed? Not the economics of immigration. Supply and demand remained in effect. Predictably, as the country admitted more impoverished immigrants, its own middle class shrunk, becoming a minority of the population in 2015. But Democrats stopped caring. Why? Here’s the short answer, in four simple facts: One: There are likely more than 22 million illegal aliens within our borders.  Two: Democrats plan to give them all citizenship. It’s in their platform.  Three: Studies show the overwhelming majority of first-time immigrant voters vote Democrat.  Four: The biggest landslide in American presidential history was only 17 million votes.  Do the math. The payoff for Democrats is obvious: a permanent electoral majority and total control of the country for generations.  That’s the point, no matter what they tell you. From their perspective, it’s well worth destroying the middle class. ",0
425,"Press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters in Wednesday’s briefing that the White House will release an immigration deal bill framework on Monday.
“Last fall the White House sent Congress a list of the core reforms necessary to fix our immigration system,” said Sanders. The list was compiled in considering talks on the issue with frontline law enforcement officers and career public servants.
Sanders pointed to dozens of meetings since that list was sent – meetings to discuss the reforms and find a “bipartisan path forward” with Republican and Democrat leadership and rank and file members of the House and Senate. Those negotiations are the basis of a new legislative framework that the White House has assembled and will release on Monday.
This framework “represents a compromise that members of both parties can support,” said Sanders, adding they will encourage the Senate to bring it to the floor. “This framework will fulfill the four agreed upon pillars: securing the border and closing legal loopholes, ending extended family chain migration, canceling the visa lottery, and providing a permanent solution on DACA.”
President Donald Trump himself has been repeatedly emphatic that any deal on DACA recipients must include an end to the visa lottery, end to chain migration, and funding for border security including his signature campaign promise for a southern border wall.

2086,"Donald Trump stooped to a new low this morning; tweeting classless comments towards MSOutletName’s hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. In response to negative coverage of Trump by the two “Morning Joe” hosts, he tweeted that Mika has a “low IQ” and that Joe is “psycho.”
I heard poorly rated _Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came.. — Donald J. Trump () June 29, 2017
Case study in projection aside, Trump continued by implying that despite the bad treatment the “Morning Joe” co-hosts were giving him, Joe and Mika tried to get their way into spending time with Donald Trump at his resort during New Years ― randomly stating that Mika “was bleeding badly from a face-lift.”
...to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no! — Donald J. Trump () June 29, 2017
Besides expected outrage from the left, the right has come out against these tweets with more widespread condemnation than usual, with several prominent GOP lawmakers denouncing the comments. Conniption fits from the president, unfortunately, are not unusual events. Donald Trump’s antics have been daily news since he announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015 (let that sink in). From that day forward he has been on a warpath, pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable in political discourse to the edge. And taking in the news of just today alone, he has won.
By the way, these tweets come on the same day that the “No Sanctuary For Criminals Act” passed the House and heads to the Senate. According to reporting from E.A. Crunden at ThinkProgress, the bill demands that sanctuary cities comply with federal immigration operations, or face cuts in federal funding for initiatives that would, “reduce rape kit backlogs, combat opioid addiction, fight human trafficking, and hire career law enforcement.”This means that cities that choose to ignore the law will either need to recuperate some or all of those funds to sustain those vital programs, or lose funding altogether for them. The message is clear: if undocumented immigrants aren’t deported, survivors of sexual violence, people addicted to drugs, victims of human trafficking, local law enforcement agencies, local budgets, and the local community will all suffer.
By the way, this bill also comes on the same day that the Supreme Court’s version of the infamous travel ban went into effect, banning travel from 6 majority-Muslim countries with some slightly moderate exceptions. There are serious concerns being raised about whether the ongoing battle for these travel restrictions are an unconstitutional religious ban in disguise.
Bryan Anselm/OutletName
These concerns are not dampened by Trump’s previous statements, saying that he wanted an indefinite ban on Muslims entering the US. Nevertheless, this bill directly targets refugees who are fleeing countries ravaged by terrorist groups like ISIS ― never mind that taking in refugees is so central to the American identity that it is on our most famous statue.
The so-called ""health care reforms"" that the Republican House and Senate tried to pass at an extreme pace would not only undo all of the gains that Obamacare made, but leave 22 million people without health insurance by 2026 rather than leaving Obamacare in place. The people who would lose their health insurance would lose affordable and live-saving access to doctors. Lives would be unnecessarily lost because of this legislation, yet tragically, some of the same people with the most to lose are still in support of the Republican bill. Those who won't be personally affected and still support the bill just don't care that others will die needlessly.
With a travel ban that hurts refugees, tough immigration laws that hurt law-abiding undocumented immigrants (and have the potential to hurt many others), and an outright hostile healthcare plan that will hurt poor and middle class families alike, the theme of 2017 conservatism in the US, led by Trump, is a moratorium on sympathy. The idea of walking a mile in someone else’s shoes seems lost on a large portion of the country, and I’m not alone in thinking this. And that lack of sympathy matched with the level of vitriol openly used by the President of the United States is dangerous. This political climate is already bearing fruit: just look at the National Rifle Association’s newest video, transcribed below:
“They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance. All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia and smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law abiding — until the only option left is for police to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they’ll use it as an excuse for their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth. I’m the National Rifle Association of America and I’m freedom’s safest place.”
The NRA’s ad is sickening. It’s filled with dogwhistles and divisive language, suggesting that news, public education, and entertainment are all against them. It’s a shameless, thinly veiled “us vs them” narrative featuring a call for people to take up arms against the NRA’s political enemies. If the NRA only cared about gun rights, they would look into the case of Philando Castile, a law abiding registered gun owner who was shot almost immediately by a police officer during a routine traffic stop. Their silence on the issue in juxtaposition with their new ad is deafening and telling.
Why do we, as Americans, want to punish undocumented immigrants for fleeing a drug war that the US is at least partially responsible for? (If you disagree with that assertion, you’re disagreeing with Rex Tillerson, Trump’s Secretary of State.) There is already a lengthy process for vetting refugees wishing to enter the US, why must there be a largely arbitrary ban placed on these countries on top of that? Why did largely Republican members of the House and Senate try to push a bill that would leave human beings with no ability to get care for illnesses and live a better quality of life? Why is the NRA trying to channel political outrage into a second civil war?

I’m not saying I have the answers for these questions, nor am I saying that I have the answers for how to deal with these larger political issues. I’m not even saying I have the right opinions, but at the very least I can imagine myself in the shoes of the undocumented immigrant, the uninsured patient, the Muslim refugee, and yes, the middle-American who has felt socially and economically disenfranchised until the last election.",1
681,"President Trump tweeted a video Tuesday evening of then-Senator Barack Obama condemning illegal immigration while adding that the United States cannot let unvetted people enter the country.
I agree with President Obama 100%! — Donald J. Trump () October 23, 2018
In the video, which dates back to 2005, Obama said, “We are a generous and welcoming people here in the United States but those that enter the country illegally and those that employ them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law.”
“We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants in this country,” he added.
The president’s tweet comes as thousands of people are marching from Central America through Mexico with their end goal being the United States.",0
1073,"The State Department has begun requesting ""most"" US visa applicants provide information on their social media accounts, a department official said in a statement.
The move was expected following an announcement in March of last year that outlined plans to require nearly all US visa applicants to submit their social media handles and other information.
The State Department statement over the weekend said the forms for both immigrant and nonimmigrant visa applicants had been updated ""to request additional information, including social media identifiers.""
According to the official's statement, the move is a result of a memorandum issued by President Donald Trump in 2017 on ""vetting"" for people coming to the US and a provision of an executive order from around the same time that sought to block entry to the US for people from several majority-Muslim countries, which included a provision on vetting standards.
OutletName previously reported that the change was expected to affect around 15 million people.",1
1835,"As California officially became a “sanctuary state” at the start of the new year, fake signs with anti-immigrant messages appeared near the state’s borders.
“Official sanctuary state. Felons, Illegals and MS13 Welcome!” the signs read. “Democrats Need The Votes!”
The messages had been papered over existing signs, California Department of Transportation spokesman Mark Dinger told OutletName on Wednesday.
They referred to a new law, signed by Gov. Jerry Brown (D) in October and effective Jan. 1, that limits local law enforcement’s cooperation with federal immigration officials and prohibits police from generally inquiring into people’s immigration status. The California Values Act does not, however, bar police from working with immigration officials in the cases of people convicted of a wide range of felonies.
The signs suggested that undocumented immigrants are dangerous criminals.
OMG! Look at this sign someone put up on the 15 Freeway between LA and Las Vegas!
It reads :
Welcome to California. Official Sanctuary State.
Felons, Illegals and MS13 Welcome
Democrats need the Votes! #NewYearsDay pic.twitter.com/pc5xRnqZIB — Kambree Kawahine Koa () January 1, 2018
Five of the prank signs were reported around the state, but Caltrans employees have found and taken down only two, spokesman Dinger said. One on I-15 near the Nevada border was removed on Monday, and another on I-40 near the Arizona border came down Tuesday. Caltrans was not able to locate at least three other signs reported near the Oregon and Arizona borders.
Caltrans did not know who was behind the signs, Dinger said, and would not be investigating the incident as it is not a law enforcement agency.
Photos of the signs were circulated largely by conservative accounts on Twitter, with former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin tweeting about them and other apparent opponents of the sanctuary law appearing amused by the prank.

1654,"At a migrant shelter near the Mexican border, three girls from Guatemala — sisters aged 10, 9 and 6 — coughed and sniffled. One of them clung to both a teddy bear and a large bottle of Pedialyte, to soothe her dehydration and flu.
The girls’ mother, Nelcy, 28, said her daughters got sick not during their long journey to the border in the back of a pickup truck, but during the 12 days they spent at two crowded government detention facilities before arriving at the privately run shelter in Texas. “It was very cold, especially for the children,” said Nelcy, who would only be identified by her first name. “My children got sick. They gave us aluminum blankets, but it wasn’t enough.”
The shelter network here run by the nonprofit Annunciation House is now receiving roughly 200 new migrants a day, the same number it saw in an entire week only a year ago. The number of migrants traveling as families crossing the border from Mexico exceeded 25,000 in November, the highest numbers ever recorded.
Like Nelcy and her daughters, the new arrivals from Central America are coming in much sicker, after being held far longer than ever before in bare-bones government detention facilities never intended for children. Asylum seekers bottled up in Mexico are jumping fences and throwing rocks at officers, who are firing tear gas to push them away. Hundreds of migrants have been released on city streets in recent weeks, uncertain of where to go. Two sick migrant children have died while in custody.",1
38,"Amidst a border crisis that has morphed into a national security and a humanitarian crisis, leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination have all but endorsed open borders. During the first of the candidate debates, the Democrats expressed broad support for decriminalizing illegal immigration. The candidates also expressed unanimous opposition to removing any illegal immigrant who is not also a violent felon. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has taken the same position. With the possible exception of former Vice President Joe Biden (whose momentary hesitation will no doubt result in another abject apology in the near future), the Democratic presidential hopefuls committed to lavish social benefits for illegal immigrants, including publicly funded health care coverage. The first of many debates may have delighted the Democratic Party’s most animated supporters, but it is alarming many of the party’s more sober ones. In the space of just a few days, left-leaning journalists, constitutional scholars, and even President Obama’s Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson penned opinion pieces warning that the party’s increasingly radical stances on immigration pose – for them – a nightmare scenario: Donald Trump taking the oath of office again on Jan. 20, 2021. One might logically think that the reverse would also be true – that the Republican response to Democrats driving themselves off a cliff would be to help them do just that. The American public – particularly those who live in swing states and congressional districts that will determine not just control of the White House, but also Congress – is alarmed about what is happening at the border. Polls consistently show that immigration now tops the list of voter concerns and that there is strong support for securing the border, ending asylum abuse, and ending catch-and-release policies. Republicans are in control of the Senate, where bills that would do all of those things are teed up and ready to go. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., just needs to schedule a floor debate and a vote – something he has inexplicably refrained from doing. Getting this legislation over the 60-vote hurdle necessary to bring bills to the floor for a final vote is no easy task in the current hyperpartisan climate in Washington. But McConnell and the Republicans are in a no-lose situation. If they can peel away a handful of purple state Democrats, they can claim credit for addressing a top-of-the-mind concern for American voters. In essence, they would force their political rivals to make a difficult choice. Do they side with concerns of the vast majority of Americans, or do they side with radicals? Pelosi rules the House by virtue of some two-dozen members from ""purple"" districts. Many replaced Republican members by very slim margins. Do these freshmen Democrats really want to go into the next election having blocked asylum reform and border security, while having increased and improved detention facilities for families and minors? Do they want to do so with someone at the head of their party's ticket who calls for decriminalizing illegal immigration and giving everyone who shows up government-funded health insurance? The humanitarian crisis at the border is real. The volume of illegal border crossers is overwhelming the system and creating conditions that appall Americans across the political spectrum. Democrats, led by their most radical wing, have offered solutions that have little public support and are setting off alarm bells among thoughtful party stalwarts. By contrast, Republicans have solutions to the immigration crisis that do enjoy broad public support, and congressional leadership that refuses to play its strong hand. The ever-worsening immigration crisis dictates that it is time for congressional Republicans to move decisively on sensible border enforcement and asylum reform. Democrats have opened the door for them if they are willing to act on behalf of the American people and common sense.",0
647,"Donald Trump, our wannabee dictator and demagogue took another dangerous step to dishonor democracy Friday when he said he could declare a national emergency and build his wall by executive fiat. Trump said “I could do it if I wanted.” Hello banana republic! Goodbye democracy! If I was a member of the Federalist Society (which I’m not), I would worry a lot about Trump’s disposition to abuse our constitution tradition of checks and balances.
Trump’s position is reminiscent of French King Louis XIV’s famous dictum “L’Etat, c’est moi”, which freely translates into English as “I’m the king, so it’s my way or the highway or in this case, the wall.” Since Donald Trumpthinks he’s the state, he figures as long as he’s working it doesn’t matter if the United States government is shut down for months or even years.
Well he can declare a national emergency and raid money from the Pentagon for fake national security to build the wall. That’s one way to end the Trump Shutdown. Or he can throw another terrible two tantrum like he did the other day when it became clear to him that he couldn’t get what he wanted when he wanted it.
Or he could act like an adult instead of a spoiled child and try is to reach a compromise agreement with congressional leadership along the lines of comprehensive immigration reform plans proposed by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. These presidential compromise proposals would have increased border security spending by $68 billion (Obama proposal), provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and crack down on businesses for illegal hiring.
There’s no evidence the wall would halt immigration but facts don’t matter to the president. During the 2008 GOP presidential campaign, Governor Rick Perry of Texas criticized Mitt Romney’s border wall proposal by pointing out that anybody with a 11 foot ladder can get over a 10 foot tall fence.
Rather than compromise, Trump would rather demagogue the issue which he tried to do during the midterm election campaign with disastrous results. The national exit poll indicated that twice as many midterm voters picked health care over immigration as the reason for their decision. The health care voters supported Democrats by a three to one margin. The immigration voters went GOP but there weren’t nearly enough of them to help Republicans preserve their majority in the House.
Now that electoral democracy 2018 style failed Trump, he wants to resort to executive fiat which is not exactly what the founders of our great nation intended. I’m a part time college professor and I emphasize the study of the U.S. Constitution when I teach Introduction to American Government and Politics. I’m always thought Donald Trump would benefit greatly if he took POS 101. But I guess he can’t since he bankrupted Trump University before starting his quest to bankrupt the nation morally and financially.
The founders were scared to death of a tin horn dictator rising to power. To ward off the danger of a power hungry demagogue usurping power in the young democracy, they developed a system where that plays one branch of government against another so one person ever gets to do what he or she wants without regard to the other players.
There’s good news and bad news after 239 years of constitutional trial and error. The good news is that a dictator has never ruled over the United States. No dictators like Hitler, Mao or Stalin have risen on our shores. Not yet anyway! Score one for the founders!
The bad news in our democracy is that things change slowly. It would be better if the nation improved quickly but that’s better than losing our democratic and free form of government.
We have a very complicated and messy system of checks and balances that makes it difficult to solve the big problems facing the nation. The downside is that gridlock prevents the United States from attacking climate change, adapting to a post industrial economy or paving the way for a social change. If the president really wants to satisfy his edifice complex and build something, he should get serious about rebuilding our obsolete economic, electronic and educational infrastructure which would be a real memorial to his tattered presidency.
America might change quickly if the president ruled by executive fiat but that kind of change would drive our nation to hell in a hand basket faster than you can say Mussolini. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. often said “the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice. If Donald Trump had his way, the arc would break not bend. Then there would be no justice or democracy at all. Maybe that’s what the he really wants.",0
172,"A proposed law that would punish countries that refuse to take back their illegal immigrant criminals is two years too late to save Casey Chadwick, but the Texas congressman behind it figures it’s the least Washington can do.
Chadwick was murdered in 2015 by Jean Jacques, an illegal immigrant from Haiti and one of thousands freed onto U.S. streets each year after they serve prison time because their homelands refuse deportation. But a proposal by Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, the Criminal Alien Deportation Enforcement Act, would force such countries to take back their citizens or risk losing foreign aid and travel visa privileges.
“The problem is hundreds of Americans are being robbed, assaulted, raped or murdered every year by criminal aliens who are then released back onto the streets because their countries of origins refuse to take them back,” Babin said. “I have personally met with a number of these victims, or if the victim is deceased, I have met with their families. It is heart-wrenching.”
Chadwick’s case is among the most egregious, Babin said. Jacques was sentenced to 60 years in prison last year for stabbing Chadwick, 25, to death in her Norwich apartment. The killer had been in the U.S. illegally since 1992, had already spent 17 years in prison for attempted murder and possession of a firearm without a permit.
He was not deported after serving time, but it was not for lack of U.S. effort. Jacques was listed as a passenger on three charter flights to Haiti in June, August and October of 2012, but each time the Haitian government refused to repatriate him.
A 2001 Supreme Court ruling, Zadvydas v. Davis, held that illegal immigrants ticketed for deportation but unaccepted by their home countries cannot be detained indefinitely. Jacques was held for 205 days, but ultimately freed less than six months before he killed Chadwick.
“For the sake of Casey and thousands of other Americans who have been victimized, it is time we start putting the safety of our citizens first and stop this revolving door that is allowing dangerous criminals who should be deported back onto our streets,” Babin said.
A House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing in April documented that since 2013, 86,288 illegal immigrants have committed 231,074 crimes after being released from prison. Many of those illegal immigrants are ultimately deported, but some 2,166 who had served their time for various crimes were released last year when their home countries refused to take them back.
Babin’s bill would require the Department of Homeland Security report to Congress every three months the names of uncooperative countries. The federal government would then withhold foreign aid to those countries while the State Department would suspend travel visas.
Under President-elect Donald Trump, the bill faces “renewed interest” because Trump “has voiced his strong support for punishing countries that refuse to accept deportations,” Babin said.
The problem is “getting out of hand,” agreed Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies.
There are now more than 20 countries that refuse to cooperate with the U.S., and more than 60 that make the process extremely difficult, Vaughan said.
“It’s not just Cuba and Cambodia anymore; now it’s China, Bangladesh, Nigeria and many others,” she said.
The State Department has imposed visa sanctions only once, on Gambia, just a few months ago, which worked right away, Vaughan said.
“All they had to do was stop issuing visas to Gambian government officials, and they suddenly started cooperating, within weeks, which is fast in the diplomatic context,” Vaughan said.
Under current law, the State Department must impose sanctions upon request of the Department of Homeland Security, but that rarely happens, said Vaughan.
Claude Arnold, a former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations, said in past administrations, DHS would raise this issue to the State Department but nothing would ever happen. He believes under this proposed bill, will be more Congressional oversight.
“The U.S. is the center of international trade. As soon as businesses are not allowed to come to the U.S. to do business internationally, that’s all it would take,” Arnold said. “Those countries would start accepting back their deportees immediately because they would get such pressure from their citizenry who would be hurt financially.”
Neither the State Department nor the Department of Homeland Security comments on pending legislation.
But a State Department official told OutletNameNews.com facilitating the removal of aliens subject to a final order of removal, particularly those who pose a danger to national security or public safety, is a “top priority.”
“Stepped-up diplomatic efforts by [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and the State Department have resulted in significant increases in cooperation among the 23 countries currently on ICE’s Uncooperative list, with nearly half of these countries improving their records of issuing travel documents, accepting charter deportee flights with deportees, and agreeing on formal arrangements for future removals in recent months,” the spokesman said.
A spokesperson for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement said the agency is working through “diplomatic channels” to ensure that other countries accept the timely return of their nationals in accordance with international law.
But Babin said he will fight for tougher restrictions.
“Many of these countries are getting millions and millions of dollars from the American taxpayer, and then not taking their criminals back,” Babin said.

1842,"Even as Democrats and voting rights groups praised the sudden demise of President Donald Trump’s voter fraud commission on Wednesday, voting rights experts were raising alarms about the news that the Department of Homeland Security would step into the breach.
The White House said Wednesday that dissolving the commission didn’t mean the administration was ending its focus on voter fraud. Homeland Security will take up the baton. Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), the vice chair of the now-defunct panel, told Politico that the department can take information collected by the commission and run it against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement database of non-citizens to identify people illegally on state voter rolls.
Voting rights groups had viewed the commission as nothing more than an attempt to gin up evidence to back Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about widespread voter fraud in the 2016 election. On Thursday, election lawyers, civil rights groups and other experts saw serious flaws in the Homeland Security plan, too.
They noted that voter fraud does not fall with Homeland Security’s expertise and that efforts to cross-match voting rolls with Homeland Security data in the past have resulted in high numbers of people being incorrectly identified as non-citizens. Plus, the department has the power to deport people.
In 2012, Florida looked to the Department of Homeland Security’s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database to help clean up its voter rolls. At the time, the departments of Homeland Security and Justice both warned that the system wasn’t a reliable way to identify who is and who is not a citizen.
“The use of the immigration databases are inaccurate, discriminatory and inappropriate for voter list maintenance. We know that it results in inaccurate purging of eligible voters,” said Katherine Culliton-González, a lawyer at think tank Demos who represented plaintiffs challenging Florida’s method of striking people from the rolls.
Furthermore, Culliton-González noted that ICE has “jurisdiction to deport people if there are allegations brought about someone who is not a citizen voting. That’s very, very intimidating and that’s why I’m so concerned about these false allegations.”
Meanwhile, the data collected by Trump’s commission is unlikely to produce reliable information about voting fraud either because it’s not comprehensive. As of October, only 20 states had sent the commission their data and that information wasn’t standardized. The lack of precision raises the risk of false positives, especially if officials are inclined to find fraud.
“What likely would come from an analysis is a pretty dramatic overestimate of non-citizen voting in the U.S.,” said Michael McDonald, a law professor at the University of Florida. “You could easily be rounding up people who are not citizens of the U.S. who didn’t even register to vote and didn’t vote. ... These are people here legally, under our immigration programs, maybe on their way to citizenship, but just because of a bad match they are rounded up and deported.”
Citizens and legal voters could also be erroneously identified as non-citizens and illegal voters, McDonald noted.
Kobach, who did not return multiple requests for comment from OutletName, told OutletName News that he will work closely with the White House and Homeland Security to continue the hunt for voter fraud. Among the documents he plans to turn over to the department are a Heritage Foundation database of voter fraud and a study by a conservative nonprofit co-founded by Steve Bannon that claimed to show thousands of examples of double voting.
However, Homeland Security spokesman Tyler Houlton told OutletName on Thursday that Kobach was not advising the department. He declined to explain what particular issues the department would be probing.
“At the President’s direction, the Department continues to work in support of state governments who are responsible for administering elections, with efforts focused on securing elections against those who seek to undermine the election system or its integrity,” Houlton said in a statement.
Kobach told Politico that it made sense for Homeland Security to take over the probe because the department recently designated elections as “critical infrastructure.” But Culliton-González said that move gave Homeland Security jurisdiction over things like cybersecurity and voting machines, not individual voter fraud.
James Norton, who worked as deputy assistant secretary of legislative affairs at Homeland Security from 2003 to 2007, said he was surprised a voter fraud inquiry would wind up there. The Justice Department, which in fact found little evidence of voter fraud during a five-year investigation over a decade ago, would be better equipped, he said.
“It’s outside the scope of the mission” of Homeland Security, Norton told OutletName. “You’re never going to find the answer if [the investigation is] under-staffed and under-resourced.”
Asked why the White House had chosen Homeland Security and not Justice to take up the voter fraud investigation at Thursday’s media briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders had nothing to offer beyond “That was the agency that was best determined by the administration.”
It may not be all that easy for the Department of Homeland Security to get busy hunting for voter fraud. While the now-defunct commission had broad latitude to collect information on Americans, federal law requires Homeland Security to go through certain processes to do so. If the commission were to simply hand over the voter roll data, that would likely invite further lawsuits. The White House said one of the reasons it was disbanding the panel was that a slew of lawsuits was impeding its efforts.
State election officials who entrusted the commission to protect the privacy of their voter information should be concerned about it ending up with another government agency, according to David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer and now head of the Center for Election Innovation and Research.
“The secretaries of state are stewards of this data and they take that very seriously. I don’t know a single one that doesn’t. When you have data that was meant for voting purposes [being] repurposed for a law enforcement purpose by another agency, that would raise concerns,” he said.
Becker added that Homeland Security’s new mandate to focus on individual voter fraud could distract from its recent progress in coordinating with local election officials to combat the greater threat of hacking. U.S. intelligence officials agree that Russia tried to interfere in the 2016 election, and 21 states had their electoral systems targeted by hackers last year.
“If they get dragged by the White House away from the real problem to this wild goose chase,” Becker said, “it could have a really negative impact on how well that cooperation goes and that cooperation is essential.”",1
405,"Deportation of illegal immigrants hit a 10-year low during President Obama’s last full fiscal year in office. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also appeared to be cutting back on information provided about all three of its law enforcement agencies.
The administration waited until the last Friday of the year to release its final FY 2016 report on Immigration and Customs Enforcement removal operations.
“It’s no wonder that they waited for a day when hardly a soul was paying attention; the numbers for ICE are abysmal, even worse than 2015,” Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Studies Jessica Vaughn reported this week. If there were an award for government reports that aim to obfuscate and spin, I would nominate this one.”
Vaughn wrote that the annual reports have historically provided basic statistics from all three of the department’s law enforcement agencies. This year, the report sneaked out by DHS officials on the last working day of the month normally, in two versions, was scaled back to provide only a fraction of the information normally disclosed. The reported is compiled by the Office of Immigration Statistics (OIS) which has a new director, Marc Rosenblum.
Vaughn listed the following as key findings from the annual report:
Deportations credited to ICE in 2016 increased by 2 percent. All of the increase came from cases of aliens arrested by the Border Patrol, not interior enforcement.
Interior deportations fell from 69,478 in 2015 to 65,322 in 2016, out of a population of illegal aliens now estimated at 12 million.
Deportations of criminal aliens fell from 63,127 in 2015 to 60,318 in 2016, out of an estimated population of two million.
The total number of deportations under the Obama administration is not easily comparable to prior administrations because of the number of border cases included, but it certainly is not record-breaking, as Obama has claimed.
DHS maintains that CBP arrests have always been a large share of ICE deportations, but in fact this is a new development under the Obama Administration. In prior administrations, only a third of deportations credited to ICE were border cases; now about two-thirds are.
One of the priorities of the Obama Administration was supposed to be deporting criminal aliens and others designated under the Priority Enforcement Program introduced in November 2014. OutletName Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby dubbed the program “Catch and Release 2.0” in an article published in January 2015.
“Before these changes,” a federal agent with U.S. Customs and Border Protection told OutletName Texas at the time, “all illegal aliens arrested by Border Patrol were required to enter the deportation system where they would be scheduled for a deportation hearing at a future date. Under this new system, the illegal aliens are not even required to show up for a hearing ever.”
“Not only are we releasing these people with no hearings scheduled, no notice to appear, but the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] is forcing Border Patrol to prepare the initial paperwork for the illegal aliens’ work permits.” The source added, “Americans really need to think about the terrorism-related implications of this. Illegal aliens who are suspected of having terrorism ties, but not convicted, could be permitted to stay in the country.”
The impact of the new program has been dramatic in a negative way. The charts below show the dramatic decline of interior deportations (called removals by the DHS) and the removal of criminal aliens from the U.S.:
Vaughn reported that 98 percent of all interior deportations were convicted criminals. This means that other migrants who have been crossing the border in massive numbers for the past several years are simply allowed to stay.
Even though the removal of criminal aliens made up nearly all of the interior deportations, the numbers of criminals being deported also continued to fall from previous years. This is not because the country is running out of criminal aliens to deport.
“The main reason for the decline is the Obama administration’s prioritization scheme that has steadily narrowed the types of cases that ICE officers are permitted to pursue.
The total number of removals (deportations and voluntary returns) increased by less than 5,000 in FY 2016 compared to FY 2015. However, the total deportation number of 240,000 aliens is 41 percent lower than the peak FY 2012 numbers.
“Obama has the lowest rate of deportations since the Nixon Administration,” Vaughn stated. “The administration and its allies frequently point out that more than two million removals have occurred since 2009, an accomplishment that they characterize as record-breaking.”
Vaughn explains why this is not true:
But counting only removals as deportations presents a misleading picture of the level of enforcement. Removals are just one form of the deportation process that can be executed by any of the three DHS enforcement agencies (ICE, Border Patrol, and CBP officers at the port of entry). All three enforcement agencies also can process deportable aliens as a return (sometimes known as voluntary return), which is a lesser consequence. In general most border deportations are processed as returns and most interior deportations are processed as removals, but in recent years many more aliens apprehended at the border have been turned over to ICE for a brief period of detention and then removed in recent years, in a departure from the traditional “you catch ’em, you clean ’em” policies, where the arresting agency typically handles the deportation process. In addition, illegal border-crossers who have been removed previously, or who are prosecuted for smuggling or other crimes are turned over to ICE for processing. Under these scenarios, the Border Patrol will count the case as an apprehension, which is their marquee enforcement metric, and ICE will count the case as a deportation. Under Obama, a much larger number of Border Patrol cases were transferred to ICE for processing than had been the case under prior administrations. In 2008, the last year of the George W. Bush administration, just over a third of deportations credited to ICE were border cases, and two-thirds were interior cases. In 2016, more than two-thirds of the deportation cases credited to ICE were border cases, and less than a third were interior cases.
Rather than using removals as the measurement, Vaughn suggests that a more “apples-to-apples” comparison can be made by examining interior deportations and border removals separately. “Neither the Border Patrol nor CBP publishes the total number of deportations executed, and many of the cases are transferred to ICE, so year-by-year comparisons of border deportations alone are impossible using open source statistics,” she stated.
Using these methods, Vaughn concluded that the Obama Administration has completed a total of 5.3 million deportations (both interior and border removals. That number represents about half of those same actions under the administration of then-President George W. Bush. It is not the Obama Administration that holds the record for deportations. Rather, it is the Clinton Administration record with 12.3 million deportations reported.
The following chart provided by the CIS reveals the average number of deportations reported annually:
Vaughn was extremely critical of the content of the new annual report released by first-year Director Rosenblum. ”The first set of reports prepared under the tenure of new OIS Director Marc Rosenblum, formerly of the Migration Policy Institute, are of dubious value,” she stated. She explained that the previous year’s reported provided numerous data tables and explanatory materials providing a more neutral view of actions taken by the department. Typically, those reports would provide data covering multiple years for comparison.
“The new reports include only one set of actual enforcement statistics with only five numbers drawn from DHS systems — repeat, five enforcement statistics,” Vaughn reported. “Specifically, OIS is reporting: the number of inadmissibility determinations at the port of entry; the number of Border Patrol apprehensions; the number of ICE arrests, the number of book-ins to detention, and the total number of deportations. No numbers are provided for prior years, but percentage changes from 2015 are reported.”
Vaughn concluded that the immigration issue will continue to be one of the most important and contentious policy matters facing the new President and his administration. “The incoming Trump administration and Congress must insist that DHS return to a relatively standardized and apolitical manner of publishing the vital statistics of the immigration agencies in order to support this discussion.”

316,"Young Republicans and President Trump supporters are the most skeptical of the United States’ mass legal and illegal immigration policy, a new Harvard poll finds.  The latest Harvard Insitute of Politics (IOP) Youth polls reveals that Trump’s youngest supporters — 18 to 29-year-olds — and young Republican voters are largely skeptical of immigration and its benefits that are routinely touted by big business interests, corporate executives, and the open borders lobby.  The poll discovered that nearly 4-in-10, or almost 40 percent, of Republican voters between 18 and 29-years-old said they disagree that recent immigration to the U.S. has done more good than harm. Similarly, about 41 percent of Trump supporters in that age bracket said the same.  Only about 26 percent of young GOP voters and young Trump supporters agreed that recent immigration has been a net bonus to the U.S. The Harvard IOP Youth poll found that young people, overall, were split on whether the country’s national immigration system — which admits more than 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants annually — was a benefit or not to Americans. While 31 percent of young people said they believed recent immigration has done more good than harm, nearly 30 percent disagreed. Roughly 37 percent said they neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement. Young swing voters were more likely than not to disagree that immigration has done more good than harm to the U.S., and among young white voters, about 35 percent said they disagreed that recent immigration has been a net positive for the country. Less than 30 percent of young white voters said the opposite. Young American college graduates, specifically, have been subjected to competing against a growing number of foreign visa workers that businesses and corporations import to take high-paying, professional jobs every year. Through the H-1B visa program, alone, businesses last year attempted to outsource nearly 420,000 U.S. professional jobs — many in the STEM fields — to foreign workers. The poll comes as Trump gears up for his 2020 re-election bid amidst soaring illegal immigration levels at the U.S.-Mexico border and a mass legal immigration policy that has yet to be reformed.",0
1111,"The Trump administration will end protections for certain nationals of El Salvador, a move that could leave more than 200,000 immigrants who have lived in the US more than 15 years without any legal status, the Department of Homeland Security announced Monday.
The termination will come with an 18-month delay, as the administration also recently did in ending other recent Temporary Protected Status for other countries. That time will allow individuals who have lived under the status to either seek other means of staying in the US or prepare to leave. The delay means the more than 250,000 TPS protectees will have until September 9, 2019, to either find a different way to stay in the US or prepare to leave.
The widely expected move culminates a series of similar decisions from the Trump administration to substantially curtail the use of Temporary Protected Status -- a protection from deportation and authorization to live and work legally for nationals of countries that have suffered a disaster such as war, an epidemic or natural disasters.
The DHS says more than 250,000 Salvadorans -- all of whom are required to have lived in the US continually since 2001 -- are covered by TPS. Previous estimates by the department have put the number who will most likely be left without other protections around 200,000.
Part of broader administration push",1
1645,"They can be hard to spot — let alone take at face value — amid the usual spray of insults and bombast, but every now and then President Trump emits a very sensible idea.
Mr. Trump offered at least the appearance of such an idea when he strode into the White House briefing room late Wednesday and announced that he was open to a multiyear path to citizenship for the so-called Dreamers, hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. His words sent his surprised staff scrambling and heartened Democrats who have been seeking a just solution for these young people. Mr. Trump then flew off to Davos, Switzerland, where he was to proclaim America’s reclaimed greatness to the assembled elite.
Was the president serious about adopting these young immigrants as real Americans, with full rights, including the right to vote? Just days ago he rejected any sort of deal that would allow them to stay in this country. Anyone counting on Mr. Trump’s constancy and good faith — and that of Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader who has promised a debate on immigration as part of renewed budget talks — ought to be wary. And be prepared to shell out billions of dollars for a border wall as the price of presidential compassion.
In the heat of the struggle over the fate of the Dreamers, the current targets of the heartless anti-immigration crowd, what has often been obscured is how the broader debate has ominously moved beyond those who are in America illegally to immigration as a whole.
Among hard-core Republican foes of immigration, aided and abetted in the White House by President Trump’s fiercely anti-immigration senior adviser for policy, Stephen Miller, the goal is not only a crackdown on undocumented immigrants within the United States or a Great Wall along the Mexican border, but a sharply reduced number and a more restrictive profile of immigrants in general.
Though American immigration policy has been marked for much of the nation’s history by racism and injustice, a fundamental narrative has taken shape of the United States as a land shaped by waves of creative, hard-working immigrants, and as the great haven for “tempest-tossed” refugees from less fortunate lands.",1
1742,"The Trump administration’s report trying to link foreign-born immigrants to terrorism muddies the waters by giving an incomplete picture of the sources of extremist violence in America.
New data from the Anti-Defamation League confirms that over the last decade, native-born white supremacists and others identifying with far-right movements have been responsible for the vast majority of extremist-related murders in the United States.
More than 70 percent of all extremist-related killings in those years were linked to domestic right-wing extremists, while 26 percent of the killings were committed by Islamic extremists. And last year, in the heated political environment that led to Charlottesville, Va., deaths caused by white supremacists doubled year over year. Right-wing extremists were directly responsible for 20 of the total 34 extremist-related murders in 2017.

1724,"That first travel ban, and each subsequent one, made my stomach lurch, as I imagined not being allowed back into the place I belong. And since that chaotic weekend two years ago, I have wondered what life has been like for immigration lawyers — people whose livelihoods depend on getting others through a door that was only ever ajar and is now in danger of slamming shut.
As the administration hacks away at immigrants’ rights and rains down policy changes, immigration requests that would usually have been approved are denied, many lawyers told me. They are receiving requests for further evidence that are baffling, with precedents continuously blurring. “Any way the government can have a moment of ‘gotcha’ they do and they will,” Ms. Gupta said. “If they can get you out of the country, they will.”
John Khosravi, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles, agrees. “These past two years it’s like someone is running around sticking their finger in people’s eyes and I’m an eye doctor,” he said. “Sure, business is good, but those aren’t the injuries I want to treat.”
On his podcast “The Immigration Lawyers Podcast,” he urges his colleagues to have a Plan B and to save their money for a rainy day. Mr. Khosravi is Iranian-American, and when he started practicing nearly a decade ago, all of his clients were Iranian. Since then, he has diversified and now has clients from around the world. “Had I just been starting out when the ban came down, that would have been lights out, just no way,” he said.

821,"OutletName called one of President Donald Trump’s Facebook posts concerning Muslims racist, implying the religion of Islam is actually a race.
TheNYT asserted Muslims are a race in an article entitled Delay, Deny and Deflect: How Facebook’s Leaders Fought Through Crisis, concerning Facebook’s potential to spread racist ideals, among other things. The author highlighted a Facebook post from Trump calling for a “‘total and complete shutdown’ on Muslims entering the United States” as an example of said racism. “Then Donald J. Trump ran for president. He described Muslim immigrants and refugees as a danger to America, and in December 2015 posted a statement on Facebook calling for a ‘total and complete shutdown’ on Muslims entering the United States. Mr. Trump’s call to arms — widely condemned by Democrats and some prominent Republicans — was shared more than 15,000 times on Facebook, an illustration of the site’s power to spread racist sentiment,” the piece reads.
The page linked in the Facebook post from Trump has since been taken down. Regardless, TheNYT’s take on the post is inaccurate at best, as Muslims are simply followers of the religion of Islam and represent many different races and ethnicities around the world.

467,"Border Patrol agents rescued a Mexican woman after she fell while illegally entering the U.S. with her boyfriend. The woman fractured her spine after dropping from a 20-foot cliff and was airlifted for treatment.
Border Patrol agents assigned to the El Centro Sector utilized the Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) to detect a man who had recently crossed the border illegally from Mexico into southern California. The man appeared to be trying to attract attention by waving his arms wildly, according to information obtained by OutletName Texas from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials.
Border Patrol agents located the man and learned his girlfriend, who illegally crossed the border with him from Mexico, had fallen down a 20-foot cliff. The agents quickly backtracked the man’s path and found the 22-year-old woman. She told the agents she injured her back in the fall.
Agents contacted local emergency medical responders to come to the woman’s assistance. The EMS team determined the woman needed to be transported via helicopter to a local hospital for treatment.
A REACH helicopter crew flew to the scene and provided transportation to a nearby trauma center.
Agents later learned that an MRI evaluation revealed the woman had suffered a fractured spine. She will require additional medical attention for her injury before she can be processed for removal.

663,"Ellis Island began processing immigrants into the U.S. on Jan. 1, 1892 — 127 years ago.
Fifteen-year-old Irish immigrant Annie Moore was the first to cross through the Ellis Island Immigration station, according to the Library of Congress. She would be one of more than 12 million people who would pass through the entry port in New York Harbor, which operated for 62 years.
About 2 percent of those who went to Ellis Island were denied entry, according to History.
Ellis Island was built to accommodate the nearly 600,000 immigrants who were coming to America in the late 1800s, FamilySearch reported. The Castle Garden Emigration Landing Port in New York, where many of the immigrants were processed prior to Ellis Island, could not handle the massive number of people coming into the U.S.
Those who successfully made it past inspection were able to exchange money and buy rail tickets on Ellis Island itself. The detained stayed in the dorms or a hospital on the island, according to FamilySearch.
Getting past the immigration port required having the proper documents and being in good health.
Immigrants also had to answer 29 questions on their personal information and U.S. history.
Many of the Ellis Island immigrants came from Europe. Eastern European Jews, specifically, migrated in an effort to flee religious persecution.
One of the myths about Ellis Island is that people with long, tricky-to-spell last names had to change them to make them easier to pronounce upon arrival. Name changes would normally occur prior to stepping foot on American soil when the ship’s cargo list was written in Europe, according to OutletName.
Ships could carry a wide range of passengers hoping for entry, from 1,000 to up to 10,000, according to History. The largest number of immigrants passing through in a day was 11,747 on April 17, 1907, Time reported.
Laws in 1921 and 1924 decreased immigration, with a steady decline of foreign-born U.S. residents until after the 1965 amendments to the Immigration and Naturalization Act went into effect, which included family reunification and refugee quotas, according to the Pew Research Center.
Former President Lyndon B. Johnson also declared Ellis Island as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument, according to the Statue of Liberty — Ellis Island Foundation.",0
844,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday praised Miami-Dade County as a model for local cooperation on immigration enforcement, while blasting Chicago for its continued defiance of the Trump administration’s immigration agenda.
In a speech at the Port of Miami on Wednesday afternoon, Sessions will draw a sharp distinction between Miami-Dade, which earlier this year reversed its “sanctuary city” policy, and Chicago, which last week sued the administration for attaching new immigration detention requirements to federal law enforcement grants.
“Miami-Dade is an example of what is possible through hard work and a rededication to the rule of law,” Sessions plans to say, according to speech excerpts provided to reporters. “It is proof that the entire nation can do better.”
As for Chicago, Sessions says the city’s immigration policies are “just one sad example” of local politicians protecting lawbreakers at the expense of public safety.
“Respect for the rule of law has broken down [in Chicago],” he says.
The Miami-Dade county commission voted in February to drop its sanctuary status and boost cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. Jail officials had previously honored ICE immigration detention requests only in cases where criminal aliens had been arrested for violent crimes. The revised policy expanded cooperation to all ICE detainers, regardless of the underlying criminal offense.
Miami-Dade officials defended the move, which angered many in the heavily Hispanic and immigrant county, as a necessary measure to guarantee continued access to federal community policing grants. In an Aug. 4 letter to Mayor Carlos Gimenez, the Department of Justice said “there was no evidence” Miami-Dade was out of compliance with an immigration-related conditions on a $480,000 grant due to the county this year.
Chicago, on the other hand, has staked out a position as one of the nation’s most unapologetic sanctuary cities. Mayor Rahm Emanuel has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration’s tough approach to immigration enforcement and vowed to maintain Chicago’s longtime sanctuary city status.
On Aug. 7, the city asked a federal judge to prevent DOJ from enforcing new immigration guidelines attached to the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program.
During his remarks in Miami, Sessions will tie Chicago’s sanctuary policies to its soaring murder rate, which has reached levels not seen for 20 years. In contrast, Miami-Dade’s willingness to assist immigration officials has made the county much safer, he argues.
“I know that Miami-Dade will be an example of the good that comes from following the law,” Sessions says. “We have already seen that: the same Independence Day weekend when Chicago suffered more than 100 shootings and 15 homicides, Miami-Dade also had a historic number of shooting deaths — zero.”",0
79,"Illegal immigrant families received nearly $1.3 billion in Los Angeles County welfare money during 2015 and 2016, nearly one-​quarter of the amount spent on the county’s entire needy population, according to data obtained by OutletName. The data was obtained from the county Department of Public Social Services -- which is responsible for doling out the benefits -- and gives a snapshot of the financial costs associated with sanctuary and related policies. The sanctuary county of Los Angeles is an illegal immigration epicenter, with the largest concentration of any county ​in the nation, according to a study from the Migration Policy Institute. ​The county also allows illegal immigrant parents with children born in the United States to seek welfare and food stamp benefits. Robert Rector, a Heritage Foundation senior fellow who has written extensive studies on poverty and illegal immigration, said the costs represent “the tip of the iceberg.” He said the costs of education, police and fire, medical, and subsidized housing can total $24,000 per year in government spending per family, much more than would be paid in taxes. “They get $3 in benefits for every $1 they spend,” Rector said. The Trump presidency’s hardline immigration policies, though, may be playing some role in curtailing the population seeking welfare payments in recent months. The same stats show Los Angeles County is expected to dole out $200 million less this year than in 2016, and several thousand fewer families are collecting benefits. “The number of entrants nationwide is going down. The population is static if not shrinking,” Rector said. The welfare benefit data from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services shows: During the first five months of 2017, more than 60,000 families received a total of $181 million.
Welfare and food stamp costs for the county’s entire population were $3.1 billion in 2015, $2.9 billion in 2016 and $1.5 billion so far in 2017.
Roughly a quarter of California’s 4 million illegal immigrants reside in Los Angeles County. In 2013, California spent a total of $25.3 billion on illegal immigrants – or $2,370 per U.S. citizen household, according to a 2013 study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform. Texas and New York were second and third, at $12.1 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively. Former state Republican Party Chairman Shawn Steel blasted Los Angeles policies but credited Immigration and Customs Enforcement with stepping up deportations. “The amazing thing is that everyone was expecting a big wall to stop [illegal immigration],” he said. “The decrease has been enhanced dramatically by ICE agents just doing their job.” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, a proponent of the city’s sanctuary status, is a driving factor behind expanding immigrant benefits. He founded the Office of Immigrant Affairs shortly after taking office in 2013 to help immigrants navigate the maze of government benefits. “Immigration is at the heart of LA’s story,” he said in a written statement. “LA’s become one of the world’s great cities by embracing immigration and diversity and we’ll continue supporting anyone who wants to work hard and invest in our future – no matter who they are, where they came from or what language they speak.”",0
839,"An aid group sympathetic to the migrant caravan currently parked in Tijuana says some members of the group are planning to scramble across the U.S. border en masse.
According to OutletName, Angels without Borders founder Sergio Tamai talked to San Diego’s Spanish-language media Telemundo 20 and said, “They have that intention. I believe that thousands could make that jump.”
There are about 3,000 migrants camping out in Tijuana with many more on the way. The locals have not exactly been welcoming, with the mayor and an angry mob calling the would-be Central American refugees “an invasion” and calling them “criminals” and “freeloaders.”
The Department Of Homeland Security is warning Americans that the migrants are not an innocuous collection of women and children. It is uncertain what happens next. A federal judge nixed President Donald Trump’s plans to order a temporary halt to illegal immigrants obtaining refugee status. If the migrants are allowed to apply for asylum, it could take six months to assess their claims.
But many of the migrants aren’t prepared to wait for due process and tell Telemundo that they are prepared to break-in to the United States.
“Most of us, yes — we want to be on the other side,” said Jorge Molina, from Honduras. “Some want to jump over the wall, others to go another way, and others want to wait and see what kind of response they get.” The migrant caravan has attracted controversy and notoriety from the beginning of its trek from Honduras. There have been numerous clashes with Mexican authorities.
A OutletName report detailed how some of the migrants are armed with guns and Molotov cocktails that could be still be used in any border confrontation. One migrant offhandedly told a reporter about his conviction for attempted murder, but said he was sure a pardon awaited him in the United States.",0
1727,"What most people heard in Mr. Mulvaney’s comment was that Mr. Trump would negotiate with Congress for funding but that if talks reached an impasse, he would sign the spending bill and then use his executive authority to order construction of a wall. He should use that authority if Congress fails. As John Eastman, a constitutional law professor at Chapman University, has explained, the law gives “the president the authority he needs to direct existing appropriations toward construction of a border security wall, once he has declared a national emergency.” The question is why Mr. Trump has not already done so.
He made his case in a televised speech from the Oval Office a month ago and then virtually dropped the issue, except for a few tweets chiding Democrats for partying with lobbyists in Puerto Rico during the shutdown. Mr. Trump reiterated some of the jarring statistics in the State of the Union address: “In the last two years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 killings” and that “one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.”
Our government’s failure to secure the border has precipitated a political, economic and moral crisis. The fact that we not only permit, but by our dereliction, actively encourage gangsters to traffic in human beings across our border is a disgrace. It must end.
If Mr. Trump is planning to use executive authority to build the wall, he must continue to make the case the way he did in the State of the Union address. He must educate and persuade the American people, and that means he must continue to talk about it. If he does so, he will find that supporters of what the mathematician Eric Weinstein might call “xenophilic border security” — which is to say, well-disposed toward foreigners and foreign cultures, but wanting immigration laws enforced — will help him broaden and deepen the argument, but he must take the lead. The president would do well if he emphasized the degradation of human trafficking and the vast quantities of heroin, fentanyl and other drugs coming across the border that contribute to the more than 60,000 American deaths per year from opioid overdose. The State of the Union speech was a good start, but he needs to continue the drumbeat.
He should also explain that border security is tied to the economic security of the middle and working class whose prosperity is inextricably linked to their asymmetric access to the labor market in the United States. Part of our social compact is that American citizens benefit first and most from our economy. Mass immigration, especially of the illegal variety, breaks that compact and should be understood as one of the most effective means by which big business interests maintain power over the middle and working class. Identity politics, while a particularly virulent ideology and one that motivates many liberal activists, is in fact a cover for class warfare in which incumbent economic and political winners use the poor to maintain control over the broad, dynamic middle class.",1
453,"Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents stopped two previously deported sex offenders from successfully making their way back into the U.S. — one a child molester, the second, a rapist.
In separate incidents, Del Rio Sector agents apprehended two previously deported criminal aliens as they attempted to make their way back into the U.S. interior. Officials reported that agents assigned to the Carrizo Springs Station arrested a 53-year-old Mexican national on January 24 for illegally crossing the border. Agents transported the migrant to the station for processing where they discovered his criminal and immigration history, according to information obtained from Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials.
All migrants arrested by Border Patrol agents undergo a biometric background check to search for prior criminal history, gang affiliation, or immigration violations. In this case, records revealed that a court in Decatur, Illinois, convicted the Mexican national in 2012 for child molestation. The court sentenced the migrant to 10 years in state prison. Immigration officers deported the man in April 2017 after he served five years of the sentence.
Three days later, Brackettville Station agents arrested a 48-year-old Mexican national for illegal entry into the U.S., officials stated. During a background investigation, the agents learned that a court in La Grange, Kentucky, convicted the man in 1996 for rape. Immigration officers deported the criminal alien after he served two years of a five-year prison sentence, officials reported.
“Apprehensions like these highlight our commitment to the safety and security of our communities,” Del Rio Sector Acting Chief Patrol Agent Matthew J. Hudak said in a written statement. “Our agents work diligently every day to prevent dangerous individuals, like these two sex offenders, from entering our the county.”
Both migrants now face federal felony charges for illegal re-entry after removal as a sex offender. If convicted, the men could each face prison sentences of up to 20 years.

1146,"The executive orders President Donald Trump signed in Washington this week are paving the way for a sweeping overhaul of the US immigration system. And for people around the world, Trump's plans are personal.
A Mexican mother of five American children is afraid of what might happen if police pull her over. A Yemeni man with family in the United States worries he'll never be able to visit. An American man whose brother-in-law was killed by an undocumented immigrant is happy to hear border security has become a bigger priority.
People who could be directly impacted by this week's executive orders opened up to OutletName about their hopes and fears:
He worries he won't be able to visit his family
Yousif AlAkwa, 20, is an engineering student from Yemen whose parents live in California. He visited last year but left to finish his studies abroad. Now he's not sure whether he'll be able to come back.

1608,"As American politicians and business owners wrangle over the limits on the number of H-2B visas for unskilled, nonagricultural workers, Tlapacoyan (pronounced tla-pa-COY-an), with about 60,000 residents in the town and surrounding area, offers a glimpse of how the impasse has stung in Mexico. Last year, Mexicans received more than 70 percent of the approximately 84,000 H-2B visas issued by the United States to migrant workers worldwide.
The lack of visas has denied hundreds of families in the city an annual income that saves them from living hand-to-mouth and deepened the problems of a town struggling, like much of the state, with high crime rates. Of an estimated 4,600 to 6,000 residents who normally work the carnival season according to city officials and recruiters, about a third have been left behind.
Instead, they are selling tacos and driving taxis, or working for just over $1 an hour in the tangerine and banana fields that surround the town. Some use Google Translate and WhatsApp to check their visa status with their former American employers.
Mr. Trujillo is working as a driver for a construction crew, earning about $85 a week, less than a quarter of his carnival salary.
He used savings from his time in the United States to buy a plot of land and build a one-bedroom house, even splurging on a $350 stroller for his son, now 22 months old. This year, however, “there will be no proper Christmas, no presents, no turkey,” Mr. Trujillo said. He abandoned plans to take his son to a safari park in nearby Puebla state for his birthday. “I can barely make it day to day.”
Martín Peña, 34, who has spent two seasons with an Ohio-based amusement company but has not received a visa this year, said he had put off plans to buy a couch and a washing machine for his mother.
From the United States, Mr. Peña sent home as much as $300 a week from his take-home pay of about $345, eating fried chicken or cooking eggs with chili and tomato to save money. He tore down the wooden shack where he lives with his parents on the edge of Tlapacoyan and built cinder block walls. He also paid for his father’s treatment for typhoid.
As wrenching as it was to work far from his family, he said, managing without extra income was worse. “There is this anxiety that doesn’t go away,” he said.
The visa problems began in March when the summer allotment of H-2Bs ran out, leaving some American businesses scrambling for people to clean hotel rooms, run Ferris wheels and fish for shrimp. Demand for visas was high, said recruiters and experts, and Congress did not renew a provision that had excluded returning H-2B workers from counting against the total quota of 66,000 visas, which is split evenly between summer and winter.
Lawmakers in May then granted the government authority to more or less double the cap on this year’s quota to save “American business from irreparable harm,” and the White House on July 17 authorized an increase of 15,000 visas, bringing the total number available close to the number issued last year.
But business owners who have been waiting to bring seasonal workers said the requirements to apply for visas were onerous and that the extra visas were too few, too late.
Deborah Murray, one of the owners of Murray Brothers, a carnival company based in Cincinnati, said she had scaled back this year because she could not muster 30 reliable workers. She applied months ago for 12 visas for Mexican workers; she received four last week.
“You can never really recover,” said Ms. Murray, who spoke by telephone from a Cincinnati church festival where she said she was running five rides instead of the usual 10. “I’ve been working since April and I’m a week from August,” she said. “The season is gone.”
Critics of the current H-2B system said statistics did not support claims that American labor was scarce in sectors that use a lot of the visas, like landscaping, and that employers could fill the jobs with American workers if they paid more or recruited from outside their area.
The visa program also ties foreign workers to one employer, making them susceptible to exploitation, according to Daniel Costa, director of immigration law and policy research at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. Some recruiters demand payment, a practice banned in the United States, which saddles workers with debt and may make them more acquiescent.

Rather than having employers determine how many foreign workers they need, the government could set up an independent body to identify labor shortages and allocate visas, Mr. Costa said.

“It’s only fair to set the system in a way that they are not exploited,” he said, referring to migrant workers. “Otherwise employers will try to keep wages down.”
Most carnival workers in Tlapacoyan are hired through a pipeline run by James Judkins, a former circus performer and president of the JKJ Workforce agency, based in Harlingen, Tex., and his representative in Mexico, Victor Apolinar Barrios.
Residents recruited at the office of Mr. Apolinar — who is currently mayor of Tlapacoyan — said they believed he had made a fortune charging workers fees to secure jobs. None would agree to be quoted, saying they were afraid of spoiling their chances of getting work in the future.
Separately, labor advocates won tens of thousands of dollars in 2015 for workers after filing a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board against a union linked to Mr. Judkins, whose sister, Deborah Judkins, was its administrator. The complaint argued that the union, the Association of Mobile Entertainment Workers, was a sham organization that undermined workers by agreeing to weekly rather than hourly rates.
Arthur N. Read, general counsel of Friends of Farmworkers based in Philadelphia, who filed the complaint, said the settlement covered fees paid by workers to the union; a second settlement to cover backpay to workers is pending and could be far larger, he said.
Mr. Apolinar did not respond to several calls seeking comment, and aides said he was absent when journalists visited the mayor’s office, despite indications that he was present. Mr. Judkins said that his organization was very careful to follow the law and make sure no worker was charged illegal fees.
Despite accusations of underhanded or illegal practices by employers, several carnival workers who were waiting for visas this month said they enjoyed the carnival circuit.
Yes, there were days that stretched into the wee hours, patrons who vomited on the Zipper (a ride that involves being spun upside down in cages) and the occasional racist outburst from a parent whose child was not tall enough to board a ride. But there was also the chance to learn English, pick up some trendy, hand-me-down sneakers and leave the violence of Mexico behind.
Eduardo Torres, 25, who has worked two seasons for Murray Brothers in fairs across Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio, said he had never imagined traveling by airplane or visiting big cities. He marveled at what he called the “cool stuff” everywhere and picked up all sorts of used clothing. “It was a dream come true,” he said.
For Mr. Trujillo, whose favorite job was serving lemonade and hamburgers and learning English in the process — “like a little school” — the carnival became a window onto a more promising existence.
In the United States, said Mr. Trujillo, “if you dream about 15 things, you can buy five.”
In Tlapacoyan, he said, you dream, too. But when you open your eyes, of the things you dreamed about, “not one of them is there.”",1
854,"Political commentator Michelle Malkin said the Democratic stance on illegal immigration will carry over into the 2020 elections and have a negative impact on the party’s electoral results.
“When you have the Democrats booing because President Trump was exposing and continuing to hammer the fact that these caravans are endangering the country and posing enormous costs to people at the border, let alone in the interior, this is a message I think is going to resonate all the way through 2020, and it’s going to pose a huge optics problem for the Democrat party,” Malkin said.
“They can laugh and snicker and sneer and smirk and sit in their seats and have their little temper tantrums. But the vast majority of Americans want something done about immigration. And sitting there and smirking is not the answer.”
Malkin also said it was important for Trump to call attention to illegal immigration while offering solutions to ease the crisis. “I think it underscores an important point that President Trump himself has made in the face of this debate and the intransigence of the open borders Democrats — and that it’s not just about a wall. As long as you have these magnets drawing people here and everybody’s aware of it around the world, it’s not going to stop,” she said earlier in the interview.
“And that is a point that President Trump made during the address last night. … President Trump delivered very defining moments that contrast the differences between the parties.”",0
2073,"One year ago, Donald Trump stood at the U.S. Capitol and took his place as the nation’s 45th president. He promised to be a man of action, taking charge of a government for the people and away from the establishment.
“We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done,” Trump promised.
“We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action ― constantly complaining but never doing anything about it,” he added. “The time for empty talk is over.”
But exactly a year later, on the anniversary of Trump’s big day, the federal government is shut down.
Congress was unable to come to an agreement to keep the government funded by midnight Friday, resulting in the first shutdown since 2013.
Trump and his GOP allies tried to pin the blame on Democrats, even attempting to give it the name #SchumerShutdown.
The fact remains, however, that Republicans control the White House, the House and the Senate. For years, they blamed Democrats for obstruction and told voters to give them full control of the executive and legislative branches so that they could finally govern.
But Republicans were unable to do the most basic task Friday night: Keep the federal government’s lights on.
In the most recent government shutdowns, the presidency and Congress have been controlled by different parties ― and they’ve pointed fingers at each other over who gets the blame. (The public has generally faulted the GOP-led Congress.)
But in this case, Republicans will be trying to argue that Democrats ― who control nothing because they’re in the minority ― are the ones at fault.
It’s clear, however, that the Trump administration is nervous about the fallout. The Department of the Interior was figuring out a way to keep national parks open during the shutdown, recognizing during the 2013 shutdown that the shuttered entrances and frustrated tourists became potent symbols of what Congress’ dysfunction had wrought.
One of Trump’s major selling points during the campaign was his ability to make deals. He could sit down with people and get them to agree to things that no one else could.
But Trump is part of the reason that Washington has found itself in such a mess this week.
Trump, after all, was the one who removed the protections for the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, telling Congress that lawmakers had to instead put in place a measure to protect them.
Democrats, at various times, have believed that Trump would support a deal to protect the Dreamers, in exchange for certain border security measures. But that optimism was blown up last week when Trump reportedly denigrated immigrants from Haiti and African nations, saying they were “shithole” countries and he’d rather see people come from Norway, a very white European nation.
Trump received widespread criticism for his remarks, and the next day he announced there would be no bipartisan deal.
The Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate ― along with the Republicans in the House and the Republicans in the Senate ― were unable to come to an agreement by the funding deadline Friday night, and now the federal government is shut down.
The last time the federal government shut down, in 2013, about 800,000 workers were furloughed without pay, and this time, a similar number is expected to be affected.
And Trump, despite his rhetoric in his inaugural address, is ill-prepared to deal with the shutdown. Federal employees said Friday that they had barely received any guidance about what to do in the event of a shutdown ― a big difference from what happened in 2013, under President Barack Obama. Trump still has failed to nominate people for a sizable number of important positions in the government, and many of the people in his administration don’t have experience dealing with past crises.
In his book The Art of the Deal, Trump boasts, “Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That’s how I get my kicks.”
But the first year of his presidency has exposed the hollowness of that rhetoric, showing it takes more than simply talking big to run the government.",1
1924,"As the record-breaking partial government shutdown continues into week four, it has triggered the cancellation of a staggering 42,726 immigration hearings, a new report estimates.
That number is expected to rise dramatically.
The study released Monday by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse calculated the total of nixed hearings from Dec. 24, after the start of the shutdown, to Jan. 11, noting that the tally would likely grow by 20,000 for each additional week the government fails to reopen.
That means up to 100,000 individuals waiting on their court dates may be affected if the shutdown, caused by the impasse over border wall funding, reaches the end of the month.
While those numbers aren’t official, TRAC analyzed court records to arrive at the estimates.
Among the states hit hardest are California, New York, Texas and Florida, altogether accounting for more than half of the cancellations.
The stalled hearings will only further jam up immigration courts across the country, which already have massive backlogs.
As TRAC pointed out, San Francisco Immigration Court Judge Dana Leigh Marks, former president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, told PBS News last week the shutdown has had “a devastating impact.”
“Many of the cases that are being canceled for the shutdown have been on my docket already for two or three or four years, and now I have no time in the foreseeable future to reset them,” she said. “It could be another three or four years before those people can expect hearings on their cases.”
Though the delays are a headache for some, Arizona immigration attorney Maurice Goldman explained to OutletName earlier this month that “it may actually be a blessing in disguise.”
That’s because it gives additional time for immigrants who may not qualify for asylum status to remain in the U.S. and potentially qualify for an alternative status. By that same token, however, a delayed hearing could allow currently qualifying immigrants to be disqualified later on if immigration policies tighten up.
Philadelphia immigration lawyer Matthew Archambeault told OutletName that he avoids talking about the what-ifs too much with his clients.",1
1703,"The call with Mr. Turnbull was even more testy as the president complained about what he called “a disgusting deal” that Australia had sealed with President Barack Obama in which the United States agreed to consider accepting up to 1,250 economic refugees. Mr. Trump complained that he would look “so foolish” doing so after barring refugees from the rest of the world.
“I have had it,” Mr. Trump snapped toward the end of the call. “I have been making these calls all day, and this is the most unpleasant call all day. Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.”
Transcripts of a president’s conversations with foreign leaders are rarely made public, and the disclosure of these may fuel Mr. Trump’s ire over unauthorized leaks. The Post did not say how it obtained them.
But the full accounts of the conversations illustrated Mr. Trump’s approach with foreign leaders — flattering his counterpart one moment, badgering him the next, always conscious of how the policies being discussed connected to his campaign promises and how they would affect his domestic political standing.
Fresh from his inauguration, he had his campaign victory on his mind, boasting to Mr. Peña Nieto that “no one got people in the rallies as big as I did” and to Mr. Turnbull that “they said I had no way to get to 270” votes in the Electoral College “and I got 306.” He buttered up Mr. Peña Nieto, telling the interpreter on their call that “he speaks better English than me,” suggesting that the Mexican president would be so popular that the Mexican people will amend their constitution to allow him to run again and declaring that “it is you and I against the world, Enrique, do not forget.”
But there was an edge to both conversations as he sought to bring his campaign platform to fruition. The talk with Mr. Peña Nieto on Jan. 27 came after the Mexican leader canceled a meeting with Mr. Trump because of their dispute over who would pay for the proposed border wall. The two never resolved that on the call, with both men clearly worried about the political effect in their own countries.
“We find this completely unacceptable for Mexicans to pay for the wall that you are thinking of building,” Mr. Peña Nieto told Mr. Trump, explaining how precarious his position was at home. “I would also like to make you understand, President Trump, the lack of margin I have as president of Mexico to accept this situation.” Mr. Trump too was conscious of his own position:“On the wall, you and I both have political problem. My people stand up and say, ‘Mexico will pay for the wall,’ and your people probably say something in a similar but slightly different language. But the fact is we are both in a little bit of a political bind because I have to have Mexico pay for the wall. I have to. I have been talking about it for a two-year period.”
Mr. Trump suggested papering over the dispute in public comments: “We should both say, ‘We will work it out.’ It will work out in the formula somehow. As opposed to you saying, ‘We will not pay’ and me saying, ‘We will not pay.’”
Mr. Peña Nieto told Mr. Trump that he had put him in a bad position. “You have a very big mark on our back, Mr. President, regarding who pays for the wall,” he said. “This is what I suggest, Mr. President:Let us stop talking about the wall.”
He added that he understood that any country had the right to protect its border. “But my position has been and will continue to be very firm saying that Mexico cannot pay for that wall.” “But you cannot say that to the press,” Mr. Trump complained. “The press is going to go with that, and I cannot live with that. You cannot say that to the press because I cannot negotiate under those circumstances.”
Mr. Peña Nieto repeated that they should stop talking about the wall. “I understand the critical political position that this constitutes for your country and for you, Mr. President,” he said. “Let us look for a creative way to jump over this obstacle.”
Mr. Trump’s call with Mr. Turnbull the next day, Jan. 28, proved more combative. Mr. Trump said he had been told that he had to accept refugees held by Australia on the islands of Nauru or Manus for more than three years.
“Somebody told me yesterday that close to 2,000 people are coming who are really troublesome,” he complained to Mr. Turnbull. “And I am saying, boy that will make us look awfully bad. Here I am calling for a ban where I am not letting anybody in and we take 2,000 people. Really, it looks like 2,000 people that Australia does not want and I do not blame you, by the way, but the United States has become like a dumping ground.” Mr. Turnbull explained that the deal did not require the United States to take 2,000 people but it was important for the United States to live up to its commitment. “This is a big deal,” he said. “I think we should respect deals.”
“Who made the deal?” Mr. Trump asked. “Obama?”
“Yes,” Mr. Turnbull said, “but let me describe what it is.” The United States had agreed only to consider accepting up to 1,250 refugees, but each of them would be subject to vetting and could be rejected. The people at issue were economic refugees, mainly from Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, he said, not criminals or terrorists.
“Why haven’t you let them out?” Mr. Trump demanded. “Why have you not let them into your society?”
“It is not because they are bad people,” Mr. Turnbull said. “It is because in order to stop people-smugglers, we have to deprive them of the product.” Australia by policy, he said, refuses to accept refugees who arrive by boat because it would encourage smugglers to keep charging desperate people to bring them there.
“That is a good idea,” Mr. Trump said. “We should do that too. You are worse than I am.”
Mr. Turnbull implored the president to abide by the agreement. “I am asking you as a very good friend. This is a big deal. It is really, really important to us that we maintain it.”
“Malcolm, why is this so important?” Mr. Trump said. “I do not understand. This is going to kill me. I am the world’s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country.” Going along with the deal “puts me in a bad position.”
He added, “It makes me look so bad and I have only been here a week.”
Mr. Turnbull repeated that it was only 1,250 people, each of them subject to vetting.
“I will be honest with you, I hate taking these people,” Mr. Trump said. “I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people.” “I would not be so sure about that,” Mr. Turnbull said.
“Well, maybe you should let them out of prison. I am doing this because Obama made a bad deal.”
“But I can say to you, there is nothing more important in business or politics than a deal is a deal,” Mr. Turnbull said.
“This is a stupid deal,” Mr. Trump said. “This deal will make me look terrible.”
“Mr. President, I think this will make you look like a man who stands by the commitments of the United States.”
Mr. Trump was not buying it. “O.K., this shows me to be a dope,” he said. “I am not like this but if I have to do it, I will do it, but I do not like this at all.”
He said that he worried that the terrorists like those who killed Americans in Boston, San Bernardino and New York could be admitted to the country:“I am going to get killed on this thing.”
“You will not,” Mr. Turnbull insisted.
“Yes, I will be seen as a weak and ineffective leader in my first week by these people. This is a killer.”",1
517,"An Arizona group that tracks deaths of migrants in the southern Arizona desert reports that 12 have died this year after crossing from Mexico. Officials discovered the bodies between January 2nd and February 27.
All of the migrants are unidentified as their remains had decomposed by the time of discovery. This makes determining the identity of the deceased, their nation of origin, and the time and manner of death difficult to determine, Pima County Medical Examiner Dr. Gregory Hess told OutletName Texas Monday.
“We have been experiencing this problem for a very long time,” Dr. Hess explained. “When the migrants decide to attempt to walk through the desert, there is not much margin for error. If something goes wrong, it can certainly be very dangerous.”
Hess said his county processes the remains of about 160 migrants per year. He confirmed the deaths of the 12 so far this year and explained they are continuing their attempts to identify them.
“The bodies that are left exposed to the elements can decompose very quickly,” the medical examiner explained. “In about a month, the birds and animals will leave behind skeletal remains.”
Art students are attempting to help in the identification of the remains found in southern Arizona, OutletName Texas reported in January.
Sculptors from the New York Academy of Art recently fashioned 3D facial reconstructions of eight men recovered after they died while illegally crossing the U.S. border with Mexico, the OutletName reported. The skulls are held in the Pima County, Arizona, medical examiner’s office because officials are unable to identify the victims.
In addition to sculptures, the art students are employing 3D technology to create images using information provided by medical examiners, including the estimated height, weight, sex, nationality, and ages of the missing migrants. Following the creation of the likeness of the deceased, photographs are taken and the information is sent to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs).
About 50 percent of the remains are discovered by Border Patrol agents during their routine patrols, Hess stated. “The remainder are discovered by hunters, hikers, ranchers, and ATV riders.”
Most of the deaths occur from exposure and lack of water. Hess said they occasionally find evidence of homicides caused by gunshot wounds or other violent trauma. Between Fiscal Years 2000 and 2017 a little more than 80 migrants died from gunshot wounds.
The 2016 Pima County Medical Examiner’s Annual Report reveals that the majority of migrants deaths occur between May and September.
Hess explained that his office provides services to Pima, Santa Cruz, Cochise, and Pinal Counties.
When asked about the impact of border security in migrant deaths Dr. Hess appeared rather neutral.
“Time will tell if this new push for border security will make a difference,” Hess responded. “Regardless of the administration in office, the deaths keep coming.”
Pima County Sheriff Mark Napier’s office is also impacted by the deaths of migrants and the subsequent recovery of their remains.
“Open borders policies are not compassionate public policy,” Sheriff Napier told OutletName Texas. “When we passively encourage illegal border crossing we are creating a human rights tragedy. These migrants are victimized repeatedly by bandits, human smuggling coyotes, and the harsh elements of this region.”
“Securing the border will prevent deaths and criminal victimization of border crossers,” Napier explained. “Securing the border is, in fact, compassionate public policy.”
Migrants deaths are not the only way that border crossers are victimized. “I hear from many sources that women expect to be sexually assaulted during the border crossing process,” the sheriff said. “They see it as part of the price they have to pay for admission.”
“We need to talk about border security in terms of not only national security but compassionate public policy,” Napier continued. “We should discuss ‘the wall’ as an analogous term referring to various aspects of border security that include manpower, physical barriers, technology, other resources.”

806,"Immigration hawks think that Democrats might support lowering legal immigration in return for a permanent amnesty for illegal aliens who arrived in the U.S. as minors, OutletName has learned.
The Trump administration has put its full force behind the RAISE Act, with both President Trump and his cabinet secretaries praising the legislation. The bill, which is sponsored by Republican senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue, aims to decrease legal immigration from around 1 million annually to roughly 500,000 a year.
Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, wrote in National Review that a way for the RAISE Act to get 60 votes in the Senate would be for it to include amnesty for the 800,000 or so beneficiaries of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).
DACA is the program started by President Obama in 2012 that protects illegal immigrants who arrived as minors from deportation and gives them work permits.
Ten Republican state attorneys general have threatened to sue the federal government if the program isn’t ended by September, and the Trump administration could refuse to defend the program much like the Obama administration did with the Defense of Marriage Act.
Krikorian went on WMAL Thursday morning and told OutletName’s Vince Coglianese, “Now there is a real possibility the plug will be pulled on that program [DACA] and so the Democrats are willing to trade a stable lawful amnesty to replace Obama’s illegal measure in exchange for the bill which was introduce yesterday.”
TheDC was also told by a source in a think tank that supports reducing immigration that he suspects that a form of legislative amnesty will be passed in return for passage of the RAISE Act.
President Trump promised to immediately terminate DACA while on the campaign trail, but has yet to do so. Roughly 100,000 illegal immigrants have benefited from the program in his first few months in office.
The White House has continued to say that the program’s future is under review.",0
760,"Several media outlets have published stories linking the migrant caravan to global warming.
Thousands of migrants from Central American countries, such as Honduras and Guatemala, are making their way through Mexico to the U.S. border to declare asylum.
Those in the media looking for a global warming angle to the story found experts who say the migrant caravan is a preview of the waves of “climate refugees” that will come with more global warming.
Media outlets want you to know the Central American migrant caravan heading to the U.S.-Mexico border isn’t just about fleeing poverty and violence, it’s also about global warming.
OutletName cited “experts” who “say the big picture is that changing climate is forcing farmers off their land – and it’s likely to get worse.” The OutletName said the migrant caravan “foreshadows” what’s to come with global warming.
Likewise, E&E News called the caravan a “preview of climate migrations” — that is people driven from their homes due to man-made global warming.
Thousands of migrants from Central American countries, such as Honduras and Guatemala, are making their way through Mexico to the U.S. border to declare asylum. Many of the migrants recounted horrific stories of organized crime, extreme poverty and lack of opportunity.
However, those in the media looking for a global warming angle to the story found experts who say the migrant caravan is a preview of the waves of “climate refugees” that will come with more global warming.
“It’s a future that’s rapidly arriving,” Frank Femia, co-founder of the Center for Climate and Security, told E&E News. Femia is also a major proponent of the theory that global warming helped spark the Syrian civil war. Proponents argue global warming exacerbated a multi-year drought that sparked the Arab Spring uprising in 2011, which eventually led to civil war.
It’s part of a larger theory that global warming can lead to violent conflict in vulnerable areas of the world. The Obama administration’s Defense Department even considered global warming a “threat multiplier.”
Conflict scholars have largely debunked many of the claims linking global warming to armed conflict and migration, but the media is trying to continue the narrative by linking global warming to Central American migrations.
For example, OutletName reported that “climate change in the region is exacerbating – and sometimes causing – a miasma of other problems including crop failures and poverty.”
“And they warn that in the coming decades, it is likely to push millions more people north towards the US,” the paper reported.
Like in Syria, supposed experts are pointing Central America’s struggle with recent droughts that caused thousands of acres worth of crops of maize and beans to fail. United Nations officials warned that millions are at risk of going hungry.
Central American officials claim global warming is part of the reason why their citizens are fleeing en mass, though.
“The impacts of climate change are part of the triggers of migration,” the Central American Commission for Environment and Development said in a statement released Thursday.
The recent droughts to hit Central America were driven by the incredibly strong El Nino that hit in 2015 and has persisted. El Nino, however, is a regularly-occurring natural phenomenon, not the product of human emissions.
And when it comes to droughts, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found “low confidence in a global-scale observed trend in drought or dryness (lack of rainfall) since the middle of the 20th century.”
OutletName also noted that federal data showed “a surge in outward migration from western Honduras, a prime coffee-producing area.” That’s because the collapse in coffee bean prices has made growing it less profitable, forcing migrants to hit the road.",0
344,"In a new biography by Keith Koffler, OutletName News Executive Chairman Stephen K. Bannon shares his reminiscences about Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, calling the tome one of his six most formative influences, and comparing America’s challenges to those to which our forebearers succumbed. “I’m not a multiculturalist,” Bannon relates in Bannon: Always the Rebel, explaining: America has “an underlying culture, that has been passed down from Jerusalem, to Athens, to Rome, to London. It’s the belief in self-reliance, it’s the belief in the self-determination of the individual. It’s freedom to be the traditional family. The culture that is our way of life. I think it’s absolutely vital and important. And we have an obligation to those that came before us as much as we have an obligation to the people in the future to pass that down.” The Romans, Bannon gleans from Gibbon, “[Are] the people most like us. … They built this great empire and how it all slipped away over time.” First published in six volumes between 1776 and 1789, the Englishman Gibbon’s work is a landmark of historical scholarship, setting the pattern for modern history writing. The Roman Empire was the greatest power the Western world had ever known, and its long shadow still cast noticeably over Gibbon’s enlightenment Europe. His flowery narrative of three centuries of decadence and decline that followed the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius featured prominently in the schooling of ten generations of school children and university students across the English-speaking world. Like much of the classical Western Canon, it began to fall out of favor in the latter twentieth century. Bannon, a devotee of the work, sees striking parallels in present-day America. Key to Gibbon’s depiction are the steady corrosion of the core virtues, and, while the term was still centuries from being coined, “social capital” of the Roman Empire by mass uncontrolled immigration, decadence among the elite, and the loss of cohesion around societal institutions with the rise of what Arnold Toynbee would describe – 140 years later – as the Empire’s “internal proletariat” of early Christianity. “You can see that power of Roman virtue, these Roman virtues of manliness, and service to the state. And that’s why everybody in the world wanted a part of that,” Bannon told Koffler of the state of affairs in Rome at its peak. That virtue, like the civic virtue of “melting pot”-era America, was enough to assimilate controlled immigration – the first waves of barbarians to the Roman citizenship 212 A.D.’s Edict of Caracalla granted them. But those barbarians came, in Gibbon’s view and Bannon’s, to overwhelm the capacity of the society to subsume them, like the unchecked mass of often-illegal third world immigration threatens to do to America today. And that “overrunning” of the Empire’s values at its frontiers was matched by the abandonment of them at its heart, among its elites. As Koffler relates of his conversation with Bannon: The Roman Senate “was bought and paid for by the elites. … The exact thing we face today!” he exclaimed. “What the Roman Empire faced is exactly what we face, that you lose the citizenship — and the power of citizenship — of the Roman Republic, you become an Empire, and that empire becomes a massive concentration of power and wealth, which is detached from the people. And then eventually, you’re having people who don’t want to serve in the legions, you have to go for foreign soldiers. Everybody is a mercenary. And therefore, no one really stood up or was prepared to die, really, in service to the country. And then what happened? Wave, after wave, after wave of migrations from the Goths, the Visigoths, the Huns. Coming into the empire and changing the culture and destroying the civic society they had in Rome. The empire could not withstand it.” According to the biography, other works of the Western Canon and Christian tradition from which Bannon draws inspiration for his worldview include Thomas à Kempis’s The Imitation of Christ, The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola, The Brotherhood of the Common Life and Its Influence by Ross Fuller, The History of the Peloponnesian War by Thucydides, and Plutarch’s Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans.",0
1042,"President Trump on Friday referred to the Flores Settlement as being decided on by “Judge Flores,” but the settlement was named after the plaintiff in the case, Jenny Lisette Flores, who fled El Salvador as a teenager.
“We’ve had some very bad court decisions. The Flores decision is a disaster, I have to tell you. Judge Flores, whoever you may be, that decision is a disaster for our country. A disaster. And we’re working on that,” Trump said during a roundtable near the southern border with border officials.
About the Flores Settlement: As OutletName has previously reported, the settlement was named after the 15-year-old girl from El Salvador. She fled her country in 1985 and tried to enter the United States to be with her aunt. The former government agency Immigration and Naturalization Service arrested her at the border, and she was placed in a juvenile detention center, where she was handcuffed and strip-searched, according to the Marquette Law Review. The INS refused to grant her aunt custody of Jenny because it wouldn't release minors to ""third-party adults,"" the law review article said. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action suit on behalf of the girl and other minors, eventually leading to the Flores settlement during the Clinton administration.
The Trump Justice Department has attempted to modify the 1997 agreement by asking for more time to detain children than the agreement allows and detain children with their parents in Immigration and Customs Enforcement residential facilities.

Pelosi then urged lawmakers to read the ""beautiful speech"" before quoting it.

She continued: ""Our common cause is to find and forge a way forward for our country. Let us stand for the people to promote liberty and justice for all as we pledge every day.

1672,"The wall rhyme appears to fit into that same bull’s-eye category. The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment about the origin of Mr. Trump’s latest catch phrase on Wednesday. But a senior aide to the president said that Mr. Trump came up with it himself, and credited the new slogan to his “marketing genius.”
There are a few hitches: Mr. Trump’s rhyming sales pitch that a border wall will reduce crime is not credible, and the facts he uses to bolster his claims are often correctable.
First, despite the president’s repeated claims, construction has not yet started on the border wall: The “under construction now” in his morning tweet needs more context. Customs and Border Protection has begun or completed several projects to replace old fencing with new barriers, but no additional miles of wall have been added yet. Construction to build a new levee wall system in Texas is scheduled to begin in February, the first extension of existing barriers.
Second, Mr. Trump’s rhyme that a wall will lead to falling crime rates may be catchy, but it’s at odds with what data shows about the influence immigration has on crime.
Law enforcement agencies rarely release crime data that includes immigration status, but several studies have found that immigration does not lead to an increase in crime. Others have shown that immigrants — including those who are undocumented — are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans.",1
819,"PolitiFact rated a claim that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S. born citizens as “Mostly True,” by merging illegal and legal immigrants into one group.
Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa claimed that “undocumented immigrants” commit fewer crimes than native-born citizens during a MSOutletName interview Monday. “That’s just a fact,” he said.
Politifact weighed in with a Thursday fact check: “We interpreted Villaraigosa’s statement to mean undocumented people commit crimes at a lower rate than the native born.”
One of the ways PolitiFact leads its audience to accept the “Mostly True” conclusion is by quickly switching from “undocumented immigrants” to simply “immigrants.” The fact check then uses studies regarding the crime rates of legal immigrants to argue that illegal immigrants commit less crime than U.S. citizens, a conflation that bears no strength in reality.
Attempting to establish a connection between legal immigrant’s crime rates and illegal immigrant crime rates is inaccurate and dishonest. A study from the National Academy of Sciences cited by Villaraigosa and analyzed by PolitiFact does not deal with illegal immigrant crime rates, but instead focuses on legal immigrants.
The fact check also cites a study from the American Immigration Council which does not “specify legal status” of the immigrants it analyzes. In an effort to demonstrate the crime rate of illegal immigrants compared to U.S. citizens, it seems pointless to again utilize data that includes said citizens with illegal immigrants.
To further support its rating, PolitiFact uses one of its fact checks from 2016 that also dealt with legal immigrants, a group Villaraigosa is not addressing. It is also worth noting that every illegal immigrant has already committed a crime, a fact for which the article fails to account.
The biggest problem with PolitiFact’s rating that “undocumented immigrants [are] less likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens” is “Mostly True” lies in the fact that we simply don’t have enough data on the issue — a point PolitiFact admits. “Researchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime,” the article notes.",0
1083,"A Border Patrol agent who was accused of intentionally knocking down a Guatemalan migrant with his government-issued vehicle in 2017 sent a text message to a colleague calling migrants ""mindless murdering savages,"" according to court documents.

1657,"In the odious 2018 film “Peppermint,” Jennifer Garner acts out a Trumpian fantasy. As a suburban mom whose husband and daughter were killed by Latino drug dealers, she becomes a one-woman vigilante army, killing a series of Latino assassins and destroying a piñata warehouse that doubles as a drug lord’s secret headquarters. The New Yorker called it “a racist film that reflects the current strain of anti-immigrant politics and its paranoid focus on MS-13.”
Like the drug dealers in “Peppermint,” the bad guys in Latino drug war films are often a mishmash of tropes and stereotypes. The cartel operatives in “SEAL Team” resemble an Islamic State army as they launch a Benghazi-style attack on the show’s heroes. The Americans take refuge in a Mexican church and summon other Navy SEALS to rescue them. The show aired not long after Mr. Trump sent troops to the Mexican border to stop a caravan of Central Americans.
Hollywood has become addicted to the narco narrative because it offers a tried-and-true tale of good and evil on an epic scale.
The new Netflix series “Narcos: Mexico” features an excellent, nuanced performance by Diego Luna as a smart, enterprising and deeply flawed man. But watching Mr. Luna build his “empire,” I longed to see a Latino actor play a big Hollywood role without seeing him leave the usual trail of cocaine and severed heads in his wake.
In “The Mule,” Mr. Eastwood plays an older man filled with regrets after a lifetime of alienating his wife and daughter. The drug dealers are really just stand-ins for forces that are eating away at many American families: rampant gun violence and the cruel logic of capitalism. The bad guys in narco films are always ruthless hyper-entrepreneurs, and in “The Mule” they tell Mr. Eastwood’s character, “We own your ass.” In “The Mule,” as in countless films of lesser quality, Latino stereotypes become symbols of a white man’s powerlessness and his unchecked desires. For his role in “Ozark,” Jason Bateman earned a Golden Globe nomination as yet another ordinary gringo caught up in the machinations of a Mexican cartel.
Meanwhile, in real life, Latinos are acting out their own human foibles, and trying to build their own private empires, in fields that don’t involve criminal activity. They manage your local Walmart, study law, get divorced, attend cosplay conventions, and do all sorts of things you rarely see them do in mainstream American television and film.
The dominant story among the more than 57 million Latino people in the United States is not the drug war: It’s inequality, immigrant ambition and the wounds caused by the separation of extended families. These themes await a treatment as virtuosic as “There Will Be Blood,” or as smart and cutting as “Get Out.”",1
1041,"A federal appeals court is allowing the Trump administration to continue returning some asylum seekers to Mexico for the duration of their immigration hearings, for now.
The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the administration can enforce the policy informally known as ""Remain in Mexico"" pending appeal. The judges, though split on some issues, list a number of factors that went into the decision, including risk of injury in Mexico and negotiations between the US and Mexico.
""The plaintiffs fear substantial injury upon return to Mexico, but the likelihood of harm is reduced somewhat by the Mexican government's commitment to honor its international law obligations and to grant humanitarian status and work permits to individuals returned"" under the policy, the opinion reads.
""We are hesitant to disturb this compromise amid ongoing diplomatic negotiations between the United States and Mexico because, as we have explained, the preliminary injunction (at least in its present form) is unlikely to be sustained on appeal.""
During oral arguments in late April , the three-judge panel -- made up of two judges appointed by Democratic presidents and one appointed by a Republican -- grappled with whether the policy should be allowed to continue, diving into technical matters and raising concerns about the process itself without providing much indication about where they stood on the policy overall.",1
458,"The U.S. government’s failure to establish border security is a moral failure and support for illegal immigration is “cruel,” President Donald Trump declared in his second State of the Union as the nearby Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, refused to clap.
The President’s focus on morality contrasts with the Democrats’ determination to persuade Americans that immigration curbs are merely forms of shameful racial discrimination. Trump built his moral case for border security and a border wall by first highlighting the criminal role of the drug and labor trafficking cartels:
Now is the time for Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business …
This is a moral issue. The lawless state of our Southern Border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws … Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.
This emphasis on morality shifts the focus from the poor migrants who try to get jobs in U.S workplaces towards the U.S. politicians who quietly endorse the mass migration.
Trump next spotlighted the Democrats’ support for easy-migration policies which transfer wages and opportunities from working-class Americans to older, wealthier investors:
No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools, hospitals that are so crowded that you can’t get in, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not clap as Trump slammed the immorality of her party’s welcome of migrants.
Trump pushed his moral argument even more by tacitly charging Democrats with cruelty for welcoming illegal migration:
Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery. Tens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities — including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. The savage gang, MS-13, now operates in at least 20 different American states, and they almost all come through our Southern Border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they’re going to keep streaming back in. Year after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. I’ve gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads and families — no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.
Trump then introduced three Americans whose elderly relatives were allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant:
Here tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra’s parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon’s granddaughter, Heather, and great-granddaughter Madison. To Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again. Not one more American life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.
Trump also spotlighted an immigrant Hispanic border security officer to undermine the Democrats’ attempt to portray border security as a racist campaign:
We are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: “If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I’ve done my job.” Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars.
Then Trump made his case for the border wall:
My administration has sent to Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our Southern Border. It includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. This is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way, way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime — one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our nation’s most dangerous cities. Now, immediately upon its building, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities. Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.
Trump rarely departed from the text of his speech. For example, he added the boldfaced text to this passage: “I want people to come into our country, in the largest numbers ever, but they have to come in legally.”
The establishment’s economic policy of using legal and illegal migration to boost economic growth shifts enormous wealth from young employees towards older investors by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor.
That annual flood of roughly one million legal immigrants — as well as visa workers and illegal immigrants — spikes profits and Wall Street values by shrinking salaries for 150 million blue-collar and white-collar employees and especially wages for the four million young Americans who join the labor force each year.
The cheap labor policy widens wealth gaps, reduces high tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high tech careers, and sidelines millions of marginalized Americans, including many who are now struggling with fentanyl addictions.
Immigration also steers investment and wealth away from towns in Heartland states because coastal investors can more easily hire and supervise the large immigrant populations who prefer to live in coastal cities. In turn, that coastal investment flow drives up coastal real estate prices and pushes poor U.S. Americans, including Latinos and blacks, out of prosperous cities such as Berkeley and Oakland, California.",0
1779,"In his 1960 book, “Presidential Power and the Modern Presidents,” the political scientist Richard Neustadt argued that presidential power is “the power to persuade.” Strong presidents have significant influence over public policy because they wield informal power, developing a reputation for getting their way and punishing those who impede their progress. Weak presidents — like Mr. Trump — fail to persuade, allowing competing political actors in Washington to block their goals and assert their own influence.
Mr. Neustadt identified a second resource that aids in presidential persuasion: public prestige. Political actors in Washington may not fear the president, but they may think twice about standing in his way if they perceive the public response to doing so may hurt them.
On this dimension, Mr. Trump appears to be stronger. His overall approval rating is very poor, but he is extremely popular among Republican voters. And his sizable conservative base is ready and willing to turn on elected Republicans in primary elections should they displease the president. The infrastructure of conservative media — OutletName, talk radio — strongly supports (and influences) Mr. Trump, augmenting this public power. Mr. Trump may not have much ability to sway Democrats, but Republican officials credibly fear crossing him.
Nevertheless, congressional Republicans have found a solution to this challenge: agenda-setting. Political power is not simply the ability to influence the positions citizens or lawmakers take on issues, but also the ability to control what issues are discussed and voted on.
Throughout the last Congress, Republican leaders simply declined to take up legislation that reflected the priority of the president but not their own. There were no votes on immigration restrictions or funding for a border wall, protectionist trade legislation or infrastructure.",1
387,"A sobbing Alyssa Milano shared a video with her 3.6 million Twitter followers in which she referred to the United States’ southern border as “arbitrary lines in the sand” and accused border patrol agents of “destroying children’s lives” by enforcing America’s immigration laws. “I just watched this video of a baby being reunited with her mom,” said Milano, as she sobbed in front of the camera. “What the fuck are we doing? We are destroying lives. We are destroying children’s lives because of fucking arbitrary lines in the sand.” “We can’t let this be the new normal. Besides what this country was founded on — this is not innately who we are as human beings,” continued the actress. “We’ve gotta take inventory of this, of what’s happening, and the humanitarian crisis at the border. We gotta do something. We can’t ignore what’s happening. We can’t allow it to continue.” “We must take inventory,” reiterated Milano during her snivelling rant. “We must do something, please. I’m going to post this video. I’m going to post it right now … please turn up the sound.” Milano — who last May called for a “sex strike” in an effort to boycott states that do not allow for women to terminate their pregnancies after their child’s heartbeat is detected — urged her followers to allow themselves “to feel” and “to have empathy” with regards to illegal immigration. “Please watch the whole video,” said the actress. “Please allow yourself to feel, to have empathy, and then I need you to get angry because this is being done in our names, with our taxpayer dollars. We can’t allow it to continue, please.” “Please,” begged Milano. “Please allow yourself to feel what’s happening.” ",0
708,"A coalition of 16 states led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a brief at the Supreme Court Tuesday, urging the justices to reinstate key provisions of President Donald Trump’s executive order on refugees and migrants.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) asked the high court to let the president’s order take effect last Friday, after the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court injunction barring enforcement of its travel ban provision. DOJ asked the Court to stay the lower court orders and schedule the case for oral arguments. The Court asked challengers to the travel ban to file a response to the government’s petition by June 12.
“The executive order is a tailored response to a very real threat to our national security,” Paxton said in a statement. “A temporary pause on entry from countries with heightened security concerns is necessary to shore up our nation’s vetting procedures. The president is fulfilling his solemn duty to protect Texans and all Americans.”
The states make three arguments: that the order deserves the strongest presumption of validity under relevant precedent; that the challengers cannot show the actual purpose of the order is to establish a discriminatory policy; and that the lower court injunction impermissibly extends constitutional rights to aliens abroad.
“This injunction is contrary to law, and it denies the federal government — under a statutory regime crafted by the representatives from the States in Congress — the latitude necessary to make national-security, foreign-affairs, and immigration policy judgments inherent in this country’s nature as a sovereign,” the brief reads.
Texas is joined on the amicus (or “friend-of-the-court”) brief by Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant.
Several other states, including Hawaii and Washington have been involved in litigation challenging the order.",0
974,"The toddler pounded her fists on the play mat, sobbing, with no parent to comfort her. Dr. Colleen Kraft watched from across the room, shaken by what she saw. “She was just inconsolable. … We all knew why she was crying,” says Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics. “She was crying because she wanted her mother, and there was nothing we could do.” Kraft had been invited by local pediatricians to visit a government shelter for immigrant children in Combes, Texas. The majority of the kids there, she says, had been separated from their parents. The heartbreaking scene was unlike anything she’d witnessed in her decades as a pediatrician. “I’ve never been in this situation where I’ve felt so needlessly helpless,” she told OutletName. “This is something that was inflicted on this child by the government, and really is nothing less than government-sanctioned child abuse.” Kraft visited the shelter – one of more than 100 in the country – this spring, shortly before administration officials announced that every person caught illegally crossing the border would be referred for prosecution, effectively making it an official policy to separate children from their parents. Administration officials have defended the approach, arguing they’re protecting children in custody and that separations of immigrant families at the border are no different than what happens when anyone accused of a crime is arrested. But since her visit, Kraft has been trying to convince them otherwise. She’s released statements condemning the practice of separating families, warning that children torn from their parents experience serious short- and long-term health consequences. The association she leads – which represents more than 65,000 members across the United States – has sent multiple letters to the Department of Homeland Security, calling for a change of course. The pediatricians’ group isn’t the only one that’s taken a stand. So have the American College of Physicians and the American Psychiatric Association. Together, the three organizations represent more than 250,000 doctors in the United States. “The effect of this type of event will follow these children into adulthood and into their entire lives,” Dr. Ana Maria Lopez, president of the American College of Physicians, told reporters Thursday. “Our federal government is causing a situation that is creating a host of potential health consequences for an entire category of people.” Kraft says there’s nothing political about the points she and other doctors are making. “This is injustice against the most vulnerable people on this planet: little children,” she says. “And we can’t stay silent.” ‘Toxic stress’
Kraft says separating children from their parents is likely to trigger what’s known as a “toxic stress” response. “Toxic stress is prolonged exposure to hormones such as cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine – fight or flight hormones – and then inflammatory hormones,” she says. “In a very young child, that disrupts brain development.” Possible results include developmental delays, such as problems with motor function or speech. And later in life, she says, kids that experience toxic stress are more likely to have health problems like heart disease, cancer and morbid obesity. “The younger the child is,” she says, “the more likely it is to really do long-term damage and short-term damage.” Children separated from their families at the border aren’t the only ones dealing with toxic stress, Kraft says. Pediatricians across the United States, she says, are sharing growing concerns about their patients as the administration continues its immigration crackdown. “It’s creating a whole generation of kids who are traumatized,” she says. After a separation
In the waiting room of Dr. Julie Linton’s office, a 2-year-old boy sat on the floor and refused to let go of his mother’s leg. “It was almost like he wouldn’t let her out of his sight,” says Linton, a pediatrician in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. His 5-year-old brother, meanwhile, was sitting quietly in a chair, his eyes glued to the ground. The two children had been separated from their mother at the border and had just been reunited after three months apart. Linton says the trauma they’d been through was clear. That was some two years ago, under the Obama administration, when the practice was less common. Now, Linton says, the situation is far more dire. “Now it’s a systematic policy to create the same kind of trauma that, before, I saw really on a case-by-case basis,” she says. “Now we’re systematizing something that we know is incredibly harmful and incredibly cruel.” Linton says she sees several trauma-related red flags in immigrant children experiencing toxic stress: • changes in body function: trouble sleeping, eating or toileting • changes in behavior: detachment, numbing or anxiety • changes in development and learning: memory, organization and tantrums that make it impossible to focus on new information And it’s not only happening at the border. Linton says she’s taken care of a number of children who’ve had a parent deported or taken into custody in front of them. “Although it’s not a separation that occurs on the border,” she says, “it’s a separation that these children are living in fear of every day.” ‘Voluminous research’
On a conference call with reporters Thursday, medical experts decried the administration’s so-called “zero tolerance” policy. “Voluminous research shows that parental separation is harmful to children,” said Arthur Evans Jr., CEO of the American Psychological Association. He pointed to a study indicating that parent-child separation increased symptoms of anxiety and depression in immigrant adolescents, and that children whose parents were detained in ICE raids exhibited multiple behavioral changes, including anxiety, frequent crying, changes in eating and sleeping patterns, withdrawal and anger. More recently, a Kaiser Family Foundation study found that growing fears in immigrant families are having significant negative effects on children’s health. Deportation fears
It’s something pediatricians across the country have noticed among their patients, Kraft says. “Families are scared. (Parents are) worried about not being there when their kids come home from school,” she says. “We have kids that are coming into the office with headaches and stomachaches to keep from going to school, because they’re afraid their parents are not going to be there when they get home.” Compounding the problem is immigrant parents’ growing distrust of authorities, according to Dr. Marisa Azaret, chief psychologist at Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami and a medical contributor for OutletName en Español. “Immigrant families don’t ask for help the moment that their child gets sick because they are afraid of being deported,” she says. “They don’t go to an emergency room because they are afraid. So the impact is long, chronic and toxic.” And growing fear isn’t just affecting children in immigrant families, Kraft says. It’s also affecting their friends. “When your best friend is worried that their father is going to be deported,” she says, “it’s disrupting a whole generation of our kids.”",1
824,"As the initial wave of Central American migrants traveling in a caravan streamed into Tijuana on Tuesday, many of them broke from the group and scaled the border fence just south of San Diego’s International Friendship Park.
Video taken by the San Diego Union-Tribune shows dozens of migrants climbing to the top of the barrier, where they waved and whistled at Border Patrol agents standing guard a few hundred feet away.
In a statement released Tuesday, the Border Patrol said it believes some of the people who climbed onto the fences are from the caravan of about 4,000 migrants that has been making its way north through Mexico for the past several weeks, FOX5 San Diego reported.
Tuesday’s scene near Friendship Park was reminiscent of what happened when a similar caravan of migrants arrived in Tijuana in April. In that instance, caravan migrants scrambled to the top of the border fence and waved the national flag of Honduras, the country many had fled just weeks before. The latest caravan has been the impetus for the Trump administration’s multi-pronged crackdown on illegal immigration in recent weeks. Characterizing the group as a potential “invasion” of U.S. territory, President Donald Trump ordered thousands of active duty troops to the southwest border and issued a proclamation making ineligible for asylum anyone caught crossing the border illegally.
Critics of the response have accused Trump of ginning up fear of the migrant caravan for political purposes. Others have questioned the necessity of using the U.S. military to guard against the migrants, most of whom are expected to crowd ports of entry in order to apply for asylum.
A few hundred of the caravan migrants who were able to board buses have already arrived in Tijuana, and the bulk of the group is expected to show up over the next few weeks. Officials in Baja California state, where Tijuana is the largest city, say local shelters can accommodate roughly 900 people as they wait for a chance to apply for asylum at a port of entry.
Meanwhile, thousands of migrants — mostly Central Americans like those traveling in the caravan — reach the U.S-Mexico border and attempt to slip across on a weekly basis.
In October, the number of migrants arrested trying to cross the southwest border illegally was about 51,000, or 1,700 per day. More than half of that number were people traveling in family units, according to Customs and Border Protection.",0
646,"The Trump administration recently narrowed the definition of sanctuary cities at risk of losing grants to noncompliance of a law that likely only a few jurisdictions don’t follow.
However, the budget proposal introduced by the White House Monday changes the definition of this law to make potentially over 100 jurisdictions at risk of losing grants.
Trump’s executive order stripping certain federal grants from sanctuary cities that was temporarily blocked by a federal judge pertained to a statute, 8 USC 1373, which doesn’t allow allow local officials to restrict information about an individual’s immigration status from the federal government.
However, conservative pundits and politicians frequently refer to sanctuary cities as jurisdictions that refuse to comply with immigration detainers. A document released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in March identified 118 jurisdictions that limit compliance with these detainers. The detainer requests ask agencies to hold individuals for up to 48 hours in order for ICE officers to pick them up or to let ICE know when the detainee is being released.
However, the number of jurisdictions in non-compliance with 8 USC 1373 is likely very small. The Department of Justice sent a letter to just nine jurisdictions in April asking them to confirm that they are in compliance. The DOJ held a meeting with lawyers that month to let them know that refusing to comply with detainers doesn’t put them at risk of losing funding. Liberal mayors rejoiced at this interpretation.
The Trump budget, however, redefines the law to include jurisdictions that don’t comply with an immigration detainer. This budget was introduced the same day that Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a memo saying that sanctuary cities aren’t those that refuse to comply with detainers in respect to Trump’s executive order. The liberal group America’s Progress pegged the move as a “sneak attack.”
The budget also requires agencies to share more than just the immigration status of an individual. It would now include the nationality, citizenship, immigration status, removability, scheduled date and time, home address, work address, or contact information of someone in custody or suspected of violating the law.
If Congress adopts the budget — which multiple Republican have called “dead on arrival” — sanctuary jurisdictions could lose DHS and DOJ grants. This provision about sanctuary cities would be a win for Trump’s hardline immigration agenda in a budget proposal that only funds 60 miles of new border walling and allocates money for the resettlement of 50,000 new refugees.
This reinterpretation could also be redundant if Congress passes the Davis-Oliver Act — a bill that introduces a similar definition of sanctuary city and also applies the same grant restrictions. This act gained the House Judiciary Committee’s approval Wednesday and the White House supports its passage.",0
803,"You may have read the news that there is a heated election recount taking place in Florida — again.
Eighteen years after the nation held its breath while a presidential election result was delayed for over a month, accusations of vote-counting improprieties are being hurled over contested Sunshine State races for senator, governor and agriculture commissioner.
Unlike the recount of 2000, this standoff has cast a spotlight on a very dangerous and existential threat to our democracy: non-citizen voting.
Though their side later denied it, it has been documented that lawyers for Florida Democratic gubernatorial and Senate candidates objected to the rejection of a provisional ballot cast by a non-citizen. To those who might say “big deal,” it’s actually a very big deal.
For the record, it is illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections. Federal law clearly states it here, here and here. Illegal immigrants found to have voted in federal elections are subject to fines, imprisonment and deportation, and are deemed ineligible to receive visas or allowed entry into the United States.
Isn’t this really about cold-hearted, nativist Americans being mean to foreigners? Hardly.
The integrity of our elections is one of the fundamental principles of our nation. Allowing non-citizens to vote devalues U.S. citizenship. It cancels out the votes of American-born and naturalized citizens and is an insult to those who lawfully participate in our elections.
Non-citizen voting also weakens American values.
What exactly does our country gain by allowing foreign nationals to decide who will lead us? Do those foreign nationals have any understanding of the founding principles that made America exceptional? Do they revere our uniquely American heritage that holds sacred the concepts of liberty, individualism and free speech? Probably not.
More than likely, they come from places where corruption, rigged elections and repression of basic human rights are accepted as the norm.
Without assimilation and taking the proper steps toward citizenship, those people are also vulnerable to the charms of unscrupulous politicians who dangle easy access to government handouts in exchange for ever-expanding government and the loss of individual freedoms. That path leads to a very bad place for the country, its citizens and its immigrants.
Not surprisingly, non-citizen voting is all the rage among those in America’s anti-borders movement. While the practice is illegal at the federal level, there are no such restrictions for elections at the local and state levels.
Many of the same places that gave us sanctuary cities and states are now seeking non-citizen voting rights. San Francisco has started the process, allowing non-citizens to vote in school board elections.
Boston is seriously considering the idea of allowing non-citizen voting in municipal elections. Given California’s zeal for all things illegal immigration — sanctuary laws, tipping off aliens before ICE operations, et al. how long will it be until illegal aliens have full voting rights in the Golden State? The smart money is on “not long at all.”
Other communities have employed a more devious, back-door approach to non-citizen voting. Take Chicago, which this year approved a new identification card for illegal aliens in the city.
“Undocumented workers” need an ID card for basic needs in the city, its supporters would argue. Then comes the twist: the ID cards will be accepted as a valid form of identification to register to vote, available to all Chicago residents regardless of immigration status or criminal record. Citizens of the world, you too can now determine who runs Chicago.
These cases and many more show how advocacy for non-citizen voting creates an opportunity for large-scale voter fraud. That’s why the Immigration Reform Law Institute has been relentless in its efforts to ensure integrity in our voting procedures.
Last year, for example, we filed an amicus curiae brief in the Supreme Court in support of a lower court decision in Fitzpatrick v. Sessions. The U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals had decided to expel from the United States a non-citizen who falsely stated that she was a U.S. citizen on a voter registration form and illegally voted in two elections.
If such flagrant violations of our election laws are not vigorously prosecuted, the damage to the integrity our republic will be incalculable.
What is currently taking place with the Florida recount is shameful. The presidential election recount in 2000 was decided by 537 votes. With each vote in states like Florida critical to the outcome, we can’t afford a single illegal vote.
Even in this increasingly polarized political climate, we should at least be able to expect our elections to be decided by U.S. citizens and no one else. Often, people fail to act on an issue because they feel it does not directly affect them. This is not one of those issues.
Demand voting integrity or live with destructive consequences.

652,"A multi-vehicle crash last week that claimed the life of the son of a Knoxville, Tennessee fire department captain was the result of a “chain reaction” begun by an illegal immigrant driving in the wrong lane, investigators said.
Pierce Kennedy Corcoran, 22, the son of Knoxville Fire Department spokesperson Captain D.J. Corcoran, was driving a Honda Civic south on Knoxville’s Chapman Highway the evening of December 30 when a Chevrolet pickup truck driven by Franco Cambrany Francisco-Eduardo reportedly veered into their lane and struck the vehicle.
Son of Knoxville Fire Captain dies in wreck, firefighters across the state come together to help
Corcoran was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel, and a passenger was treated but is expected to live. Both were wearing seat belts.
A Knoxville Police Department press release reported the accident to be the result of a “chain reaction crash” involving two other vehicles. No one was injured in the other vehicles involved.
44-year-old Franco Cambrany Francisco-Eduardo, an illegal immigrant, was arrested and charged with criminally negligent homicide as well as having no driver’s license or proof of financial responsibility, according to the News Sentinel, and was jailed without bond pending ICE action. Tennessee is not a sanctuary state.
The death of 22-year-old Pierce Corcoran has brought home to Knoxville the heated national debate over illegal immigration and the need for a border wall. 
On Friday, “Francisco-Eduardo was released from the Knox County Detention Facility into the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” the News Sentinel reported.
Tim Burchett, a newly-elected GOP representative who represents Tennessee’s 2nd congressional district, which covers Knoxville, called Corcoran’s death “tragic” and “entirely avoidable.”
“Based on the details released at this point, this situation underscores the need to fully enforce our existing immigration laws and strengthen and secure our border,” Burchett told the News Sentinel via email. “The bottom line is if the suspect hadn’t been in the country illegally, Pierce Corcoran would still be alive.”",0
1512,"In the public’s mind, the undocumented — the people living here without permission from the American government — are Hispanic, mostly Mexican and crossed the southwestern border in secret. In the eyes of their advocates, they are families and workers, taking the jobs nobody else wants, staying out of trouble, here only to earn their way to better, safer lives for themselves and their children. At the White House, they are pariahs, criminals who menace American neighborhoods, take American jobs, sap American resources and exploit American generosity: They are people who should be, and will be, expelled. Illegal immigrants can be many of these things, and more. Eleven million allows for considerable range, crosshatched with contradictions. There may be no more powerful symbol of how fixedly Americans associate illegal immigration with Mexico than the wall President Trump has proposed building along the southern border. But many of the unauthorized are not Mexican; almost a quarter are not even Hispanic. After Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, the largest number of unauthorized immigrants comes from China (an estimated 268,000), where deportations run aground on a less literal wall: China is one of 23 countries that do not cooperate with deportations. (The Trump administration has pledged to pressure all 23 into doing so.) They tend to be younger — the Pew Research Center has found that adult unauthorized immigrants were, at the median, about a decade younger than American-born adults — and skew slightly more male than the rest of the country. Geography and demography are only two ways to anatomize these 11 million. Circumstance offers another: As he seeks to tighten law enforcement’s grip on unauthorized immigrants, Mr. Trump will grapple with a population of people who arrived in several ways and for myriad reasons, each slice presenting its own challenges. Strong American Ties
A supporter of Jeanette Vizguerra, an undocumented immigrant who has spent 20 years working in the United States and has three American children, outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Denver on Feb. 15. Ryan David Brown for OutletName
To hear many liberals and immigrant advocates tell it, most undocumented immigrants are productive, law-abiding members of society, deeply rooted in communities all over the country, working hard, living quietly, paying taxes and raising families. Statistics show that many of the undocumented fit this profile. About 60 percent of the unauthorized population has been here for at least a decade, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. A third of undocumented immigrants 15 and older lives with at least one child who is a United States citizen by birth. Slightly more than 30 percent own homes. Only a tiny fraction has been convicted of felonies or serious misdemeanors. Of course, as the Trump administration has emphasized, merely being here without authorization is a violation of the law. Even the wording of the issue is revealing: conservatives favor the term ""illegal immigrants,"" which hardliners often truncate to ""illegals""; immigrant advocates prefer ""undocumented immigrants,"" a phrasing that they say prods the conversation back toward the humans in question, but that also has a whiff of euphemism. ""Unauthorized"" often shows up as a neutral alternative. No matter the label placed on them, people like Lydia, 47, who runs a small jewelry store in Los Angeles, do not think of themselves as lawbreakers. Lydia, who like several undocumented immigrants did not want her last name published for fear of being deported, crossed the border through Tijuana in 1988. She looked for legal help from a notary, mistakenly thinking that a “notario” indicates a legal expert, as it does in many Latin American countries. She was eventually ordered out of the country. But the Obama administration deprioritized deportations of people who had committed no major crimes, and it allowed her to live and work in the United States as long as she checked in with an immigration agent each year. Lydia raised four children, all citizens, and sent them to public schools in Sun Valley, a suburb north of Los Angeles. She and her husband bought a home there, paid off their mortgage and bought a second home nearby. Now she is a candidate for deportation once again, and is anxious each time she steps out of her home. “I am in limbo,” she said. “I am afraid I will go out and never come back.” Criminal Records
Few nemeses loomed larger in the narrative of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign than the figure of the illegal immigrant who threatened Americans — one of the “rapists” and “killers” from Mexico, as Mr. Trump has put it. Such people do exist. The Migration Policy Institute has estimated that 820,000 of the 11 million unauthorized have been convicted of a crime. About 300,000, or less than 3 percent of the 11 million undocumented, have committed felonies. (The proportion of felons in the overall population was an estimated 6 percent in 2010, according to a paper presented to the Population Association of America.) Immigration agents regularly arrest what the government calls “criminal aliens.” At the end of January, agents arrested a 50-year-old Mexican man near Milwaukee who had felony convictions for assault with a deadly weapon, battery against a police officer, car theft and intentionally harming a child, and who had been deported twice before. Last week, they caught an undocumented Honduran man in North Carolina, Francisco Escobar-Orellana, who is wanted in Honduras for allegedly hacking two men to death with a machete in 1993. The Trump administration has said it will continue to prioritize deporting those with serious criminal records, but, in a break from the Obama administration, the new policies also take aim at immigrants whose offenses are limited to living here without permission or minor crimes that enable immigrants to work here, like driving without a license or using a fake Social Security number. The Social Security Administration estimated that in 2010, 1.8 million undocumented immigrants worked under a number that did not match their name. Benjamin, 42, fixes the hydraulic trucks used for cane-cutting operations in Clewiston, Fla., often working 17 hours a day. Scott McIntyre for OutletName
Surrounded by the sugar cane fields of Clewiston, Fla., working backbreaking jobs, Maria and Benjamin took pains to follow the rules, pay taxes and stay out of the way. But now they fear the one rule Benjamin had to break to survive — he used a fraudulent Social Security number to secure a job — may prove their undoing. Benjamin, 42, fixes the hydraulic trucks used for the area’s cane-cutting operation, which means he works 17 hours a day, often at night. “This worries us, but we don’t have an option,” said Maria, 38, who arrived from Mexico when she was 19. “He has always worked and has always had a fake Social Security card. That is the way you get a job.” Overstayed Their Visas
Some people endure long journeys by foot, train, boat and smugglers to make it across the border. But for an increasing number of immigrants, illegal status arrives overnight, without a single step. Note: Data are estimates rounded to the nearest five thousand.
In each year from 2007 to 2014, more people joined the ranks of the illegal by remaining in the United States after their temporary visitor permits expired than by creeping across the Mexican border, according to a report by researchers at the Center for Migration Studies. A partial government estimate released last year said that 416,500 people whose business or tourist visas had expired in 2015 were still in the country in 2016. That does not count people who came here on student visas or temporary worker permits. Wei Lee and his parents came to San Francisco from Brazil on tourist visas in 2005. They remained after the visas expired. Elizabeth D. Herman for OutletName
Numbers like these have convinced some conservatives that the federal government needs to worry more about people who abuse their temporary legal status than about border security. In 2005, tourist visas brought Wei Lee and his parents to San Francisco from Brazil, where Mr. Lee’s parents, who had emigrated from China, ran a restaurant outside São Paulo. They remained in the United States after the visas expired. After being mugged and beaten in 2013, Mr. Lee recently received a U visa, which is reserved for victims of crime. His parents, however, are still undocumented. “Some people misunderstand, they think people come here and overstay their visas intentionally, but there are all these push and pull factors,” said Mr. Lee, 28, a college graduate who now works with Asian undocumented youth. “My parents had to make a decision for their lives.” After the expiration of the tourist visa that Rebeca, a former television reporter from Venezuela, used to enter the United States, she found work as a nanny, then got a job as a designer at a clothing business in Southern California. Rebeca, now 30, said she had left Venezuela after being attacked and receiving death threats for protesting against the government after the death of Hugo Chávez. She has applied for asylum, but it will be years before her case is even considered: In Los Angeles, immigration officials are currently scheduling hearings for people who first applied in 2011. One reason Mr. Trump and many proponents of curbing immigration see the Mexican border as alarmingly porous is that thousands of people each year are convicted of illegally re-entering the country after being previously deported. In the 2015 fiscal year alone, 15,715 were convicted, according to the United States Sentencing Commission. About a quarter of people caught crossing the southwest border that year had done it at least once before, according to a Government Accountability Office report. That said, the number of people convicted of illegal re-entry has declined by more than a quarter over the last five years. In December 2013, border security agents caught Clemente Armenta-Velasquez trying to return to the United States near Nogales, Ariz. After arriving in the United States in 2000, he had lived and worked in Arizona, where, records show, he was prosecuted on drug charges in 2002. He also served time in prison after being convicted of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, a felony, in 2010. He was deported the following year. Mr. Armenta-Velasquez’s lawyer told a federal judge that his client, who had left school after fifth grade, had tried to come back to support his wife and three children in Mexico. “He couldn’t find a job in Mexico that would give a decent life for his family,” said the lawyer, Ricardo Bours, according to court papers. Before sentencing Mr. Armenta-Velasquez to 57 months in prison, after which he will almost certainly be sent back to Mexico again, the judge suggested that Mr. Armenta-Velasquez might have been ordered deported as many as six times in the past. “I knew I wasn’t supposed to” return, Mr. Armenta-Velasquez said in court. “I did it out of great need, but I apologize for that.” Teresa Reyes, right, and her daughter, Abigail, live in North Carolina.

On Valentine’s Day, Rogelio Ortiz stopped by the local immigration office in Charlotte, N.C., to update his family’s address. He was seeking asylum in the United States after arriving from Honduras last February, fleeing arms traffickers who threatened him after he asked them to stop storing weapons in his brother’s house. Fifteen minutes later, an officer came out to tell Mr. Ortiz’s wife, Teresa, and daughter, Abigail, that he had been detained. Without realizing it, Mr. Ortiz, 49, had already lost his asylum case: He had been deported 14 years ago after a previous stint working in the United States, and was ineligible. Since 2009, migrants seeking asylum from Mexico and Central America’s Northern Triangle region — Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala — have surged across the border at a relentless pace, fleeing gang violence and poverty. Many of them are children traveling alone or women with children. Nearly 409,000 migrants were caught trying to cross the United States’ southwestern border illegally in the 2016 fiscal year, an increase of 23 percent over the previous year, according to government statistics. Many ask for asylum, but in most cases, the requests are denied. While they wait, a process that can take years to conclude, they are often released to move freely into the country. That can mean disappearing beyond the reach of immigration officials. The system has infuriated those who advocate tougher enforcement, prompting the Trump administration to propose detaining asylum seekers at the border or forcing them to wait it out in Mexico. “I know coming into the country illegally is a crime, but millions of people have done it, and now we come here asking for help,” Teresa said. Now she seeks work to pay for a plane ticket. Teresa plans to renounce her own asylum claims to reunite, once again, with her husband — this time, back in Honduras.",1
1184,"President Donald Trump's executive orders on immigration include plans to build a border wall, deport more people and crack down on sanctuary cities .
A temporary ban on incoming refugees and a halt to visas for immigrants from certain countries could also be in the offing
The measures unveiled this week provide the most detailed information we've seen so far about Trump's overhaul of the US immigration system. But there are many unanswered questions about how things will play out.
Here are seven key questions we're asking:
1. How much will it cost?
That's the more-than-$10-billion question. Trump has used that price tag to estimate how much building a wall on the US-Mexico border would cost. And the wall is only the beginning.
Another possible big-ticket item: plans to build more detention centers.
2. Where will the money come from?
As the OutletName pointed out in a story on Wednesday, no matter what Trump prioritizes, Congress has the checkbook
The President does have some leeway to shift funds between departments, but money for major initiatives will need to come from lawmakers.
Even if Congress has to foot the bill up front, Trump has vowed to make Mexico pay for the border wall eventually -- something Mexican officials say they'll never do . The latest possibility floated by administration officials: imposing a 20% tax on imports from Mexico to pay for the border wall.
3. What happens to the Dreamers?
On the campaign trail, Trump touted his plans to dismantle his predecessor's crowning immigration achievement: the program that prevented about 750,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children from being deported. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program helps the so-called Dreamers get driver's licenses, enroll in colleges and secure jobs.
And there's little doubt that it will end up on the chopping block.
But so far, Trump's administration is still accepting applications for the program.
4. How will this impact sanctuary cities?
One of Trump's executive orders says the federal government will cut funding to cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration officials.
That means federal grants that provide millions of dollars to local governments could be at stake.
These so-called sanctuary cities say they're committed to protecting their undocumented residents from possible deportation, and they're banding together as they brace for what's likely to be a contentious legal battle.
Already New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he's ready to go to court over the issue, and it's likely others will follow suit.
5. When will we start to see these changes happening?
It's unlikely many significant changes in the way the US handles immigration will happen overnight.
But even a small memo outlining priorities can have a big impact on how individual cases are handled. We saw that in 2014, when the Obama administration issued new guidelines that shifted enforcement efforts to focus on recent border-crossers and criminals who posed a threat to public safety. That change meant some cases were dropped altogether, while others were scheduled for court dates several years in the future.
Trump's executive orders would crack down more severely on immigrants accused of criminal offenses, and could signal that cases that might have been dropped before will now become a priority.
6. And how long will they take?
Just because something shows up in an executive order doesn't mean it will become reality.
President Obama tried a similar approach in 2014 to expand the DACA program and create a new program to help the Dreamers' parents.
Those programs faced swift legal challenges and were tied up in the courts for years before the Supreme Court deadlocked over whether they were constitutional, effectively killing the measures that would have helped more than 4 million undocumented immigrants come out of the shadows.
7. Will these measures impact people who aren't undocumented immigrants or refugees?
In all likelihood, yes. But exactly how remains unclear.
The details of the policy haven't been officially announced, and it's unclear how it would apply to immigrants from those countries who have already obtained visas to be in the United States to study or work.
It's also unclear how immigration authorities will approach Trump's intensified focus on deporting criminals. But it's possible that green card holders and other legal residents could end up in deportation proceedings if they have any charges on their records.",1
1023,"Chuck Schumer arrived for his first day as Senate Democratic leader to a large, new Capitol suite still strewn with unpacked boxes.
""It's a little fancier than I'm used to, but it goes with the territory,"" Schumer told us, as he sat down for his maiden television interview as the Senate's top Democrat.
Schumer was hoping to be the new Democratic Senate majority leader, working with Hillary Clinton in the White House. Instead, he is leading the Trump opposition. The former would have been more fun, he conceded, but he says being minority leader now is ""more important.""
Here's how he described a recent phone conversation with Donald Trump: ""I said, 'Mr. President-elect, you went after both the Democratic and Republican establishments when you ran; you were an anti-establishment change candidate. But by your Cabinet picks and your early pronouncements, you seem to be embracing your timeworn, shop-worn hard right,'"" he recalled.
""If you do that, your presidency will not come close to being a success,"" he told Trump.
For Schumer, success will be even more complicated. He has to walk a very fine line between when to work with Trump, and when to oppose him. Schumer describes it as ""accountability.""
""The only way we're going to work with him is if he moves completely in our direction and abandons his Republican colleagues,"" Schumer said.
""90-95% of the time, we'll be holding his feet to the fire, holding him accountable. But we're Democrats, we're not going to just oppose things to oppose them,"" he added.
Schumer started his congressional career in the House in 1981, and served there until successfully defeating longtime Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998.
He climbed the Democratic ranks as a fierce partisan and prolific fundraiser, but in recent years turned his attention to also becoming a successful legislator who can work across the aisle. He played a key role in crafting bipartisan Senate immigration reform in 2013, though the bill stalled in the House and never became law.
Schumer loves being the center of deal making, a lot like the incoming president.
""Well, here's the problem. The Republicans in the Senate and the House have been run by a hard right group,"" said Schumer.
But what about now that they have a dealmaker in the White House?
""Look, we're going to look at the specifics,"" Schumer said. ""And on the overwhelming bunch of it, particularly given who he's chosen as his Cabinet people, we're going to have to oppose him because we just disagree in principle.""
""Of course I'd like to make a deal,"" he added.
Many progressives scoff at the notion of Schumer even considering any form of compromise with Trump.
Democracy for America, a leading progressive group, said: ""Democratic leaders from Chuck Schumer down need to stop playing footsie with Trump and pretending we can find.""
Schumer's response: ""We're playing no footsie. My views are exactly the same as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.""
""If we can work with him and be true to our principles, we're not going to reject him. But overall, we're sticking to our principles,"" he said.
The two New Yorkers have a history. Schumer says he doesn't know Trump well, but he was one Schumer's of early political donors. Schumer confirmed New York Post reporting that the President-elect told him he likes him better than GOP leaders.
The new Democratic leader said he wasn't surprised, but also not flattered.
""When you get to be in my position, people do tend to want to flatter you and you've got to take it with a grain of salt,"" he said.
Trump is hardly Schumer's only concern. He's also going to be the de facto leader of the movement to fix the defeated Democratic Party.
""What we have to do is look at this election in the eye and see what we did wrong. I think we know what we did wrong. We have always been a party with a sharp-edged economic message that talks about helping the middle class and people who want to get to the middle class get there more easily. We didn't have that in this election,"" Schumer said. ""So that even though Trump's positions were much further away from where the middle class is and what they want, he seemed to be the person talking to them.""
The New York Democrat says he will help his party craft what he calls a ""focused and sharp-edged message.""
""And here's the good news. Some people say, 'Which direction do you go in? The old Obama coalition or the new blue collar?' If we have a sharp-edged economic message, it unites our party. It unites Joe Manchin (a West Virginia moderate) to Bernie Sanders (a Vermont liberal), both of whom are on my leadership team,"" Schumer said.
""It unites the blue-collar worker in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the college student paying her loans in Los Angeles, the single mom in Harlem who's on minimum wage,"" he said, seeming to take the message for a test-drive.
It may be just the task for the man who put himself on the political map in the1980s by being media savvy. It was then that he realized that Sundays were a great day to make news (especially the OutletName), so he started holding regular Sunday news conferences.
In the 1990s, one of the running jokes in Washington was that the most dangerous place in to be in the District was between Schumer and a television camera (Schumer says it was originally former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's line after Schumer used his publicity prowess to push through the Brady gun law).
But that's no longer true. Over the past several years, Schumer has tried to be more disciplined. He's more likely to either be on his cell phone in the Capitol hallways, or pretend to be, in order to avoid talking to reporters
""In the early days, the press was a very good way to bring out problems that needed to be fixed. Now, I have other levers of power, so I'm hardly inaccessible. And you can say a lot of bad things about Chuck Schumer and accessibility is never going to be one of them,"" Schumer said with a knowing laugh.
The same goes for authenticity. Though he proudly declared that he bought a new suit for his first day as leader, he is clearly still the same rumpled guy who slept for 30-plus years on a mattress next to the kitchen in a rundown group house owned by former Rep. George Miller.
He now lives in an apartment, which is why he told us he is excited to have a large balcony outside his Capitol office.
""We're going to try to find out if we can have barbeques,"" Schumer said with genuine excitement.
After a few more minutes, the New Yorker told us he had to get back to work. After all, he laughed, he can't spend all his time doing press.",1
401,"The Pentagon is preparing in case President Donald Trump orders the military to build the southern wall, according to a defense official.
Trump has hinted in recent days that he may do so, amidst an impasse in negotiations with Democrats that has shut down the government.
“I may declare a national emergency dependent on what’s going to happen over the next few days,” Trump told reporters on Sunday.
While no order has been given, the Pentagon has been making plans just in case such an order comes down, the official said on Monday.
The idea of declaring a national emergency to have the military build the wall has been considered since fall, the official revealed.
Some money could come from unobligated funds for military construction projects in 2019, the official said. “Unobligated” means that the funds have been authorized for a certain purpose, but for whatever reason, have not yet been used.
The Army Corps of Engineers would likely be in charge of overseeing the construction.
The organization would not build the wall itself, but would subcontract the project out, and then inspect it to make sure it meets specification and Defense Department standards.
While most Democrats have claimed Trump did not have the authority to order the military to build the wall, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Adam Smith (D-WA) acknowledged Sunday that the president does have the authority.
“There is a provision in law that says the president can declare an emergency. It’s been done a number of times. But primarily it’s been done to build facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq,” he said Sunday on OutletName’s “This Week.”
A Pentagon spokesman told reporters in December in response to queries: “Congress has provided options under Title 10 U.S. Code that could permit the Department of Defense to fund border barrier projects, such as in support of counter drug operations or national emergencies.”
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan is unlikely to oppose any such order for the military to build the wall.
After a Cabinet meeting last week on the border, he praised the Army Corps of Engineers for its work so far in restoring fences and the “building out of additional mileage for the wall.”
“The Army Corps of Engineers is dialed in on doing this cost-effectively, quickly, and with the right amount of urgency as to where we can build additional standup walls quickly and then get after the threat. The threat is real. The risks are real. We need to control our borders,” he said.
But Smith and a number of other Democrats say they are opposed to the idea, and that Trump would be open to legal challenges.
“In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, where is the emergency? You have to establish that in order to do this. But beyond that, this would be a terrible use of Department of Defense dollars.”
The president is slated to give a nationwide Oval Office address on Tuesday evening on the border situation, and is expected to travel to the border on Thursday.
Defense officials say they will be monitoring to see if a declaration of national emergency comes during those events this week.
Separately, the Department is slated to announce an extension of troops serving at the border by the end of this week.
Military support to the border was extended through January 31 by former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and it is expected to be extended again.
There are approximately 5,000 who are helping border patrol agents secure the border. Trump ordered the deployment ahead of at least two migrant caravans that were headed to the United States from Central America.",0
600,"President Donald Trump will offer another compromise deal on Saturday to end the shutdown over the border wall, and Democrats will approve $1.1 billion to buy extra surveillance technology and additional immigration judges, according to Friday evening media reports.
OutletName reported:
A senior administration official told OutletName News Chief Washington Correspondent Major Garrett that Mr. Trump will present what the White House believes could be a deal to end the shutdown. The deal was largely influenced by talks between Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.
Kushner and Pence met with McConnell in the Senate Majority Leader’s office on Thursday evening.
The proposal will be made via a 3:00 p.m. presidential announcement from the White House.
OutletName reported that the Democratic proposal would not add any money for the border fence, despite Trump’s repeated push for $5.7 billion or his compromise offer of $2.5 billion. Trump’s request for $5.7 billion in 2019 would buy an extra 234 miles of border fence on the 2,000-mile border.
WASHINGTON — House Democrats have added more than $1 billion in border-related spending to a package of funding bills that would reopen most of the government … … About half the money, $524 million, would be for additional infrastructure at ports of entry on the border, one Democrat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the plans have not been formally announced, while $563 million more would be inserted to fund 75 immigration judges, who adjudicate the claims of migrants who make asylum claims at the border.
Trump posted two Tweets on Friday night, including a hinted description of the proposed compromise:
I will be making a major announcement concerning the Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border, and the Shutdown, tomorrow afternoon at 3 P.M., live from the . — Donald J. Trump () January 18, 2019
Trump said:
Everything we are asking for, whether it is the wall or barrier, whether it is the technology, whether it is the drug-detecting equipment, this is what law enforcement wants, this is what they need. Wait until you see the results. They’ll be proud of it and we’ll be even prouder.
On January 9, Kushner and Pence met with a group of business-first GOP Senators, led by Sen. Lindsey Graham. The GOP Senators urged the White House to swap an amnesty for perhaps three million “DACA” illegals in exchange for a few billion dollars for the border wall.
Media reports on the proposal did not say the Senators backed Trump’s call for vital reforms to block the migration of poor Central Americans into the United States via the multiple catch-and-release rules in border law.
Since January 9, Graham has repeatedly urged Trump to give up his wage-boosting “Hire American” policy to get wall funding.
Lindsey 'Gang of Eight' Graham says he will support border-wall emergency if Trump spends 3 weeks offering DACA amnesty & TPS giveaway to Dems & business. IOW, wants Trump to trade his 'Hire American' policy to get a symbolic wall w/o vital asylum reforms ://t.co/in1VRRrc2f — Neil Munro () January 14, 2019
The January 10 reports did say the Senators also want to include an expansion of the H-2B visa program which allows U.S. landscapers, restaurants, fish processors,and forestry companies to import cheap workers and so reduce wages for their American employees.
In the zig-zag talks, Trump has already given several concessions to the Democrats, who have not offered anything in exchange.
OutletName‘ report about an extra $1.1 billion in border security spending is a minor concession. The public — and nearly all legislators — strongly support the deployment of drug-detection technology.
Democrats pocket Trump's several concesssions in the border wall/shutdown talks, and continue to describe the wage-cutting economic migrants as refugees who deserve humanitarian aid. Q: Can the Dem. leaders enforce a compromise in the 'diversity party'? ://t.co/cf9Qnr0tzf — Neil Munro () January 10, 2019
Democrats hate Trump’s border wall because they see it as a symbolic public rejection of their plans to impose greater diversity on Americans. The wall is “an immorality,” according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It “is not who we are as a nation,” she said January 3.
Via Twitter, pro-migrant activists shared their worries about the nature of Trump’s offers, which follow several prior concessions by Trump, including a decision to build a fence of steel slats instead of the proposed concrete wall, which is loathed by pro-migration Democrats.
Lol this appears to be as dumb as it looks. This is almost certainly going to be s grand bargain in which Trump offers softer beds for separated child detainees in exchange for a wall. Mitch, Pence and Jared. Lol ://t.co/bHjh8Pyo2p — Josh Marshall () January 19, 2019

1946,"Celebrity chef José Andrés, famous for providing free meals to disaster victims, attended President Donald Trump’s State of the Union speech on Tuesday ― and made a point of silently advocating for immigrants through his outfit.
The world-renowned chef, invited by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), reportedly wore a shirt that read “Immigrants feed America.” Ahead of Trump’s speech, Andrés also tweeted his own thoughts about the state of the union, calling for “longer tables, not higher walls!”
“In Tijuana, we met people seeking nothing more than a better future for their families,” the chef wrote, referring to his nonprofit World Central Kitchen’s initiative to serve free meals to migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border late last year. “We saw that common sense solutions to immigration will lead to safer, stronger communities at home and abroad.”

Meanwhile in his speech Tuesday, Trump repeatedly railed against “illegal immigration.”
“Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business,” Trump said in his prepared remarks. “Working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration … Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate ― it is cruel.”
Chef Jose Andres gives House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a tour of one of the kitchens of World Central Kitchen, his nonprofit, which served meals to those affected by the government shutdown in Washington on Jan. 22, 2019.
Last month, Andrés’ nonprofit also served free meals to U.S. federal workers who were affected by the partial government shutdown and struggling to get by without pay.
Trump’s speech, originally planned for Jan. 29, was delayed after Pelosi asked him to postpone it until the shutdown ended. During the record-breaking, weeks-long shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal workers were furloughed or worked without pay, as Trump refused to budge on his demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border ― which Democratic lawmakers firmly opposed.
On Jan. 25, Trump announced a plan to reopen the government for three weeks ― but if he doesn’t get funding for his border wall by the end of the negotiation period on Feb. 15, Trump has said he is prepared to shut down the government again.
At the State of the Union Tuesday, several Democratic lawmakers invited formerly furloughed federal workers as their guests, including 2020 presidential contender Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).
Ahead of the State of the Union, Andrés told the Washingtonian he was attending “on behalf of the 11 million who are waiting to be a part of the American dream, on behalf of the Dreamers, on behalf of those children who are separated from their parents without any logical explanation.”
The chef has long spoken out on behalf of immigrants, particularly amid Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric and his administration’s crackdown on undocumented immigrants. At an event in 2017, the chef gave a speech wearing a shirt that read “I Am An Immigrant” and made a moving plea for all hardworking immigrants ― regardless of status.",1
1547,"Most Americans oppose the separation of immigrant families at the border, and a larger share of people than at any point since 2001 say immigration is good for the nation. Those were just some of the findings of polls published in the past week that shed new light on attitudes toward immigration, a subject that many Americans view as a top concern ahead of this fall’s midterm elections. While most oppose President Trump’s policy of separating children from their parents at the border, fellow Republicans were more likely to support it than not, the polls found. Since the polls were conducted, however, the president caved to public pressure and agreed to stop the separation policy by detaining families at the border together for an indefinite period. And despite the president’s anti-immigration message, three in four Americans say immigration is generally good for the nation, according to Gallup, the polling organization. “Americans’ strong belief that immigration is a good thing for the country and that immigration levels shouldn’t be decreased present the president and Congress with some tough decisions as the midterm elections loom,” Gallup said in a news release Thursday. Record support for immigration Despite the contentious political climate, 75 percent of Americans think immigration, in general, is good for the nation, according to Gallup, which surveyed more than 1,500 adults during the first two weeks of June. Among Democrats and those who lean toward the party, 85 percent viewed immigration positively, compared with 65 percent of Republicans and those who lean Republican. When asked their thoughts about “legal immigration” specifically, even more Americans, about 84 percent, said it was good for the country. Support for reining in immigration is at its lowest level in more than half a century: Just 29 percent of Americans believe it should be decreased, the smallest share recorded by Gallup since at least 1965. Strong opposition to separating families Several recent polls found that most Americans disagreed with President Trump taking a hard-line approach to immigration enforcement by separating families at the border. “When does public opinion become a demand that politicians just can’t ignore?” Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement this week, announcing the results of a recent survey of more than 900 voters conducted last week and weekend. “Two-thirds of American voters oppose the family separation policy at our borders.” Two similar polls of adults — one conducted by Ipsos and another conducted by YouGov with The Economist — found comparable results, albeit with smaller majorities opposing the policy. In all three polls, those surveyed were about twice as likely to oppose separating families as to support it. But there was a large partisan divide: Republicans were more likely to support family separation than oppose it, while Democrats overwhelmingly disliked it. Independents strongly opposed the policy, just not to the same degree as Democrats. “Neither quotes from the Bible nor get-tough talk can soften the images of crying children nor reverse the pain so many Americans feel,” Mr. Malloy said in the statement. The administration was heavily criticized after Attorney General Jeff Sessions used a Bible passage to justify the separation policy and images of weeping children began to circulate widely. The nation’s top problem?
Immigration has also emerged as a top policy concern among Americans: Those who were asked this month to name the most important problem facing the nation were more likely to bring up the issue than any other, according to a Pew Research Center survey of about 2,000 adults. When Pew asked that same question in January 2017, immigration was cited less often than health care, the economy, unemployment, race relations and Donald J. Trump, then the president-elect. Gallup found similar results: The share of Americans who said immigration was the top problem facing the country rose to 14 percent in June, from 10 percent the month before. Both polls found that Republicans cited immigration far more often than Democrats. Still, Pew found that about one in five Democrats and Republicans alike wanted local candidates to discuss the issue this fall.",1
2072,"The drama and acrimony in the Senate over the past week may be hampering the chances of contacts with extraterrestrial life, Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said jokingly on Wednesday.
Kennedy expressed dismay about the bad blood and finger-pointing among his colleagues, who feuded in recent days about an infamous White House meeting on immigration last week with President Donald Trump. The ensuing fallout from the session ― in which the president reportedly referred to Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries” and said that instead of immigrants from those areas, he would like more from places like Norway ― has resulted in several African nations summoning U.S. diplomats to protest Trump’s comments.
Several of the meeting participants ― Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and David Perdue (R-Ga.) ― have been engaged in a war of words over what the president exactly said about certain countries. Cotton and Perdue went so far as to question the credibility of Durbin, who confirmed Trump’s “shithole” remark.
The spectacle was too much for Kennedy, a freshman who already has made a name for himself on Capitol Hill by frequently opining on events of the day with folksy and witty one-liners. In his Wednesday comments, he compared the Senate’s recent nastiness to the notoriously sensational daytime television program “The Jerry Springer Show,” and facetiously posited that it was impairing intergalactic relations.
“That’s why the aliens won’t talk to us,” Kennedy told reporters. “They look at all of this stuff, and they go, ‘These people ― they’re 13-year-olds.’”
He continued: “I’m talking about private meetings, so-and-so said this, and no, he didn’t say that, and you’re a liar. The whole junior high cafeteria syndrome.”
He added: “You know ― here’s a newsflash to you: Sometimes, people swear, okay?”
Kennedy said the discord among his colleagues was hindering talks to fund the government and avoid a shutdown of agencies at the end of this week.",1
226,"Top defense officials toured sections of the U.S.-Mexico border Saturday to analyze if reinforcement efforts are needed to block drug smuggling and other illegal activity, as the Pentagon weighs diverting billions of dollars for President Trump's border wall.
TRUMP PLANS TO ALLOCATE $8B TO BORDER WALL: SOURCE
Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, accompanied by the Joint Chiefs chairman, Gen. Joseph Dunford, was visiting a border site near El Paso, Texas, called Monument Site 3.
Shanahan and Dunford got an up-close look at U.S. Border Patrol vehicles used for surveillance. The Department of Homeland Security has requested Pentagon help in operating about 150 of the vehicle-mounted surveillance cameras, which can see as far as eight miles away.
Shanahan also tried his hand at firing a couple of Border Patrol weapons, including one that uses plastic bullets.
Later, the officials planned to fly over two border control sites farther west. These sites are on a list of high-priority projects DHS submitted to Shanahan on Friday to support its request for money to pay for construction of roads, replacement of vehicle barriers and dilapidated pedestrian fencing, and installation of lighting. The pedestrian fencing would include detection systems that could alert border patrol agents when someone is attempting to damage or break through the fencing. The money would come from the Pentagon's drug interdiction programs.
One such project proposed by DHS, dubbed ""El Paso Project 1,"" includes segments of border west of El Paso, in Luna and Dona Ana counties, New Mexico. This is among areas DHS cites as known drug smuggling corridors used by Mexican cartels. Shanahan and Dunford were to fly over this site in a V-22 Osprey aircraft to get an aerial view of the site and to see where DHS resources are inadequate.
These projects are separate from, but related to, those which Shanahan is expected to pay for by diverting money that Congress appropriated for military construction projects. This could total as much as $3.6 billion, although Shanahan has not yet determined that the diversion is justified. His visit Saturday was meant to help him decide whether to approve such spending.
DHS has yet to provide the details that Shanahan says he needs before making his decision on the repurposing of military construction funds. He has said he is likely to provide the full $3.6 billion the White House is expecting, plus $2.5 billion from the drug interdiction program. Trump authorized the use of these military funds when he declared a national emergency to build a wall.
Wall construction would be done under contracts managed by the Army Corps of Engineers, whose commander, Lt. Gen. Todd Semonite, accompanied Shanahan on Saturday. The Corps has built 126 miles (203 kilometers) of border wall in the last two years — mostly replacement barriers, Semonite told reporters.
Democrats in Congress, meanwhile, are seeking to block Trump's emergency declaration to stop the diversion of Pentagon funds for his border wall. The House is to vote Tuesday on a resolution to block Trump.
There are about 2,900 active-duty troops and about 2,100 National Guard troops on the border in support of Customs and Border Protection. That combined total of 5,000 is expected to grow to 6,000 by March 1 as the Pentagon provides additional support.
The border mission for active-duty forces began on Oct. 30, 2018 and has since been extended to Sept. 30.

336,"Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents rescued a Honduran migrant after he nearly died from dehydration after illegally crossing the Rio Grande. Agents assigned to the Eagle Pass South Station began tracking a group of illegal immigrants who crossed from Mexico into Texas on June 6. The agents eventually came upon a 24-year-old man lying on the ground. The agents determined the man to be suffering from dehydration and immediately summoned Border Search, Trauma, and Rescue (BORSTAR) agents who were working nearby, according to information obtained from Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials. The BORSTAR agents arrived on the scene and immediately began treating the man for heat-related injuries. The BORSTAR agents stabilized the man who would have likely died had the agents not found him. The agents litter-carried the man for a quarter-mile through the brush where they met up with a local ambulance. The ambulance crew transported the man, identified as a Honduran national with no legal authorization to be in the U.S., to a nearby hospital for “more advanced treatment.” “The majority of people attempting to illegally enter this country are ill-prepared for the treacherous terrain they face,” Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul L. Ortiz said in a written statement. “Had our agents not been out patrolling the remote areas of our border, this man would have most likely died from exposure.” U.S. Border Patrol Chief of Law Enforcement Operations Brian Hastings told reporters during a press call on Wednesday that the number of rescues of migrants is increasing dramatically this year. “So far this fiscal year, the men and women of the Border Patrol have done over 3,000 rescues,” Hastings told the reporters. “We’ve seen a massive increase in the amount of water-related rescues that are taking place — primarily in Del Rio, RGV, and Laredo’s areas of operation.” “Water-related rescues alone have gone up 907 percent this fiscal year,” the chief explained. “They’ve (the rescues) have gone from 51 in Fiscal Year 18 to 514 during Fiscal Year 19. That means, a lot of times, risking their lives to save the lives of others.”",0
468,"The Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler fired off a “fact check” during President Donald Trump’s State of the Union speech, parsing whether migrant women were “sexually abused” or “assaulted” while traveling through Mexico to the United States with human traffickers.
In his remarks, the president appeared to cite a May 2017 report via Doctors Without Borders, which says: “1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north.”
“Tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate –it is cruel,” Trump began. “One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.”
“Human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery,” he continued.

127,"President Trump has called for congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday, top Republicans said shortly after a hotly anticipated, contentious closed-door meeting on border security in the Situation Room concluded Wednesday afternoon.
The sit-down apparently ended without any progress made in resolving the ongoing partial federal government shutdown that has persisted for 12 days, and one senior GOP official said Democrats didn't seem interested in listening to what Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had to say.
A source inside the Situation Room told OutletName that it was the consensus of all participants that House Democrats would be able to negotiate once House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is elected speaker of the House on Thursday, as expected.
A White House official separately told OutletName that Trump began the meeting and then turned it over to Nielsen to provide information on the border. Just seconds into the briefing, the official said, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer leaned over to Pelosi and suggested she interrupt Nielsen.
Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and top House Republicans Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Steve Scalise, R-La., also attended the meeting in the high-security enclave of the White House, which typically is used to handle sensitive information. The location meant that the conversation was not televised, unlike the volatile sitdown during which Democratic leaders talked back to Trump last month.
""We do have a crisis on the border right now. We had a violent mob rush yesterday -- we had a challenge there,"" McCarthy said outside the White House after the meeting, referring to the 150 migrants who were repelled by tear gas on New Year's Day at the southern border. ""The president has asked us to come back Friday, after the [House] leadership races, to try to get this all done.""
""I""m a little disappointed with, I would say, some on the other side,"" McCarthy continued. ""Once the secretary [of Homeland Security] started, Senator Schumer interrupted her, and they really didn't want to hear it.""
Instead, McCarthy said, Democrats wanted to push their proposed spending bill without funding for the president's proposed border wall.
Schumer, in his own remarks to reporters, said Republicans are ""now feeling the heat"" as a result of the shutdown. He charged that Republican leaders essentially were holding the federal government ""hostage.""
""So, the bottom line is very simple,"" Schumer said. ""We asked the president to support the bills that we support that will open up government.""
In an interview Wednesday, Pelosi told OutletName' Savannah Guthrie that Democrats would give the president ""nothing for the wall.""
""We can go through the back and forth. No. How many more times can we say no? Nothing for the wall,"" Pelosi said.
A senior House Republican member told OutletName as the meeting was underway that the president was likely to stand firm, and that the partial shutdown may soon become the longest in history -- exceeding even the 21-day shutdown that ended in January 1996.
In an interview published over the weekend, outgoing White House chief of staff John Kelly stated that the White House itself has abandoned plans for a concrete wall, opting instead for a system of steel slats at the border -- a proposal Trump has advocated, while also insisting a wall will be built.
""It doesn't have to last much longer at all -- I think we can come to an agreement rather quickly,"" McCarthy responded when asked how long the shutdown would continue. ""I know that's why the president thought maybe after the leadership races, people would be more willing to come to an agreement.""
In a Cabinet meeting earlier Wednesday that served as a preview of the briefing with Hill leaders, the president maintained his stance that funding for a wall along the southern border would be a necessary component of any spending bill to reopen the remainder of the federal government.
""Once the secretary [of Homeland Security] started, Senator [Chuck] Schumer interrupted her."" — GOP House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy
“If they knew they couldn’t come through, they wouldn’t even start,” Trump said at the meeting with Cabinet secretaries and top advisers. “We have to have a wall.”
He pointed to the New Year's Day episode in which an estimated 150 migrants apparently tried to rush the southern border near Tijuana, Mexico. Some of the migrants threw rocks at U.S. officials and reportedly hoisted babies over their heads, as Border Patrol responded with tear gas.
“We need a wall and in the end, I believe we will be successful,"" Trump said, arguing that drones and technology alone would not have deterred the 150 migrants.
HOW SANCTUARY STATE LAW PROTECTED ALLEGED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT COP-KILLER FROM DEPORTATION
Trump said the U.S.-Mexico border has been “like a sieve,” and vowed to “make a plea” for his border wall.
The Democratic package to end the shutdown would include one bill to temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels — with $1.3 billion for border security, far less than Trump has said he wants for the wall — through Feb. 8 as talks continued.
It also would include another measure to fund the departments of Agriculture, Interior, Housing and Urban Development and others closed by the partial shutdown. That measure would provide money through the remainder of the fiscal year, to Sept. 30.
Pelosi said Tuesday that Democrats would take action to ""end the Trump Shutdown"" by passing legislation to reopen the government Thursday, when the new Congress is seated. Whether the Republican-led Senate would consider the Democratic funding bills — or if Trump would sign either into law — was unclear. McConnell spokesman Donald Stewart said Senate Republicans would not take action without Trump's backing.
The shutdown began on Dec. 22, as Democrats vowed to block any funding for Trump’s border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and Trump insisted on billions for the long-promised barrier.
While much of the federal government has been running as normal, the partial shutdown has forced hundreds of thousands of federal workers to stay home or work without pay, and has closed some federal services and tourist sites. Approximately a quarter of federal workers are affected.
For his part, Trump has remarked that he had been ""lonely"" at the White House during the holiday break, having skipped his getaway to Mar-a-Lago in Florida. He claimed his only companions were the ""machine gunners,"" referring to security personnel, and ""they don't wave, they don't smile.""
He also criticized Pelosi for vacationing in Hawaii during the shutdown, even as she blamed the White House for failing to resolve it.
NANCY PELOSI'S DAUGHTER ISSUES WARNING: 'SHE'LL CUT YOUR HEAD OFF'
On Tuesday morning, after tweeting a New Year's message to ""EVERYONE INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA,"" Trump tweeted: ""The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security.""
But he seemed to shift tactics later in the day, appealing to Pelosi. ""Let's make a deal?"" he tweeted.

488,"Conservative Hispanic activist Anna Paulina told OutletName News that the Democrat Party reminds black Americans that slavery once existed in the country, yet the same politicians “turn a blind eye” when it comes to modern-day slavery of Latin Americans, enabled by unsecured borders.
“You have people like Nancy Pelosi, one of the most powerful women in politics rights now,” said Paulina to OutletName News in Los Angeles at Candace Owens’ first Blexit event, “saying that she cares about children — that she cares about Hispanics.”
“Yet [Pelosi] is ignoring the stats that the State Department put out, she’s ignoring the fact that there is literally slavery of women and children,” continued Paulina, “These children — they are trafficked, they are raped, they are killed, and [Democrats] turn a blind eye to it.”
Paulina also noted the hypocrisy perpetuated by Democrat politicians.
“They will remind black Americans every single day, that at one point, there was slavery,” said Paulina, “but when it comes to Hispanics, they turn a blind eye to [slavery], because, you know what, they only care about the vote.”
“They care about the fact that if they turn Hispanics into single-issues voters on immigration — that they’ll have their vote in 2020,” added the activist, “That’s why so many of us have come here [to Blexit] today, to say that we’re done with this — we don’t want anything to do with the Democratic Party.”
Paulina also mentioned that politicians have not formed any real resolutions on immigration, despite it being an issue for the past fifteen years.
“It’s not until now, that we’re seeing something potentially being done in the near future,” added the Hispanic activist, in reference to President Trump’s plan to secure the United States southern border.
“I hope to God that President Trump does that,” concluded Paulina, “because there’s a lot of innocent people that are being killed in the process.”

1597,"It has been an eventful few weeks in President Trump’s ever-escalating crusade to restrict immigration. On Aug. 12, his administration announced a rule change making it more difficult for poor immigrants to obtain green cards by giving officials more leeway in assessing who is likely to become a “public charge,” meaning someone who relies on public services. On Aug. 21, it introduced a new rule jettisoning the existing 20-day limit on holding migrant children in detention. The next day, the president reasserted his interest in abolishing birthright citizenship, the constitutional guarantee that anyone born in the United States is automatically a citizen. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump’s summer maneuvers can survive the court challenges that so frequently attend his immigration agenda. On Monday, a group of 19 states and the District of Columbia filed suit against his family-detention rule. His “public charge” rule also drew a flurry of filings, including one by a coalition of 13 Democratic state attorneys general, led by Washington state, and one by a separate multistate bloc led by California. (California has thus far filed 13 lawsuits against the administration on immigration matters.) There is also uncertainty as to whether Mr. Trump’s draconian immigration policies will turn out to be the political boon he and his supporters expect — hardly a given in light of recent surveys showing that less than 40 percent of voters approve of his handling of the issue. Whatever its long-term implications, the president’s obsession with what he has termed an immigrant “invasion” is already undermining the functioning of his administration and the safety of the nation. The Boston Globe reported last week that a mass diversion of immigration officers from New England to the Southwest border will bring to a stop the processing of nearly all 40,000 asylum requests pending in New England. Similarly, back in March, senior staff members at United States Citizenship and Immigration Services were told that, by year’s end, the agency would shut down its international division, which assists overseas applicants applying to immigrate to the United States, to redirect resources to the border crisis. As if the legal immigration system needed additional stressors. As the Department of Homeland Security is compelled to expend ever more resources on the border mess, other basic elements of protecting the country risk getting lost, such as dealing with national emergencies — on top of the nearly $10 million that the administration diverted from the Federal Emergency Management Agency last year to fund detention and removal operations by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement it plans to pull another $155 million specifically from the agency’s disaster relief fund this year — or combating the rise of white nationalist terror. Despite claims by some that white nationalism isn’t a serious problem in the United States, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, Kevin McAleenan, affirmed that there has been a rise in the number of domestic terrorist acts fueled by this toxic ideology. This will not surprise anyone familiar with the recent congressional testimony of the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray. In an appearance last month before the Senate Judiciary Committee, he reported that, since the start of the fiscal year in October, the bureau had made around 100 arrests related to domestic terrorism, with a majority of the cases “motivated by some version of what you might call white-supremacist violence.” He assured lawmakers that the bureau was “aggressively” investigating such activities. Likewise, Mr. McAleenan said that the issue has been one of his “top priorities” since taking office in April and that he has asked an advisory council “to help us study domestic terrorism, especially white-supremacist extremism and racially motivated violence.” The White House appears ambivalent about the threat. Earlier this month, OutletName reported that, for more than a year, the White House rebuffed efforts by Homeland Security to make domestic terrorism a strategic priority. One former senior Trump official told the network that the president didn’t like the topic “because the preponderance of it involves white supremacy and that’s not something this administration is comfortable speaking out against.” More broadly, the president’s immigration approach continues to fuel instability at Homeland Security, where several officials — including former Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen — have been pushed out in recent months for being insufficiently hard-line. Last week, Axios broke the news that a top aide to Mr. McAleenan, Andrew Meehan, was leaving amid tensions between the White House and department leadership. Mr. McAleenen himself is regarded with skepticism by some of Mr. Trump’s more hawkish allies, who have pressed for his removal. In June, the president voiced hesitation about permanently nominating Mr. McAleenan, saying he still needed “to get used to him.” The appointment in June of Thomas Homan, a Trump loyalist and an immigration hard-liner, to coordinate policy as the White House “border czar” was seen by some as a sign that Mr. Trump lacks confidence in Homeland Security officials. Every president brings into office a particular set of principles and priorities. But when those biases start undercutting the government’s ability to pursue smart policies — or even carry out basic duties, a responsible leader must think less about his personal prerogatives and more about the nation’s overall security.",1

“You know why you can enjoy a day at the zoo?” the son of President Donald Trump wrote in an Instagram story on Tuesday night. “Because walls work.”

914,"The Trump administration doesn’t need Congress to pass a law or make a sweeping regulation to overhaul the US immigration system – it’s already doing it through a series of small moves that add up to dramatic change. While the administration continues to pressure Congress to grant it broad new authorities, just the past week illustrates how substantial a change is already underway, with each individual move adding up to an effort that could have lasting effects on how the US welcomes and evaluates immigrants. Since last Thursday, here are some of the moves the administration has made: Attorney General Jeff Sessions quietly reopened an immigration court precedent that he could single-handedly overrule, looking at whether the government needs to pause deportation proceedings until an immigrant is done pursuing legitimate claims to stay in the US.
President Donald Trump opted to not extend work permits and protections for approximately 840 Liberians who have been living and working in the US for at least 16 years and in some cases decades. Previous presidents had extended the permits on humanitarian grounds.
The Commerce Department will add a question inquiring about citizenship to the 2020 Census, a move critics fear could undercount immigrant communities and thus cost diverse states and localities congressional representation and federal resources.
Immigrations and Customs Enforcement announced it would no longer default to releasing pregnant immigrants from detention, paving the way for more pregnant women to be held in lengthy custody awaiting immigration proceedings.
The State Department moved to formally require all applicants for visas and legal residency in the US to submit five years of social media, email and telephone history with their applications.
The Department of Homeland Security advanced a policy that would substantially expand the types of government programs that could count against an immigrants’ application to stay in the US – potentially skewing the immigration system in favor of high-income immigrants.
The Justice Department settled a lawsuit with West Palm Beach over sanctuary city policies that clarified how much local officials can cooperate with federal immigration authorities.
Trump is exploring whether he could build his long-promised border wall – even though Congress has rejected his request for funds and authority to do so – by using military resources to do it.
US Citizenship and Immigration Services issued a memo that could tighten employers’ abilities to secure high-skilled visas for foreign workers.
And that was all just one week. The activity across the federal government demonstrates how the administration is exploring the full limits of its powers to transform the US immigration system. “What we’re trying to do is make it a fair system, secure the borders, put Americans first and reform it in a way that keeps America safe,” said Homeland Security spokesman Tyler Houlton. RELATED: Why putting a citizenship question on the census is a big deal But pro-immigration advocates say the moves add up to a dramatic change. “The Trump administration has a lot of money and a lot of authority, and they’re using every ounce of it,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of the pro-immigration group America’s Voice. “They’re trying to turn our tradition of welcoming newcomers into a visible and invisible wall that keeps people out and kicks people out.” Trump’s executive orders issued in the early days of his presidency laid the groundwork and vision for the policy changes, but it’s been a series of procedural moves by his agencies that have had the most impact. As the administration has staffed up and had experts confirmed to key positions, the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security’s components have in particular been rolling out and developing policies that sometimes don’t even require formal rulemaking procedure to accomplish change. In particular, the agencies have drawn heavily on staff from Sessions’ former Senate office and like-minded offices and groups that have advocated for sharply restricting immigration. In many cases, only the court system will offer opponents an avenue to challenge the authority of the administration to make such moves, a process that could take years. Immigration lawyers say they’ve already seen the effects of greater scrutiny of applications for visas, they say slowing down the process and setting higher bars for longstanding categories of visas all under the mantle of “Buy American, Hire American” efforts and so-called “extreme vetting.” It’s been accompanied by a sharp rise in arrests of undocumented immigrants and especially a rise in those without criminal records, also accomplished by simple changes in prioritization and definitions. And the administration has already pledged more efforts in the works, including further tightening high-skilled visas and work permits for those visa-holders’ spouses, though rolling that out has been delayed.",1
752,"No single issue can fire up a national debate quite like anything related to immigration — particularly during the Trump era.
When President Trump decried the doctrine of birthright citizenship on the campaign trail in 2015, it sparked a national debate, with many on the Left and Right issuing ad hoc condemnations.
When news broke Tuesday that the president is considering ending birthright citizenship with an executive order, many of these same voices, once again, condemned the president, claiming birthright citizenship is indeed constitutional.
But if this were true, why wasn’t the 14th Amendment applied to illegal or temporary immigrants prior to the 1960s?
The doctrine of birthright citizenship — the idea that citizenship is granted merely by being born within the geographic limits of the United States — is nowhere to be found in the Constitution.
The 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, also known as the Civil War Amendments, were promulgated to protect the newly freed slaves and to emphasize that they are, in fact, citizens of the United States and privy to the same natural and constitutional rights as any other citizen.
It’s no coincidence that the citizenship clause is within the 14th Amendment that also includes the Equal Protection Clause.
Prior to the amendment, state citizenship automatically conferred national citizenship. After the conclusion of the Civil War, however, the states decided to nationalize citizenship out of fear that some states would not recognize the newly freed slaves as citizens.
“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof (italics mine), are citizens of the United States,” reads the Fourteenth Amendment’s citizenship clause.
Presently, it’s as if the Courts, politicians and the punditry who support birthright citizenship elide completely any mention of jurisdiction as if it were to only say “all persons born or naturalized in the United States … are citizens of the United States.”
But there’s one glaring problem: it does not.
The author of the clause — Michigan Sen. Jacob Howard — made clear in the halls of Congress the clause’s intent. He explains that “jurisdiction thereof” was meant to exclude “persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to families of ambassadors or foreign ministers,” and that “jurisdiction” meant “full and complete jurisdiction.”
This was as understood both by Congress and the people as Howard’s speeches were disseminated to the public at the time.
No one is disputing that anyone on American soil is not subject to territorial jurisdiction, and required to follow American law. But it doesn’t follow that one is also afforded political jurisdiction. If, for example, an illegal alien were afforded the latter he would be able to vote, serve on jury and could not be deported, he could self-immigrate and be afforded complete sovereignty akin to that of a citizen.
Only when an alien becomes an American citizen, repeating the oath of allegiance to the United States that is part of our naturalization process, are they granted political jurisdiction. This is the moment when jurisdiction becomes full and complete.
As late 19th-century scholar and Judge Thomas Cooley writes in his treatise The General Principles of Constitutional Law in America:
[A] citizen by birth must not only be born within the United States, but he must also be subject to the jurisdiction thereof; and by this is meant that full and complete jurisdiction to which citizens generally are subject, and not any qualified and partial jurisdiction, such as may consist with allegiance to some other government.
“This amendment which I have offered is simply declaratory of what I regard as the law of the land already,” Howard said in his remarks introducing the new language before the Senate in 1866. The law he was referring to was the Civil Rights Act of 1866, passed less than two months prior over a veto from then-President Andrew Johnson by a two-thirds majority in both houses.
“[T]hat all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States,” read the citizenship provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.
Considering the political climate immediately following the Civil War, there were legitimate concerns the Act may be in jeopardy, so “the Congress took steps to include similar language when it considered the draft of the Fourteenth Amendment,” according to the Library of Congress.
In 1873, five years after the Fourteenth Amendment’s passage, U.S. Attorney General George Williams, in a legal opinion, explained that the term “jurisdiction” meant “absolute and complete jurisdiction” excluding aliens, even those born on American soil. The clause also excluded Native Americans (who the majority of, at the time, had little desire to be American citizens).
Howard assured his colleagues this language would not confer citizenship on Native Americans, who were born within the Country’s geographical limits, because they owe allegiance to their tribes.
To Lyman Trumbull, chairman of senate judiciary committee, subject to the “jurisdiction thereof,” meant “not owing allegiance to anybody else and being subject to the complete jurisdiction of the United States.”
The desideratum of “absolute” jurisdiction excludes any children who might owe allegiance to another sovereign, such as children that are subjects of any foreign government as explained in Elk v. Wilkins in 1884.
Foreign citizens cannot bestow jurisdiction on their children merely by giving birth within the geographic boundaries of the United States, only with the consent of the sovereign people can they be conferred jurisdiction.
It wasn’t until 1898 in United States v. Wong Kim Ark, that the “separate but equal” court, held that any child born in the U.S. of legal immigrant parents with “permanent” residence in the United States are guaranteed citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment. A narrow exception would be for children of diplomats.
There is zero precedent for allowing citizenship to children born to illegal alien parents. Article 1, section 8, clause 4 gives plenary power to Congress over naturalization and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment over jurisdiction, which Congress altered to allow Indians born in the US to become citizens in 1924.
There is no existing law passed by Congress as of now that gives jurisdiction to illegal aliens born in the United States.
The executive and judiciary don’t have the power to decide the issue.
The debate over whether Trump can sign an executive order to end the practice of birthright citizenship is a different argument entirely.",0
1771,"The additional immigration officers are so “we can eliminate MS-13 and root out the criminal cartels from our country,” Mr. Trump said. “Now, we’re getting them out anyway, but we’d like to get them out a lot faster. And when you see these towns, and when you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough — I said, ‘Please don’t be too nice.’”
He went on: “Like, when you guys put somebody in the car and you’re protecting their head, you know, the way you put your hand over” their head. “Like, don’t hit their head and they’ve just killed somebody. Don’t hit their head. I said, ‘You can take the hand away, O.K.?’”
The officers assembled behind the president applauded. But a short time later, the Suffolk County Police Department sought to distance itself from Mr. Trump’s urgings. “As a department, we do not and will not tolerate roughing up of prisoners,” it tweeted later on Friday afternoon. It said the department “has strict rules & procedures relating to the handling of prisoners. Violations of those rules are treated extremely seriously.”
At another point, Mr. Trump painted a cinematic portrait of freeing a shackled United States. “One by one, we’re liberating our American towns,” Mr. Trump said of the work to remove undocumented immigrants.
“Can you believe that I’m saying that? I’m talking about liberating our towns. Like you’d see in a movie,” Mr. Trump continued. “They’re liberating the town. Like in the old Wild West, right? We’re liberating our towns. I never thought I’d be standing up here talking about liberating towns on Long Island where I grew up. But that’s what you’re doing.”
Almost in passing, Mr. Trump criticized the Senate for refusing to approve a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and called for the nation’s health care law — President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement — to “implode.”
“They’ve been working on that one for seven years. You can believe that? The swamp. But we’ll get it done. We’re going to get it done. You know, I said from the beginning, let Obamacare implode, and then do it. I turned out to be right. Let Obamacare implode,” Mr. Trump said.",1
70,"President Trump made his case to the American people in an Oval Office address Tuesday night for funding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border as a means of protecting our nation and ending the ongoing partial government shutdown. And the top Democrats in Congress – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York – followed minutes later by making the opposite case in their own televised remarks, saying a wall is not needed. The president and congressional Democrats remain locked in a standoff over the president’s demand for more than $5 billion to build the border wall, in the third week of the second-longest government shutdown in U.S. history. President Trump called the situation on the southern border both a “humanitarian” and “national security” crisis. He added: “The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only, because Democrats will not fund border security … the only solution is for the Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our border and reopens the government.” Trump is obviously sidestepping the fact that on their first day in control of the House last week, the new Democratic majority did in fact pass a spending bill that increased border security and would have reopened the government. The president continued in his address to the nation: “Hopefully, we can all rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.” Ultimately, now is the time for compromise, not political posturing. For the sake of the nation and of his presidency, the president needs to relent on his hardline demand for over $5 billion in border wall funding, and should be willing to make a deal with the Democrats. And a bipartisan solution may be possible. Throughout 2017, Schumer was working on a deal to provide the Trump administration with funding for a border wall in exchange for protection from deportation for DACA recipients – some 700,000 young people brought to the U.S. as children in violation of our immigration laws. This deal made sense then, and it makes sense now. The need for compromise is clear, and it is up to both President Trump and congressional Democrats to put partisanship aside and make a deal for the good of the nation. In his own response to the president Tuesday night, Schumer said: “There is bipartisan legislation – supported by Democrats and Republicans – to reopen government while allowing debate over border security to continue.” Pelosi and Schumer were able to use their remarks as an opportunity to show America that the Democrats are willing and able to be the party of leadership that promotes effective alternatives to the Trump administration. It does not help the president’s cause in negotiating with Democrats that the data and purported facts his administration uses to defend the border wall are often questionable, if not inaccurate. On Sunday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the administration’s immigration agenda when facing questions from Chris Wallace of OutletName. “Nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border,” Sanders said, giving the frequently quoted statistic from the Trump administration. “I know this statistic,” Wallace jumped in, “I didn’t know if you were going to use it, so I studied up on this. Do you know where those 4,000 people … where they’re captured? Airports.” Indeed, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data that was provided to Congress in 2018 states that CBP only encountered six immigrants at ports of entry on the U.S-Mexico border in the first half of fiscal year 2018 who were known or suspected terrorists. However, we cannot forget that immigration reform is a legitimate and concerning issue that needs to be addressed by lawmakers. And this can only be done through bipartisan legislation. The need for compromise is clear, and it is up to both President Trump and congressional Democrats to put partisanship aside and make a deal for the good of the nation. Democrats and Republicans are only weakening the country by closing down the government over the wall. It makes no sense for Democrats to walk away from a valid proposal to protect our country. Compromise is possible, and I implore both Republicans and Democrats to come to a consensus and provide funding for the wall as a tradeoff for protections for DACA recipients.",0
31,"Basketball Hall of Famer Rick Barry said Sunday the U.S. should be helping out those who served the country first before spending “billions of dollars on people who aren’t even supposed to be in this country.” Barry, during an appearance on  “Life, Liberty & Levin,” told host Mark Levin no one can justify a country that is borrowing money to give it away to countries where leaders are getting richer and are leaving out the people who are actually supposed to receive the help. “Then we spend billions of dollars on people who aren’t even supposed to be in this country,” Barry said. “And I know we were found on immigrants ... but the people came over here and did it the proper way and they took pride in being part of America.” Barry added that veterans need to be getting more help. ""The way we treat our military -- or the people who have helped to make this country what it is today -- is reprehensible that we have these guys living out in the streets,” he said. Barry added: “It really does bother me that they can sit around and supposedly be doing their job representing us but then vote on things and pass things for their benefit and not go ahead and ask us is it OK if we do this. They just do it on their own.” The 12-time All-Star also took issue with those who originally supported the U.S. building a wall along the border with Mexico and now are against it. Barry said politicians are against the wall because it’s President Trump who decided to go forth with a plan. “All of these people who are now against [building the wall]. Why? Because it's Donald Trump trying to get the wall built,” Barry said. “But when it was other people and other presidents trying to get the wall they were all for it. How conveniently they forgot the fact that they were for it. But now all of a sudden they're not for it. What changed?” Barry, who played in the NBA for the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets and in the ABA for the Oakland Oaks, Washington Capitols and New York Nets, is now focused on coaching in the Big3 Basketball League. He is the coach of the Ball Hogs, which features former NBA players Brian Scalabrine, Josh Childress and DeShawn Stevenson.",0
1769,"In pre-election surveys, Donald J. Trump polled worse than Hillary Clinton on just about every question. Voters viewed him more unfavorably, thought he was unqualified for the presidency and, yes, even thought he was more dishonest than Mrs. Clinton. The most straightforward interpretation of the polling — that her clear lead was fairly solid, since it was underpinned by an advantage on whether she was fit to be president — simply did not pan out.
This isn’t a small problem. Journalists have traditionally relied on issue and character questions to frame the story of American elections. It’s how most public pollsters rationalize the cost of horse-race polling. Political consultants often take a similar approach to try to shape their messages, which winds up influencing the promises and programs of elected officials. But the seemingly clear story told by the polls has led us somewhat astray, and it’s probably part of why elected officials, journalists and pollsters were caught off guard in 2016.
So what’s going on?
The issue could be something fundamental: The questions are bad, or voters are misrepresenting their opinions. But assuming that’s not the problem, here are a few possibilities.
It’s about enthusiasm
An issue position might be broadly popular, but those who back the minority view my be far more likely to vote on the issue. This is a common explanation for why gun control seems to play so poorly for the Democrats. The liberal viewpoint on gun control and background checks really is popular; it’s just that the conservatives back their viewpoint far more enthusiastically.
This might be a part of the explanation, but the problem seems to run deeper. Increased background checks for guns — almost universally popular in most polls — prevailed only narrowly in Nevada in November and failed outright in Maine.
Affirmative action hasn’t been held up as universally popular like background checks, and it has not fared well at the ballot box. It lost in a 2006 referendum in Michigan by a 16-point margin.
It’s not useful to look only at the whole public
The idea here is that there’s some critical group of voters who might matter more than others. Gun control and immigration overhaul might be popular nationwide, for example, but the electoral politics could play differently if a significant share of a persuadable and targeted voting group took the position not favored by the majority. This could have been a big factor in electoral politics over the last few years. White working-class Democratic-leaners were always the weakest link in the Obama coalition, and there’s plenty of evidence that a significant chunk of them are sympathetic to the minority view on a lot of issues, including trade, immigration and guns. For good measure, white working-class voters have disproportionate sway in the Senate and the Electoral College. But it’s hard to examine groups of persuadable voters using individual national polls. Making the issue even more challenging: Older white working-class voters are underrepresented in the average national poll of adults compared with their share of the electorate.
By this measure, affirmative action is probably less popular politically than a national survey would imply.
But perhaps the biggest problem of all is that the voters that were decisive in the last election might not be decisive in the next one.
Messaging changes opinion
Another possibility is that voters really do support background checks for guns until they hear the counter-messaging, like the prospect that the government might take everyone’s guns.
Similarly, voters might quickly split along partisan lines once a party or a candidate weighs in on an issue.
Elections aren’t simply about policy
Whether voters support or oppose a policy may simply not be all that important to their vote.
Maybe the state of the economy and whether they approve of the incumbent president are likeliest to affect their vote choice. Republican strength is certainly consistent with that possibility, given the modest pace of economic growth and Democratic control of the White House for eight years. If that’s true, perhaps the Republican Party’s comparatively unpopular policies might set them up for big defeats.
The party of the presidency might be especially important. Political scientists have long argued that the public is like a thermostat: It tends to move against the direction of policy change and the party in power. President Obama’s health care push, for instance, soured voters on government involvement in health care; President Trump’s effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act has sent attitudes in the other direction. If public opinion toward policy-making tends to move against the initiatives of the incumbent president, a bold policy agenda — like the one pursued by the Democrats during the Obama administration — might be politically damaging even if the individual proposals might otherwise be popular.
Perhaps issues matter, not because of the policy, but because of the message it sends about a candidate. President Trump, for instance, could reinforce his appeal among white voters with unpopular stances that nonetheless reinforce the view that he intends to govern on their behalf. A Muslim ban might not be popular as policy, but it shows his seriousness in pursuing terrorists. A wall might not be popular, yet shows his seriousness in taking on undocumented immigrants.
This isn’t an exhaustive list, but all of these factors might have played some role in allowing a seemingly unpopular agenda to bring Republicans to power. Issue polling has its place. A government in a democracy should be aware of the views of the public. But if you’re strictly interested in electoral consequences, you’re probably a lot better off focusing on the president’s approval rating than the popularity of the president’s policy agenda.",1
738,"The caravan making its way through various parts of Central America to the U.S. border has already swelled to around 14,000 people, according to a major Mexican newspaper. This staggering statistic, and even more conservative estimates, would render the mass of migrants larger than many American towns and communities, according to a review of U.S. census data.
El Universal claims to have received the 14,000 number from “municipal authorities, [southwestern Mexican city] Tapachula’s diocese, and the National Migration Institute.” According to The Daily Mail, the number includes up to 10,000 in the main Mexican caravan, 1,500-2,000 more in a second Guatemalan caravan, and an additional 2,500 “planning to mobilize” in Honduras and El Salvador. The Mexican National Migration Institute cited by El Universal did not respond to OutletName’s request for comment in time for publishing.
Reports conflict regarding the exact number of people who comprise what the Associated Press has described as “the biggest [migrant caravan] ever.” A U.N. spokesperson gave a more conservative estimate last week, claiming that there were 7,200 individuals in the caravan. The Mexican government claimed last Tuesday it was even smaller, at around 4,500 people.
Some Mexican sources claim that the caravan is dwindling, but other sources say it is growing as it moves through Guatemala and Mexico toward the U.S. border. But even if the smaller estimates are more accurate, the caravan could still rival many American small towns in size. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, there were 16,570 incorporated places in the U.S. with a population of under 10,000 people.
In a May 2018 press release, the U.S. Census Bureau wrote that “the United States is a nation of small towns,” and that “of the nation’s 325.7 million people, an estimated 205.0 million (62.9 percent) live within an incorporated place as of July 1, 2017.”
“Of approximately 19,500 incorporated places,” the release continued, “about 76 percent had fewer than 5,000 people and nearly 50 percent had fewer than 1,000 people.”
As the caravan pushes its way through Mexico, controversy surrounds its origins and how best to deal with it. Last week, Vice President Mike Pence claimed that Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández told him that the caravan is being funded by the government of Venezuela.
The L.A. Times reported that “Denis Omar Contera, an organizer with Pueblo Sin Fronteras [People Without Borders], which is helping the group,” reportedly “laughed off claims made by some Republicans that the caravan is being organized by Democrats or political opponents of the right-wing president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez.”
The “dream” of Pueblo Sin Fronteras, according to the group’s website, is “to build solidarity bridges among peoples and turndown [sic] border walls imposed by greed.”
Last week, President Donald Trump said “I am watching the Democrat Party-led (because they want Open Borders and existing weak laws) assault on our country by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people, INCLUDING MANY CRIMINALS, from entering Mexico to U.S…..”

266,"President Trump slammed Democrats Tuesday, suggesting they want to “shut down the Government,” just days before the deadline, underscoring his non-negotiable campaign promise to build a “great WALL” along the U.S.-Mexico border.
“We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER, and we must have a great WALL to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!” Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.
Minutes later, he tweeted again, pushing for a “merit based” immigration system.
“The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military, at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now! No more dangerous lottery,” Trump tweeted.
On Friday at 11:59:59 p.m. ET, the funding to keep the federal government running expires. If congressional lawmakers cannot come to a bipartisan agreement, the government will close on Jan. 20—the one year anniversary of Trump taking office.
Congressional lawmakers, on both sides of the aisle, have punted a long-term budget solution, and have continued to pass just short-term stop-gap spending deals as they negotiate their policy must-haves.
The president has accused Democrats of blocking any agreement on a spending bill, due to their demands of preserving the Obama-era Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals—the program that protects immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children from deportation.
Republicans, though, are looking for increased defense funding, and for border security—including changes to the so-called Visa Lottery System and to “chain migration” programs. The president has argued that the wall along the southern border must be included in any comprehensive immigration reform deal.

509,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said Thursday that President Donald Trump will sign legislation to prevent a second partial government shutdown and declare a national emergency to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
“He’s prepared to sign the bill, he will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time,” McConnell said ahead of a Senate vote on a measure to keep the government running past the February 15 deadline.
The comprise measure keeps departments running through the fiscal year but without the $5.7 billion the president wanted for the border wall with Mexico.
Moments after McConnell’s remarks, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a statement that the president will sign the funding bill and take executive action to build the wall. “President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action – including a national emergency – to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border. The President is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country,” Sanders said.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Democrats “may” file a legal challenge if a national emergency is declared, saying she and other party leaders are reviewing their options. “I may, that’s an option. We will review our options,” she said when asked if Democrats will take legal action. “But it’s important to note that when the president declares this emergency, first of all, it’s not an emergency. What’s happening at the border is a humanitarian challenge to us. The president is trying to sell a bill of goods.”
Following Pelosi’s remarks, Sanders told reporters that the administration is “very prepared” for legal challenges, adding that “there shouldn’t be” any. “The president’s doing his job. Congress should do theirs,” she said.
The Democrat-controlled House is poised to pass the sweeping measure Thursday evening, and the Republican-led Senate is expected to approve as well. Bargainers formally completed the accord moments before midnight Wednesday night.
The product of nearly three weeks of talks, the agreement provides almost $1.4 billion for new barriers along the boundary. That’s less than the $1.6 billion for border security in a bipartisan Senate bill that President Trump spurned months ago, and enough for building just 55 miles of barricades, not the 200-plus miles he had sought.
Notably, the word “wall” — which fueled many a chant at Trump campaign events and then his rallies as president — does not appear once in the 1,768 pages of legislation and explanatory materials. “Barriers” and “fencing” are the nouns of choice.
The compromise would also squeeze funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in an attempt to pressure the agency to gradually detain fewer immigrants.
Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, House Freedom Caucus chair Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) warned “it would be political suicide” if the president backs the bill and does not seek money elsewhere to fund the wall.

802,"Niger Innis accused Symone Sanders of being an apologist for the anti-ICE movement on the left during their appearance on OutletName’s “Cuomo Prime Time” Friday night.
They were debating Kamala Harris’s statements about the perception of ICE, from Wednesday.
The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee was considering the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to be assistant Homeland Security secretary for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. During Harris’s questioning, she asked if Vitiello could see any parallels between ICE and the KKK.
“Let’s push past the hyperbole and get to the actual policy behind it. Do you believe that whether or not ICE should be abolished. Is that a legit question for Democrats to be asking in your opinion, Symone? Is that really something you guys should be considering?” Cuomo asked Sanders. Sanders responded, “You know, I think for Democrats that have come out on record that said they want ICE to be abolished, people should be asking those folks about abolishing ICE. But I think an overwhelming number of Democrats have come out and said we need to fix our broken immigration system, which would need to be a bipartisan effort, and when it comes to ICE perhaps we need to revisit it and there are currently many Democrats, myself including, that believe ICE is not currently operating inside its mission.”
“Are you open to that suggestion, Niger? That it’s not about abolishing, that the last thing we need is less people keeping the border safe but in terms of how they do their job, what their mandate is, and how it’s executed, is that something you would be open to reviewing?” Cuomo questioned Innis.
“I have strong libertarian instincts and any government entity needs proper oversight, supervision, and direction. But that is not what the extremists in the progressive movement are doing. They are demonizing the thousands of decent ICE officers that are trying to enforce our laws, including Senator Harris with her perception comparison of the Klan to ICE. So don’t run away from it, Symone. It was disgusting what she did,” Innis responded, mimicking Harris during his use of the word “perception.” “And she is spitting —I will say it again — Spitting on the memories of those who fought in the Civil War and the civil rights revolution against the Klan that terrorized black folk for over 100 years. Disgusting and Kamala Harris needs to apologize.”
“Look, Senator Harris is not apologizing for anything, I think we can be sure because she’d been very clear about what her position is,” Sanders added.
“Because she has apologists like you, Symone, defending her,” Innis retaliated.
Sanders asked, “Did you just call me an apologist?”
“I sure did,” Innis confirmed.
“I think you need a history lesson, sir,” Sanders responded.
Innis concluded, “Oh, please, give it to me, Symone, I want it.”",0
170,"As many as 200,000 Salvadoran immigrants living in the United States will no longer be allowed to stay after the Trump administration announced the end to their protected status.
The Central Americans had been permitted to stay following a devastating earthquake in 2001, under Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.
In the 17 years that have followed, every administration has extended their window to stay, including the Obama administration in September 2016.
But new Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen determined Monday that the ""substantial disruption of living conditions caused by the earthquake no longer exist,"" according to the Department of Homeland Security.
The move could force those who had been protected under TPS to leave the U.S. by September 2019 or face deportation.
DHS states that the Salvadoran immigrants have 18 months until the official termination, in an effort to give them time to arrange for departure and for El Salvador to ""prepare for the return and reintegration of its citizens.""
The decision also gives the Salvadorans time to apply for other legal avenues to continue living in the United States. Last year, DHS also announced that they had ended TPS for Haitian and Nicaraguan citizens living in the U.S.
Salvadorans have been, by far, the largest beneficiaries of the program, which provides humanitarian relief for foreigners whose countries are hit with natural disasters or other strife.
The new DHS decision produces a serious challenge for El Salvador, a country of 6.2 million people whose economy counts on money sent by wage earners in the U.S. Over the past decade, growing numbers of Salvadorans -- many coming as families or unaccompanied children -- have entered the United States illegally through Mexico, fleeing violence and poverty.
Nielsen, who faced a Monday deadline for a decision, determined that El Salvador has received significant international aid to recover from the earthquake and that homes, schools and hospitals there have been rebuilt. Homeland Security also said more than 39,000 Salvadorans have returned home from the U.S. in two years, demonstrating El Salvador's capacity to absorb people.

749,"President Donald Trump mocked former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s support of an end to birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants by highlighting one of his past videos, in a Wednesday tweet.
Harry Reid, when he was sane, agreed with us on Birthright Citizenship!
Reid introduced the Immigration Stabilization Act in 1993, which would have revoked birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants. Reid stressed at the time that he intended to remove the “incentive for pregnant alien women to enter the United States illegally, often at risk to mother and child, for the purpose of acquiring citizenship for the child and accompanying federal financial benefits.”
Reid later retracted his support of an end to birthright citizenship and issued a statement criticizing Trump for including his name.
Harry Reid, undergoing cancer treatment, issues statement about his past “mistake” on birthright citizenship. “In 1993, around the time Donald Trump was gobbling up tax-free inheritance money from his wealthy father and driving several companies into bankruptcy, I made a mistake”
Trump told Axios Monday evening he will issue a future executive order to end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants and some other non-citizens, adding “it was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment. Guess what? You don’t.”
“We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States … with all of those benefits,” Trump continued. The president’s expected executive order is certain to spark a high stakes legal battle, which is likely to make it all the way to the Supreme Court.
Birthright citizenship stems from the 14th Amendment of the Constitution which states that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”",0
968,"Her high school is more than 1,600 miles from the US-Mexico border – and the immigration debate was far from most of her classmates’ minds. So Brandi Marsch decided to bring the border to them. The 17-year-old senior at Baldwin High School in Pittsburgh created an art installation in a stairwell at school, an interpretation of the struggle of people who try to cross the border. She used barbed wire to symbolize security, hung flowers from the ceiling to recognize the immigrants who die on the difficult journey, and she placed copies of green cards around a fence to highlight the people who make it. Marsch was born in the United States and says she doesn’t have a personal connection to the immigration issue. But what she learned through this project surprised her. “I didn’t understand the amount of effort it took to come into the country itself,” she said. “I didn’t understand the sacrifices people have to make.” The assignment
It started out as a class assignment. Cheryl Foote, Marsch’s art teacher, asked her students to think about a local or global social issue and create a project to display at school. Marsch is a member of Global Minds, an organization that meets after school to discuss world issues. They’d been discussing immigration, and it sparked the idea. The project took her months to complete. She watched documentaries, read articles about immigration and talked to some of the students at school. “More people should be educated about it,” she said. Foote told OutletName she tried to be as hands-off as possible, but she did help Marsch out when she got stuck. “I love how current her piece is and I think it’s so great that the high school students have this artwork that serves as an intro to a conversation,” the art teacher said. Baldwin High School has a large number of students who have moved to the US from another country or who speak English as their second language. Minorities make up 16% of the student population. “It’s relevant to them,” Foote said. When Marsch finally got the principal’s permission to install her project, she set it up in a stairwell at the school in mid-February. Students at Baldwin call it “the cage.” Boxes, suitcases and clothing thrown around within the cage are meant to represent items belonging to people who may have perished crossing the border. Marsch also included stats and facts about immigration to make sure the project was serving its intended purpose: to raise awareness about the issue. She says she’s gotten praise and some criticism of her work – including some people who complained about getting their clothing snagged on the barbed wire. But she’s proud of her project. “Some people didn’t agree with my viewpoint on it, which is totally fine,” Marsch said.",1
87,"As the Trump administration regroups from multiple political and legal setbacks in its efforts to curb illegal immigration, the message south of the border could not be more clear, with families and unaccompanied minors flooding into Texas, Arizona and California. An alarming new report from the Department of Homeland Security shows the number of families crossing into the U.S. illegally surged last month. The agency said illegal immigrants have been taking advantage of a legal loophole that requires “family units” to be released once they are caught. New figures showed a 10 percent increase in August of unaccompanied minors, a 38 percent increase among families entering illegally or asking for asylum. Overall, people arrested or stopped at the border totaled nearly 47,000 in August, up 17 percent from July and up 52 percent from August 2017. Why are illegal immigrants opting out of welfare programs?Video
""These numbers are a result of our failure do what is necessary to control the border,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the right-leaning Center for Immigration Studies. The administration tried separating parents and children to deter immigrants from making the dangerous trek through Mexico, however a political outcry forced it to reverse the policy. It also tried holding in families in detention until their court date, but the courts rejected the policy. As a result, Customs and Border Protection sources say, immigrants see an opportunity to exploit gridlock in Washington and get in while the administration tries to figure out its next step. ""My question is how many illegal immigrants have to be let go into the U.S. for there to be a political demand that something be done about it,"" said Krikorian, who favors stricter border enforcement. The numbers say something entirely different to Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum. ""The situation in Central America is so bad, parents are deciding that the risk of losing their child to the U.S. government is better than the risk of losing their child to violence,"" said Noorani. ""This leaves lawmakers two choices. They can continue a failed strategy of trying to enforce our way out of a problem... Or, they can develop bipartisan solutions that address root causes in Central America and ensure migrants fleeing violence and persecution can seek protection and a fair hearing in the U.S.” In the last nine months, 98.6 percent of families who entered the U.S. illegally or without papers from countries other than Mexico, remain here, and officials say it's likely most will never leave. ""We know that the vast majority of family units who have been released, despite having no right to remain in any legal status, fail to ever depart or be removed,"" DHS Press Secretary Tyler Q. Houlton said Wednesday in a statement. ""Through the third quarter of FY 2018, only 1.4 percent of family units have been repatriated to their home country from noncontiguous countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras."" The highest number of minors and families entering arrived from Guatemala (64,000) following by Honduras (43,000), El Salvador (16,000) and Mexico (11,000). The biggest change agents see is the size of groups they encounter. Instead of a handful of immigrants or groups under 10, they are now apprehending groups of 20 or more. In Lukeville, Arizona, last week, agents stopped a group of 50 spanning a half-mile wide. Instead of running from agents, the immigrants sought them out to request asylum. ""Right now, the word is out. Bring a child,"" a Border Patrol agent in Arizona told OutletName. ""That's their ticket. If they come as an adult, they can be held. If they come as family, or as minor, they can't. They know it. The smugglers tell them."" The Trump administration said Tuesday it's tried to handle the influx by tripling the amount of bed space for unaccompanied minors at its detention camp in Tornillo, Texas, so it can handle up to 3,800 children. It also added 44 new immigration judges and has considered a policy change allowing it to hold families in detention together until their immigration cases are heard. That is likely to face a legal challenge, especially since federal Judge Dolly Gee already declined to change her ruling, that families in detention must be released after 20 days.",0
887,"OutletName’s Jim Acosta believes he brought the “heat” to a Wednesday White House press briefing where he got slammed by Trump adviser Stephen Miller.
Acosta seemed to argue during the briefing that the poem on the Statue of Liberty requires that the United States can’t prioritize high-skilled immigrants.
“Aren’t you trying to change what it means to be an immigrant coming into this country if you’re telling them, you have to speak English when they get here?” Acosta asked.
Miller smacked down Acosta’s claim, responding, “it’s a requirement that to be naturalized you have to speak English, so the notion that speaking English wouldn’t be a part of immigration systems would be very ahistorical.”
However, according to Acosta, Stephen Miller just couldn’t handle the heat that Acosta was bringing to the briefing.
During a OutletName appearance Wednesday night, Acosta said, “We always welcome all kinds of people from all walks of life into this country, all people coming into this country have merit, they shouldn’t be subjected to a point system.”
“I was essentially just trying to test Stephen Miller on a couple of those points and I think what you saw unfold at the briefing was that he just couldn’t take that kind of heat and he exploded before our eyes,” Acosta concluded to the agreement of OutletName host Erin Burnett.
During the press briefing, Miller also called out Acosta for stereotyping immigrants when Acosta suggested that the English requirement would only allow immigrants from “Great Britain and Australia.”
“That you think only people from Great Britain or Australia would speak English is so insulting to millions of hardworking immigrants who do speak English from all over the world,” Miller asserted. “Jim, have you honestly never met an immigrant from another country who speaks English outside of Great Britain and Australia? Is that your personal experience?”",0

In a Monday afternoon “The Five” segment, Rivera responded to a question from co-host Jesse Watters about media dishonesty on the subject by stating his refusal “to deal with this as a media issue, because it’s far too important.”
“This is something that goes to the very quick,” said an emotional Geraldo. “This goes to my soul. Fulfilling my role as the designated piñata on OutletName, I wanna say I am ashamed. This tear gas choked me. We treat these people — these economic refugees — as if they’re zombies from ‘The Walking Dead.’ I think we arrested 42 people, eight of them were women with children! We have to deal with this problem humanely and with compassion! These are not invaders. Stop using these military analogies. This is absolutely painful to watch!”
After asserting that the migrants were only coming “because they want a job,” Rivera essentially accused people of suspending their humanity on the issue “because they look different than the mainstream.”
Co-host Greg Gutfeld responded by contending that the migrants were “being manipulated by a political group, an activist group.” “Now imagine if a group of activists hypnotized a bunch of people to rob a bank,” said Gutfeld. “To go in and rush the bank. It’s not the security guard’s fault that he has to protect the bank.”
The discussion on “The Five” continued, with the other cohosts showing respect for Geraldo’s position despite their disagreement, but in Twitter-world, Flynn Jr. didn’t hold back.
“Geraldo’s sympathy for these ‘migrants’ always seems one-sided,” Flynn Jr. tweeted. “What about sympathy for CBP who had rocks thrown at them? Or sympathy for the AMERICAN TAXPAYER having to continue and fund the absolute MESS that is our immigration system?”

363,"An open letter to the Hollywood Elite and the rest of America: My Dear friends and colleagues, I have recently been pondering President Trump’s executive action with regard to our nation having extreme vetting and our immigration policy finally being enforced. It has pained me deeply to see such a violent reaction to something that, to my mind, makes absolute common sense. Let me begin by saying that I am from a family of immigrants that came to this country for a better life. They came to the US “legally,” assimilated, integrated, and learned English to the best of their ability, and demanded we speak it. As we all know, we live in a time in which there are forces who wish to destroy our way of life. There are thousands of illegal immigrant criminals in the United States whose country of origin will not take them back. These criminals are free on the streets of America. We have recently heard from a plethora of Hollywood stars on this issue — Meryl Streep, Robert DeNiro, Ashley Judd, Madonna, major agencies, musicians, singers and even the indomitable Shia LaBeouf. After much prayer on this issue, I must now stand in solidarity with all of my Hollywood elite brethren. They are right! The rest of you are wrong! It is now in this spirit that I make an appeal to all in Hollywood and the media for us to use the Oscars to take a stand for the entire world to see and hear. It is time for Hollywood to lead the way. I propose that Meryl Steep, Chelsea Handler, Richard Gere, Robert DeNiro, Christoph Waltz and others lead an Oscar first: let’s do away with the rules, barriers, and tickets to the Oscars and after-parties, such as the swanky Vanity Fair party or the Weinsteins’ star-studded affair. I ask all migrants, all illegal immigrant criminals and all un-vetted refugees to converge on Hollywood to come to the Oscars and all the after-parties, even those held at the mansions or the Chateau Marmont or anywhere else. After all, we in the Hollywood community want to show all Islamic extremists that we have love in our hearts — and what better way to do that than by inviting them along on our most important night? It’s time the walls and electronic security gates come down. There are roughly 3,600 seats to the Oscars; we should have at least 2,500 seats reserved for illegal aliens, refugees and migrants, or maybe even more. For those celebrities skipping the ceremony, each should invite at least 100 illegal aliens, refugees or migrants to come to their home to watch the Oscars with them. The Academy and the Vanity Fair people should also get the 150 criminals who have recently been deported from Los Angeles and bring them to the show as honored guests. I find it curious that when President Obama did the same exact thing — and more — in terms of enforcing the law on illegal immigration, the Hollywood elite were silent. Why were they silent then, but are so vocal now when President Trump is doing basically the same thing? Is Hollywood racist? Why — when Christians are being slaughtered in Syria, Iraq, and other places in the Middle East — is Hollywood silent? Of course, the people that wish death upon Christians, Jews, gay people and the West are greeted with open arms by the elite in Hollywood — so why can’t they come to our Oscar parties? Additionally, I am now pleased to announce that Hollywood and the recording industry no longer require the protection of the Men in Blue at any of their events! We do not need a country of laws; only a country of illegal immigrants, refugees and migrants. How dare we ignore the words inscribed on the Statue of Liberty: “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free…” So now, we ask you all: please come to the Oscars on February 26th at the Dolby Theater on Hollywood Boulevard.

2034,"The Trump administration is increasingly hauling asylum-seekers into criminal courts and slapping them with convictions for illegally crossing the border, instead of sending them to immigration judges to hear their claims, according to a new report from the nonprofit group Human Rights First.
While most people who enter the United States illegally are processed by civil immigration courts, crossing the border without authorization is a crime under federal law. The first offense is a misdemeanor, carrying a sentence of up to six months in jail. Getting caught again can lead to felony “illegal re-entry” charges, with sentences of up to 20 years, depending on the person’s criminal record. In practice, most people serve much shorter terms and are then deported.
Those prosecutions aren’t supposed to apply to asylum-seekers. When someone declares a fear of returning to their home country, those words are supposed to trigger a referral to an asylum officer to establish whether the claim is legitimate ― even if the person crosses illegally into the United States. Those claims are heard by the civil immigration system, not the criminal courts.Those rules haven’t changed since Donald Trump was elected president, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection told OutletName in an email.
“Every individual encountered who is a candidate for removal is asked if they have a fear of returning to their country,” the spokesman said. “CBP officers do not determine or evaluate the validity of the fear expressed.”
Last year, agents referred nearly 55,000 immigrants who said they feared returning to their home countries to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, according to CBP. That figure includes people arrested by Border Patrol as well as people who tried to cross through legal ports of entry.
But Human Rights First says the agency routinely violates that policy in practice. In a survey of 39 defense lawyers who handle such cases carried out by the group, 48 percent said asylum-seekers made up about half of their clients. All of the respondents said they had represented at least one asylum-seeker prosecuted for illegal entry or re-entry.
Some lawyers said they had received Border Patrol arrest reports with the words “Credible Fear Claim” stamped on them. A “credible fear” interview is one of the first steps toward applying for asylum.
“This administration has been painting asylum-seekers and really all immigrants as criminals,” Olga Byrne, one of the report’s authors, told OutletName. “And by referring people for prosecution ― including people who previously had no contact with the criminal justice system ― the administration is essentially creating the kinds of statistics they want to put out to the public, that immigrants are criminals.”
The HRF report ― which was based on observation of more than 700 prosecutions across eight federal courts from April 2017 to this month ― cites dozens of cases of people crossing into the U.S. to ask for humanitarian protection, only to find themselves in a group hearing facing expedited criminal charges instead.
One woman from Honduras said she fled death threats and asked for asylum, according to the report. A Mexican man said he feared returning to his home country because his sexual orientation exposed him to violence. A Venezuelan couple who said they faced threats from the government in their home country were charged with illegal entry and separated from their 15-year-old daughter in the process.
Since the advent of a 2005 program called “Operation Streamline,” immigration prosecutions have grown to swallow up a massive share of the federal criminal docket. Immigration prosecutions consistently accounted for about half of the federal criminal docket during the Obama administration.
The number of people prosecuted on illegal entry and re-entry charges has declined steadily since 2013, however. Last fiscal year, which began in October and included Trump’s first eight months in office, federal immigration prosecutions fell 14 percent compared to the year before, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.
Those numbers are dropping because illegal crossings themselves have plummeted to the lowest levels seen since the 1970s. A greater share of those who do cross into the United States are people who say they are fleeing the violence-plagued Central American countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.
Before Trump took office, it was not unknown for people to face prosecution for immigration violations. OutletName observed at least three cases in October 2016 for a report about such prosecutions.
But the authors of the HRF report contend that the phenomenon is becoming more common under the Trump administration, which has criticized the asylum system and urged prosecutors to prioritize immigration prosecutions, even as illegal crossings drop.
In April, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued guidance to all 94 U.S. attorneys asking them to prosecute illegal re-entry charges more aggressively. (Anyone with a deportation on his or her record can be charged with illegal re-entry, even if the arrest occurs outside the U.S.-Mexico border region.)
Within three months, prosecutors in Tucson, Arizona, had already begun charging dozens of first-time crossers per day with illegal entry misdemeanors ― a practice the court had not seen in years. Prior to Sessions’ directive, prosecutors in the Tucson area had usually only filed criminal charges against people who had been caught crossing illegally in the past.
Sessions has also criticized U.S. asylum laws, claiming that Central American migrants game the system.",1
572,"The nation’s new pro-American immigration policies will help Mexicans as well as Americans, President Donald Trump told the nation today.
“It is going to be very, very good for Mexico,” he told a cheering audience at the headquarters of the Department of Homeland Security. “Our relationship with Mexico is going to get better and better,” he said Jan. 25, shortly after he signed orders ending a series of pro-migration policies established by President Barack Obama.
Trump’s emphasis on the benefits to both Americans and Mexicans flips the standard script pushed by progressives who argue that Trump’s pro-American policies are motivated by hostility towards foreigners, including Mexicans and Central Americans.
At the DHS, standing beside Gen. John Kelly, the new DHS chief, Trump declared:
The unprecedented surge of illegal migrants from Central America is harming both Mexico and the United States, and I believe these steps … starting right now, will improve the safety in both countries … A nation without a border is not a nation.
The policy of firm borders will be used to increase “economic opportunity on both sides” of the border, Trump said, after describing the northward flow of drugs and criminals.
“I want to emphasize that we will be working in a partnership with our friends in Mexico to improve safety and economic opportunity on both sides of the border,” he said, adding “I have deep admiration or the people of Mexico.”
He continued:
We are going to save lives on both sides of the border, and we also understand that a strong and healthy economy in Mexico is very good for the United States. Very, very good. We want that to happen.
Trump’s support for Mexicans living in Mexico is popular among his supporters.
Thirty-three percent of Trump supporters have a positive view of Mexican immigrants in the United States — but 75 percent of his supporters also have a positive view of “Mexicans living in Mexico,” according to an October 2016 survey. That positive view of Mexicans-in-Mexico is shared by 80 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of all Americans, and 82 percent of Democrats, leaving Trump’s supporters with similar generous attitudes as other Americans towards foreigners living in their own countries.
Trump’s new pro-border policies are furiously opposed by globalist progressives.
“President Trump’s fantasy of sealing the border with a wall is driven by racial and ethnic bias that disgraces America’s proud tradition of protecting vulnerable migrants,” claimed Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. Jadwat continued, according to a ACLU statement:
The DHS deportation force has a track record of racial profiling and excessive force abuses, and expanding it will further erode the rights of millions of people who call our safe border communities home. Locking up asylum seekers who pose no danger or flight risk is unconstitutional and benefits nobody except private prison corporations and politicians looking to score rhetorical points. We will see the Trump administration in court if they go down that road.
Pro-American immigration reformers, however, welcomed Trump’s new policies, even as they also called for action to curb many other pro-migrant policies established by Obama.
Top of the list is a law requiring companies to check that possible hires are allowed to work in the United States.
The reformers also want Trump to deploy a visitor-tracking system so that officials know when legal visitors, such as tourists or temporary workers, have left the country. The system would help reduce the number of “overstay” illegal workers. Congress has repeatedly authorized the deployment of the tracking system since the 9/11 atrocity, but has not provided the needed funds. In 2015 roughly 500,000 foreign visitors overstayed their visas, according to a government report.
The reformers also want Trump to reverse Obama regulations which sharply increased the inflow of foreign while-collar professionals who compete for professional jobs sought by young American graduates.
Trump is coming under criticism from pro-American immigration reformers for not immediately stopping the renewal of two-year work permits given to roughly 750,000 illegal immigrants by Obama’s 2012 quasi-amnesty.
Throughout his term, Obama increased the inflow of legal immigrants so much that his agencies brought one migrant into the United States for every two births during the first half of 2016, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. For much of his tenure, Obama’s agencies annually imported one million new legal immigrants plus one million foreign contract workers, even as 4 million young Americans annually entered the job market. By a lopsided margin, most Americans believe companies should hire Americans before hiring additional immigrants.
Trump’s pro-American policies are mostly opposed by business groups and by many GOP leaders, especially House Speaker Paul Ryan. The GOP’s leadership tend to favor a business-friendly high-immigration, low-wage economic strategy. For example, Ryan has repeatedly argued that business needs a steady supply of foreign blue-collar workers and white-collar professionals about the four million Americans who join the labor force each year, and that foreign workers are needed to prevent any wage increases for American workers.
The current inflow of cheap foreign workers cuts’ Americans salaries and effectively transfers roughly $500 billion a year from pay packets into investors’ profits, according to calculations by Professor George Borjas, a Harvard researcher.

831,"U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials closed the San Ysidro port of entry in the wake of several hundred migrants who tried to storm the border between Tijuana, Mexico and the San Diego area on Sunday afternoon.
Tear gas was fired at the oncoming migrants from the U.S. side, OutletName reports, and the migrant group — comprised of mostly men — dispersed in less than an hour.
ITV correspondent Emma Murphy posted several videos via Twitter that included migrants storming the port of entry, border patrol helicopters flying overhead, and a group shouting “yes, we can!” Hundreds try to storm the border. Expect significant US response #tijuana Us military helicopters all over Mexican side of border now. Normal protocol bars this. Some pushing right to fence shouting “yes we can”. Though the group storming the border were mostly comprised of men, Murphy posted video of several families with children attempting to climb a railway siding to gain entry another way.

Port normally sees 70,000 cars pass over daily. — Anna Giaritelli (_Giaritelli) November 25, 2018
President Trump earlier Sunday called for Mexico to stop oncoming caravans long before they get to the United States border, blaming the problem on Democrats in a Sunday tweet.
“Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border, or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U.S. No longer),” Trump tweeted. “Dems created this problem. No crossings!”",0
1045,"The Supreme Court took no action today on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, signaling that if the justices were to take up the case, it would only hear arguments next term.
What that means: That leaves in place (for now) protections for some 700,000 recipients of the program for at least the next several months.
What this has to do with the shutdown: The court’s inaction is a loss for the Trump administration, which had asked for the justices to take up the issue this fall. It comes as the Trump administration has tried to exchange protections in exchange for a border wall.
On Saturday, Trump proposed a new plan to end the government shutdown, offering a three-year reprieve from deportation to undocumented migrants covered by DACA in exchange for $5.7 billion in wall funding.",1
182,"A 32-year-old is suing San Francisco, alleging that the city violated its sanctuary city ordinance by reporting him to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after reporting his car stolen in 2015.
Pedro Figueroa Zarceno, who is from El Salvador and lives in the Mission District, was in federal immigration custody for two months. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that it is prohibited in the city to use local resources to help federal law enforcement.
“With an incoming federal administration threatening mass deportations and targeting sanctuary cities, we must hold SFPD and the Sheriff’s Department accountable and ensure that every single officer is following the city’s due process protections,” Saira Hussain, an attorney representing Figueroa, told the paper.
The suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court, seeks an unspecified amount and calls on police to admit that he was a “victim of false imprisonment.”
A spokesman from the city reportedly said that San Francisco has “strong policies in place to encourage victims and witnesses to report crimes without fear of being deported.” The report pointed out that in February, then-Police Chief Greg Suhr acknowledged that the man should not have ended up in custody.
The report said that Figueroa reported the car stolen in November 2015.
Authorities eventually found the car, and when he filled out the paper work to pick up the car, he was arrested.
Homeland Security told the paper that police ran the background check and learned that he had a 10-year-old, outstanding warrant for deportation after failing to appear at an immigration hearing in Texas in 2005, and a 2012 conviction for drunken driving, authorities told the paper.
His attorneys told the paper that he planned to file for asylum and intended to go through the hearing process. He reportedly did not hear from authorities about the matter again. And his attorneys told the paper he had no idea there was an outstanding warrant.",0
701,"Republican Virginia gubernatorial candidate Corey Stewart is upping the pressure against primary opponent Ed Gillespie and warning that a Gillespie victory “pushes back progress we made in 2016.”
Republican primary voters head to polls on June 13 and Gillespie holds a double-digit lead in public polling. The most recent public poll has Gillespie ahead with 38 percent and Stewart at 18 percent, with 24 percent of voters undecided. Stewart, who chaired President Donald Trump’s Virginia campaign before being sacked over a dispute with the Republican National Committee, told reporters Wednesday to disregard the polls.
“There is a major weakness in the polls, we haven’t had a Republican primary since 2005 so nobody knows who is going to vote,” Stewart, the at-large chairman of Prince William County, said.
The Washington Post reported Monday that Gillespie’s lobbying firm was paid more than $1 million in 2001 by Tyson Foods to help with federal charges regarding smuggling illegal Mexican immigrants to work at its facilities. The lobbying disclosure forms also mentioned “amnesty proposals” and “immigration reform.”
In his response to the Post report, the former RNC chairman Gillespie said he didn’t recall working for Tyson and a spokesman for the food giant put out a statement that said they retained Gillespie’s firm for “public affairs consulting, not lobbying.”
Tyson was acquitted of the criminal charges, but admitted that there was some smuggling of illegal immigrants. Stewart has pounced on this and said at a campaign event,”Ed Gillespie is complicit in smuggling illegal aliens into this country. He’s complicit in human trafficking.”
A spokesman for Gillespie’s campaign responded to this by accusing Stewart’s campaign of having a “a constant stream of fabrication and falsehoods.”
Stewart has focused on this charge and filmed a video for Facebook Live Wednesday outside the Washington office of Quinn, Gillespie & Associates “to discuss The Washington Post’s bombshell article about Ed’s complicity in human trafficking.”
He told reporters this accusation wasn’t going too far as Gillespie had came out in support of the 2013 “Gang of 8” immigration bill that would have given illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.
Stewart has worked to implement anti-illegal immigrant measures at the local level and it has been a main issue on the campaign trail for him. He has also campaigned on “Virginia history,” which is how he refers to his defense of Confederate monuments around the state.
Stewart told reporters a victory by former Bush staffer Gillespie would push back on “progress we made in 2016 of shoving out the establishment.”",0
319,"There are now more illegal aliens giving birth to anchor babies in the Los Angeles, California metro area than there are total United States births in 14 states and the District of Columbia. New wide-ranging analysis by the Center for Immigration Studies‘ Steven Camarotta reveals that there are an estimated 28,000 births to illegal aliens every year in the Los Angeles metro area, exceeding the total number of U.S. births in 14 states and the District of Columbia. The children of illegal aliens are commonly known as “anchor babies,” as they anchor their illegal alien and noncitizen parents in the U.S. and eventually are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country through the process known as “chain migration.” About 1-in-5 U.S. births — or 791,000 — are to legal and illegal immigrant mothers, with legal immigrant mothers accounting for about 12.4 percent of those births and illegal alien mothers accounting for 7.5 percent. In the Los Angeles, California metro area, illegal alien births make up nearly 18 percent of all births in the region. In the Las Vegas, Nevada metro area, illegal alien births account for about 17 percent of all births. California — a sanctuary state for illegal aliens — has the largest number of illegal alien births with about 65,000 illegal alien births every year. Texas has about 51,000 illegal alien births every year, while Florida has about 16,000 illegal alien births every year. There are an estimated 12 million illegal aliens living across the U.S. at any given time. Most recent research by Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, however, revealed that there is likely an estimated 22 million illegal aliens in the U.S. Additionally, every year, 1.5 million legal immigrants are admitted to the country.",0
768,"President Trump pushed the wall while Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer hit the ceiling.
That’s the short version of the dueling prime time television addresses.
The Democratic arguments for obstructing President Trump rather than the growing flood of migrants don’t stand up to scrutiny.
Let’s go through them one by one.
When Democrats say walls don’t work, they must be having a flashback on the Blue Wall that was supposed to protect Hillary in 2016, the one that Donald J. Trump breached in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Ohio.
That as we know didn’t work at all.
But Nancy Pelosi says she wants another virtual wall. She says she’ll fund new technology and innovation. But a virtual wall won’t work any better on the southern border than the blue wall did around the Great Lakes.
Our source on this is that notorious alt-right publication, the Washington Post. The kooks at the Post report that the government’s attempt in 2006 to build 28 miles of a high-tech virtual border wall known as SBInet, Secure Border Initiative Net, using sensors, radar and cameras failed miserably.
In all fairness, SBInet did succeed in transferring a billion tax dollars to a defense contractor whose employees gave generously to Democratic candidates this last cycle.
The Government Accountability Office declared, “Had the money spent on SBInet been spent instead on building a wall on the border, it could have covered 73 miles.”
It’s not like the Democrats don’t know about this. Former Democratic Rep. Dave Obey of Wisconsin helped expose the high-tech border wall boondoggle when he chaired the appropriations committee the last time Nancy Pelosi was speaker.
But instead of relying on the record, the facts and her failing memory, Nancy Pelosi stubbornly clings to the fantasy of a Star Wars force field at the border.
Nancy and Chuck kept saying the wall is ineffective wasteful and unnecessary. Which may be the first time in history Democrats worried about wasting taxpayers’ money. Then-Speaker Pelosi didn’t ask Boeing to give taxpayers back the $1 billion wasted on the virtual border wall that never worked.
Rep. Jerold Nadler, the new chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said nothing after we gave somewhere between $50 billion to $150 billion, including $1.7 billion in cash, to Iran following his vote to approve the Iran nuclear deal.
When it comes to effectiveness, real, as opposed to virtual, walls have a pretty good record despite what the anti-wall dead-enders want us to believe. I direct your attention to any number of embassies, consulates (including one in Benghazi), federal buildings and private homes, including President Obama’s, that have walls.
One reason we’re supposed to believe walls don’t work is — get ready for this — they are old, really old! This is, like, so age-ist! I mean, Chuck Schumer is old, but he works. Sometimes I wish he didn’t, but it’s not because he’s old.
I understand some Americans have a cult-like belief that anything new is automatically better. That’s why we buy the latest smartphone and will tell Alexa to turn the microwave on even though she may be reporting everything we say to Jeff Bezos. Call me old fashioned, but I know my stockade fence does a great job keeping people off my lawn, and the law requires me to have a fence around my pool to keep kids from drowning.
Then there’s the appeal to morality. Nancy says a wall doesn’t honor our values and declares it is “an immorality.” This is coming from the same person who doesn’t want government lecturing us about the morality of what her constituents are doing on the streets and between the sheets in San Francisco.
If I want a lecture on morality, I’ll call my preacher, not a member of Congress. We can debate whether the pope is infallible on matters of faith and morals, but there’s no question politicians aren’t. These are the same folks best remembered for hiding cash in the freezer, taking bribes in FBI sting operations and selling their votes and influence to the highest bidder.
Politicians are best known for being all talk and no action, and Chuck Schumer is all in on that count.
He said we can re-open the government and continue the debate over border security — for another 30 years!
The Democrats hit the wall with their arguments. And they were stopped.",0
320,"A South Texas rancher notified Laredo Sector Border Patrol agents after finding the remains of a deceased migrant nearly 50 miles from the Mexican border. Agents assigned to the Hebbronville Station received a call from a rancher whose property is located west of the town of Hebbronville, Texas, on Texas Highway 359. The agents responded to the scene along with a Webb County Medical Examiner’s Office death investigator, according to information obtained from Laredo Sector Border Patrol officials. The Border Patrol agents and the death investigator examined the remains and searched the area for clues as to the migrant’s identity. They found no documents or any other evidence about the nationality or identity of the deceased migrant.

The Border Patrol agents and the death investigator examined the remains and searched the area for clues as to the migrant’s identity.

Human smugglers, often connected to Mexican cartels, use ranches to march migrants around the immigration checkpoint. When one of the migrants becomes injured, dehydrated, overheated, or otherwise cannot keep up, the smuggler leaves them behind where they frequently die. Laredo Sector agents found the remains of another deceased migrant earlier this week on a ranch near Rio Bravo, Texas, OutletName News reported on Sunday. In nearby Brooks County, agents and sheriff’s office deputies recently recovered the bodies of two more migrants during a five day period. Officials suspect one of the migrants to be a Honduran national because of currency found in his pants. The second body belonged to a 34-year-old woman from Mexico. Her sister identified her body after Border Patrol agents apprehended her elsewhere on the ranch located on the west side of Brooks County. The sister told Border Patrol agents she saw their “guide” give her sister two pills after she became too weak to keep up with the group. The woman passed out a short time later and the human smuggler forced the group to leave her behind to die. The death toll for migrants who illegally crossed the border from Mexico into Texas now stands at 211, according to the International Organization for Migrants’ Missing Migrant Project. At least 348 migrants died during or shortly after illegal border crossings all along the U.S.-Mexico Border.",0
1797,"A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection declined to provide information about the encounter or to comment on the lawsuit, which also names Mr. O’Neal, the acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin K. McAleenan and 25 unnamed “John Doe” defendants the A.C.L.U. said were involved in the episode.
“As a matter of policy, U.S. Customs and Border Protection does not comment on pending litigation,” Jason Givens, an agency spokesman, said in an email. “However, lack of comment should not be construed as agreement or stipulation with any of the allegations.”
Efforts to locate Mr. O’Neal on Thursday evening were not immediately successful.
In a statement, the A.C.L.U. said that it was unconstitutional for law enforcement or immigration agents to detain people because of their language, accent or race. Cody Wofsy, a lawyer with the organization’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said he saw the case “as a part of a broader pattern of abusive conduct by an out-of-control agency.”
“This is an opportunity for the courts to step in and say there are constitutional limits on what C.B.P. can do,” he said. “This is certainly nothing new based on what we have seen over the last couple of years of the Trump administration. The agency has been emboldened to act on some of its worst impulses.”
The case highlights concern over the far-reaching power of Customs and Border Protection, whose agents have the authority to detain and question people up to 100 miles from an international border, a vast area that is home to almost two-thirds of the population of the United States.
Havre, a remote farm city of about 9,000 people, is home to a Customs and Border Protection field office with 183 agents who have jurisdiction over more than 450 miles of the Canadian border. The city is about 35 miles from the border.
In 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that border agents illegally detained five Latino men in Havre in 2004 and said that “apparent Hispanic ethnicity, although a relevant factor in the reasonable suspicion inquiry, cannot by itself justify an investigatory stop in a border area.”",1
953,"Mexico is pushing back against the Trump administration’s new immigration directives that could have dramatic implications for the United States’ southern neighbor, as top US officials come to visit the country. Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said his country is worried about recent actions that could greatly expand US deportations of undocumented immigrants, including sending non-Mexicans to Mexico. “I want to make it clear, in the most emphatic way, that the Mexican government and the people of Mexico do not have to accept measures unilaterally imposed on a government by another government,” Videgaray said. He spoke just hours before Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly arrived in Mexico for meetings on security, immigration, trade and the border with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and other officials, the bulk of which take place on Thursday. President Donald Trump’s rhetoric and policies have cranked up the tension in US-Mexico relations to a high not seen in decades. He’s blamed the country for sending rapists into the US, castigated undocumented immigrants from across the border and blasted Mexico for what he says are unfair trade practices. One of Trump’s first actions as president was to order the construction of a border wall that he insists Mexico will pay for, despite the country’s repeated refusals. On Tuesday, the Trump administration issued guidance on deportations that could apply to every undocumented immigrant in the US and enable state and local law enforcement to act as immigration officers. Another change to asylum procedures would make it easier for immigration officers to send non-Mexican migrants to Mexico if they came through the country on their way to the US. The change could potentially send tens of thousands of Central Americans fleeing violence, gangs and drug cartels back into Mexico, an issue Kelly and Tillerson will almost certainly have to address. A Mexican official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic matters, said that Pena Nieto, Videgaray and other officials will make clear to Kelly and Tillerson that Mexico will not take deportees who are not Mexican nationals. A second Mexican official emphasized that Mexico is not bound by a US presidential order and said there’s nothing the US can do to force the issue. This official pointed out that there is no bilateral agreement between the US and Mexico on having to take these immigrants. This official said that for more than two years, Mexico has been stopping Central American migrants before they reach the US – and added that this is one of the pieces of leverage they have. If Trump doesn’t stop these “orders,” it will make it more difficult for Mexico to continue this cooperation, the official said.  Speaking in Guatemala Wednesday ahead of his visit to Mexico, Kelly said the President has authorized DHS to “protect and gain control” of US borders and “emphasized the mission of intercepting irregular immigrants from many countries on our borders, treat them humanely and return them to their countries of origin as fast as possible.” He also said that Trump has authorized more resources – detention facilities, border patrol agents and construction of a physical barrier “where it makes sense.” The first Mexican official said that his country’s senior leaders want to see a demonstration of “the respect that the relationship deserves, built over decades.” They’re also be looking for acknowledgment that Mexico is one of the US’s biggest trading partners, on which millions of jobs depend, and that the US “is lucky to have such good neighbors.” Tillerson and Kelly will be bringing exactly that message, according to administration officials who briefed reporters about the visit anonymously. Tillerson, who expressed respect for Mexico in his Senate confirmation hearing and who met with Videgaray on February 2, his first day on the job, will build on that initial conversation, a State Department official said. “We expect the visit to be forward-looking and to discuss ways to strengthen our cooperation in order to advance the security and economic well-being of our two peoples,” the official said. Tillerson’s visit will be “the first in what we envision will be a close, ongoing working relationship with Mexico.” Asked about the tensions between Mexico and the US, the State Department official responded, “We have a long history of cooperation,” and referred to a phone call between Trump and Pena Nieto. “The two presidents reiterated their desire to continue to build upon that in the phone conversation, acknowledging that we have some differences on specific issues,” the official continued. And asked about Trump’s insistence on Mexico covering the cost of the wall, the official said that “we have a clear difference on the payment issue but agree that we need to work these differences out.” Trump has ordered all his Cabinet agencies to inform him of the total direct and indirect aid the US gives Mexico, a move that some see as an attempt to amass some leverage in the debate over the wall. The first Mexican official said that Tillerson and Kelly will receive a clear message to take back to Washington: Mexico will not pay for the wall’s construction. Anger about that proposal is just one factor fueling consumer boycotts of US brands and goods in Mexico, where lawmakers have introduced a bill to stop buying US corn. Mexicans staged massive anti-US protests Sunday, forming human chains along the border where Trump would like to build a wall. Peña Nieto already canceled a trip to Washington to meet with Trump in apparent frustration over the new US leader’s proposals and rhetoric. That anger will complicate Tillerson and Kelly’s meetings with Peña Nieto, Mexican ministers and military officials. The trip is meant to allow the new US Cabinet members to establish relationships and coordinate on bilateral issues that range from counterterrorism, border security, immigration and trade that amounts to $1.5 billion a day. But the secretaries make their debut under a cloud. “Today’s rhetoric is forcing Mexicans everywhere to question the unquestionable: Did the country make a mistake 25 years ago by betting its future on North America?” asked Peter Schecter, director of the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center at the Atlantic Council. “No relationship is perfect, and there is much to develop and improve in Mexico. But by ostracizing our neighbor, we are in imminent danger of dismantling the North American experiment we’ve built over the last 20-plus years.” In a reflection of how broad the US-Mexico relationship is, Tillerson and Kelly will meet with the Mexican ministers of Interior, Foreign Relations, Finance, National Defense and Navy. The trip to Mexico City will represent the first known high-level meetings between the US and Mexican officials since Peña Nieto canceled a visit to Washington on January 27 after Trump declared that there was no point in his coming if Mexico wouldn’t agree to pay for a border wall. “Unless Mexico will treat the US fairly, with respect, such a meeting is fruitless, and I want to go a different route,” Trump told GOP lawmakers at a retreat in Philadelphia. “I have no choice.” He went on to say that “border security is a serious, serious issue and a national problem. Most illegal immigration is coming from our southern border.” The issue of illegal immigration was a major campaign theme for Trump, who framed it as an economic and security challenge threatening the US. One of his first acts as president was to sign two executive orders for construction of a US-Mexico border wall and increasing the number of border patrol officers and immigration enforcement officers who carry out deportations. During the campaign, Trump went to Mexico City to meet Peña Nieto and said he discussed the wall but not who would pay for it – a claim the Mexican president disputed. Peña Nieto took to Twitter after the meeting to say that “I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.” Still, the meeting was a political debacle for the Mexican leader, and the nationalist backlash against Trump is bolstering the political fortunes of leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who Schecter noted now leads national polls on the 2018 election. Trump has also railed against Mexico and the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he has described in tweets as “a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers … of jobs and companies lost” that has created a trade deficit. He has repeatedly said he wants to renegotiate the deal, which many experts agree wouldn’t be a bad thing, given that it was originally written at a time when intellectual property, the Internet and e-commerce weren’t major economic drivers. Schecter pointed out that the economies of the three NAFTA countries – the US, Canada and Mexico – are so intertwined that cross-border production chains “mean 40 cents’ worth and 25 cents’ worth of every dollar we import from Mexico and Canada, respectively, is US content.” “President Trump is right, NAFTA should be updated,” said Schecter. “But not in an atmosphere of recrimination.”",1
423,"President Donald Trump warned Americans that Congressional Democrats were preparing to shut down the government over amnesty for illegal immigrants.
“The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security,” Trump wrote on Twitter.
His comments followed a blowup of a potential DACA amnesty deal with Democrats, which he blamed on “Dicky Durbin” leaking details of a private meeting he had with senators.
Trump warned that a government shutdown would severely hurt the military “at a time we need it more than ever.”
He also called for a merit-based immigration system, a plan to get rid of the lottery visa program, and most importantly the wall on the southern border.
“We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER, and we must have a great WALL to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!” he wrote on Twitter.

77,"Voters in Sweden handed the ruling Social Democrats their worst result in decades Sunday, while the far-right Sweden Democrats were projected to become the third-largest party in Stockholm's parliament. With almost all the ballots counted, the Social Democrats had emerged as the largest party but had just 28.3 percent of the vote, making it likely to lose a significant number of seats. The Moderates party was next at 19.8 percent, followed by the Sweden Democrats at 17.6 percent. That's a 4.6 percent increase in their vote share from the last election, held in 2014. Sunday's results make it unlikely that any party will have a majority of the 175 seats in the Riksdagen, Sweden's parliament. It could take weeks or months of coalition talks before the next government is formed. Both the left-leaning bloc led by the Social Democrats and the center-right bloc have said they would refuse to consider the Sweden Democrats as a potential coalition partner. Sunday's election was the first since the Swedish government in 2015 allowed 163,000 migrants into the Scandinavian country with a population of 10 million. The number was far lower than the asylum-seekers Germany accepted that year, but the highest per capita of any European nation. The Sweden Democrats — led by Jimmie Akesson — worked to soften its neo-Nazi image while helping to break down longstanding taboos on what Swedes could say openly about immigration and integration without being shunned as racists. The potential of a surge by the party had many Swedes worried about an erosion of the humanitarian values that have long been a foundation of their country's identity. ""This election is a referendum about our welfare,"" Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said. ""It's also about decency, about a decent democracy ... and not letting the Sweden Democrats, an extremist party, a racist party, get any influence in the government."" At the party's rally on Saturday, Akesson strongly criticized Lofven's government for ""prioritizing"" the cause of immigrants over the needs of citizens. ""This government we have had now ... they have prioritised, during these four years, asylum-seekers,"" Akesson said, giving an exhaustive list of things he says the government has failed to do for Swedish society because of migrants.",0
8,"Images and videos posted on social media Sunday afternoon showed hundreds of migrants from the leading Central American caravan pushing past Mexican riot police and rushing the border at the port of entry in San Ysidro, Calif., in a major test for both U.S. border authorities and Mexican officials. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said it suspended northbound and southbound crossings for both pedestrians and vehicles at the San Ysidro port of entry at approximately 11:30 a.m. local time. It later tweeted that the pedestrian crossings had re-opened, a little more than four hours after the initial closure. The vehicle lanes re-opened at approximately 5 p.m. local time, five-and-a-half hours after they were closed. CBP added that some demonstrators ""attempted to illegally enter the U.S. through both the northbound and southbound vehicle lanes at the port of entry itself. Those persons were stopped and turned back to Mexico."" 
U.S. border agents shot several rounds of tear gas after some migrants attempted to penetrate various points along the border and threw what appeared to be rocks at U.S. authorities. Mexico's Milenio TV showed images of migrants climbing over fences and peeling back metal sheeting to enter. Tear gas fumes were carried by the wind toward people who were hundreds of feet away, including some children. Honduran Ana Zuniga, 23, also said she saw migrants opening a small hole in concertina wire at a gap on the Mexican side of a levee, at which point U.S. agents fired tear gas at them. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement that some migrants ""attempted to breach legacy fence infrastructure along the border and sought to harm CBP personnel by throwing projectiles at them. ""As I have continually stated, DHS will not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons,"" Nielsen said. ""We will also seek to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who destroys federal property, endangers our frontline operators, or violates our nation’s sovereignty."" The Mexican Interior Ministry said Sunday afternoon it would immediately deport the migrants who tried to ""violently"" breach the border. The Mexican government described Sunday's events as ""acts of provocation"" that were ""far from helpful"" for the migrants' objectives. Earlier this month, President Trump said that troops stationed at the border would treat thrown rocks like ""firearms."" ""We're not going to put up with that,"" the president said. ""They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. I told them to consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks, like they did at the Mexico military and police, I said, consider it a rifle."" The situation Sunday was not unprecedented. In 2013, during the Obama administration, Border Patrol agents used pepper spray to fend off a crowd of approximately 100 migrants who attempted to rush the San Ysidro port of entry. The migrants in that episode also reportedly threw rocks and bottles at U.S. authorities. Within an hour on Sunday, the group from the caravan that rushed toward the border largely dispersed. Most of the migrants in the group were men. OutletName had confirmed early Sunday through an organizer for Pueblo Sin Fronteras, the group helping organize the leading Central American migrant caravan, that members of the caravan were planning to attempt to cross the port of entry at San Ysidro later in the day. Footage posted by ITV correspondent Emma Murphy also showed several U.S. Border Patrol helicopters reportedly flying low overhead on the Mexican side of the border. In anticipation of the planned migrant effort, U.S. authorities said they had deployed additional personnel to the San Ysidro port of entry on Sunday, including Air and Marine agents. Other video showed migrants pushing toward a border fence chanting, ""Yes we can."" The dramatic escalation at the border came as Mexico's incoming government denied reports Saturday that it had struck a deal with the White House to keep asylum-seekers in the country while their claims move through U.S. immigration courts. President Trump, for his part, again threatened to close the entire southern border if no deal could be reached between the two counties. On Saturday, the first episode of caravan-related violence directed at U.S. authorities was reported by U.S. Border Patrol in Arizona, as a 31-year-old Honduran man who apparently split off from the caravan threw rocks at agents and a helicopter after setting a tree on fire. The prospective deal between the U.S. and Mexico was seen as a way to dissuade thousands of Central American migrants from seeking asylum in the U.S., a process that can take years. The legal bar for claiming asylum is high and generally requires applicants to show a specific risk of persecution based on factors such as race, nationality, politics or religion. Trump administration officials have characterized the vast majority of asylum claims as fraudulent or legally insufficient, and have taken steps to reduce the backlog of asylum claims that they say are often used by migrants to gain entry into the U.S. and disappear into the country as their claims are adjudicated. ""There is no agreement of any sort between the incoming Mexican government and the U.S. government,"" future Interior Minister Olga Sanchez said in a statement. Hours earlier, The Washington Post quoted her as saying that the incoming administration of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had agreed to allow migrants to stay in Mexico as a ""short-term solution"" while the U.S. considered their applications for asylum. Lopez Obrador will take office on Dec. 1. The newspaper also quoted Sanchez as saying: ""For now, we have agreed to this policy of Remain in Mexico.""  Sanchez did not explain in the statement why The Washington Post had quoted her as saying there had been an agreement. Early Sunday, Trump wrote on Twitter that it would be ""very SMART"" for Mexico to ""stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border"" to avoid future logistics challenges at the border.
There were signs last week that the Mexican government has received that message. Mexican immigration agents on Wednesday detained almost all of the Central American migrants on a fourth caravan that recently entered Mexico seeking to reach the U.S., with Mexico's National Immigration Institute saying 213 migrants were detained and taken to a processing center. Those found to lack proper documents may face repatriation to their home countries. Other administration officials sounded notes of optimism despite the apparent confusion on how to handle the migrants. ""President Trump has developed a strong relationship with the incoming [Lopez] Obrador administration, and we look forward to working with them on a wide range of issues,"" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said over the weekend. Approximately 5,000 Central American migrants have arrived in recent days to Tijuana, just south of California, after making their way through Mexico via caravan. But agents at the San Diego port of entry process fewer than 100 claims per day. On Friday, the mayor of Tijuana declared a humanitarian crisis in his border city of 1.6 million people,  saying he was asking the United Nations for aid to deal with the approximately 5,000 Central American migrants, most of whom were camped out inside a sports complex. The comments by Mayor Juan Manuel Gastelum came as city officials and volunteers worked together to assist the 4,976 men, women and children who had arrived after more than a month on the road. Tijuana declares humanitarian crisis amid caravan arrivalVideo
Hundreds of Tijuana residents have protested their arrival, complaining that recent caravans forced their way into Mexico from Guatemala. Trump threatened Thursday, and again on Saturday, to shut down the border crossing entirely if his administration determines that Mexico has lost ""control"" of the situation in Tijuana. Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin, described the Remain in Mexico plan as a strategy to take away the ability of migrants to live and work in the U.S. while cases are processed. ""The hope is that asylum seekers will not want to live in [Mexico] for months/years and won't come,"" Leutert wrote on Twitter. She added: ""The big question is why would Mexico agree to this? ... Mexico has its own migratory enforcement interests and the various caravans have been a huge headache."" U.S. officials have said for months that they were working with Mexico on possible proposals. One variation, called ""Safe Third,"" would have denied asylum claims on the grounds that asylum seekers had found haven in Mexico. President Enrique Pena Nieto offered thousands of Central Americans asylum on Oct. 26 if they agreed to remain in southern Mexico. Close to 3,000 migrants took Mexico up on the offer. Sanchez said Saturday that the next government does not plan for Mexico to become a ""Safe Third"" country. Julieta Vences, a congresswoman with Lopez Obrador's Morena party who is also president of Mexico's congressional migrant affairs commission, told the AP that incoming Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard has been discussing with U.S. officials how to handle a deluge of asylum claims at the border. ""They're going to have to open the borders (for the migrants) to put in the request,"" Vences said. ""They will also give us dates, on what terms they will receive the (asylum) requests and in the case that they are not beneficiaries of this status, they will have to return here,"" Vences said. She said Mexico needs to examine how to accommodate the migrants without angering locals. ""When they come back, we need to see how ... we can integrate them into an economic activity so that they can develop and not generate conflict with our own communities."" Local churches and charities have been feeding the migrants, with assistance from state and federal agencies. They also have distributed thousands of blankets, thin mattresses and personal hygiene kits.",0
1198,"The Trump administration has resumed receiving renewal applications for individuals eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
In a statement posted Saturday , the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said the DACA program will be operated ""on the terms in place"" before it was rescinded last September.
""Due to a federal court order, USCIS has resumed accepting requests to renew a grant of deferred action under DACA,"" the statement said.
The agency said it won't be processing applications for those who have never before received DACA protections and no new applications will be accepted.
The announcement comes days after a federal judge in California temporarily blocked the Trump administration's efforts to end DACA. The program protected young undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children from deportation.",1
902,"Will hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants lose protection from deportation? That decision is up to Congress, the Trump administration says. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in September that the administration was rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Pulling the plug on DACA overturns President Barack Obama’s signature immigration policy and could upend the lives of more than 700,000 people. But the Trump administration gave Congress a window to act before any currently protected individuals lose their ability to work, study and live without fear in the US. Here’s a look at some key questions about the program and its future: Who’s been protected by DACA?
These are undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, a group often described as Dreamers. About 690,000 young adults are currently protected under the DACA program and officials are processing more than 34,000 additional first-time applications, according to the latest government figures. To be eligible, applicants had to have arrived in the US before age 16 and have lived there since June 15, 2007. They could not have been older than 30 when the Department of Homeland Security enacted the policy in 2012. Among the accepted applicants, Mexico is by far the biggest country of origin, followed by El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. What does DACA do for them?
DACA recipients have been able to come out of the shadows and obtain valid driver’s licenses, enroll in college and legally secure jobs. They also pay income taxes. The program didn’t give them a path to become US citizens or even legal permanent residents – something immigrant rights advocates have criticized, saying it left people in limbo. How long does the deferral last?
Under DACA, Dreamers were able to apply to defer deportation and legally reside in the US for two years. After that, they could apply for renewal. The Trump administration put an end to new DACA applications in September and accepted renewal applications for another month. Now officials say they aren’t accepting any more applications. But they say they’ll consider requests from residents of the hurricane-ravaged US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on a case-by-case basis. That means if Congress doesn’t act, starting March 6, as many as 983 undocumented people could lose their protected status every day – nearly 30,000 people a month, on average, for two years – as DACA recipients’ permits start to expire. So what’s the administration planning to do?
The Trump administration says it’s phasing out DACA in a way that will provide “minimum disruption.” For current DACA recipients, protections remain in effect – for now. According to officials: • Work permits issued under DACA will be honored until they expire. • New DACA applications that were received by September 5 and renewal applications received by October 5 will be processed. What has Trump said about DACA? When it comes to talking about Dreamers and DACA, Trump has been all over the map. He vowed to dismantle the program on the campaign trail, but once he took office he suggested he might take a softer stance. Even after his administration announced its plans to end the program, Trump seemed to signal a desire for Congress to step in and save it, tweeting: “Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really!” But the White House also has released an aggressive list of priorities for any deal to protect DACA recipients – a list that could make a deal almost impossible to reach if it is strictly followed. The administration is already sending mixed messages about how intensely it’s getting behind the list of priorities, and most players on Capitol Hill are taking a wait-and-see approach. Is there any hope now for Dreamers?
Some lawmakers have proposed a bipartisan measure that could protect Dreamers from deportation now that the Trump administration is ending DACA. A pair of Senate Republicans also have unveiled a proposal that they call a conservative approach to protecting DACA recipients. But a number of past efforts to protect the Dreamers – widely seen as the most sympathetic group of undocumented immigrants – have stalled in Congress, and it’s unclear whether a new initiative would be able to gather the momentum it needs to pass. Why did the Trump administration decide to end DACA?
Over the summer, 10 state attorneys general wrote to the President asking him to end DACA and giving him a September 5 ultimatum. Their message: Rescind DACA, or get prepared for a legal challenge from us. The move was praised by groups who advocate for stricter immigration controls, who have long decried DACA as executive overreach and argued that it is akin to providing amnesty for lawbreakers. Immigrant rights activists had said the attorneys general gave Trump what amounted to a false deadline, calling on the administration to stand its ground and keep the program in place. But in September, Trump administration officials said their hands were tied. They described the program as unconstitutional and something they could not successfully defend in court. Why are people called Dreamers?
The term Dreamers comes from the proposed DREAM Act, which offered legal status in return for attending college or joining the military. It was first introduced in 2001. The latest version was voted down in the Senate in December 2010. But the name stuck. And now that the Trump administration has decided to end DACA, you can expect to hear it coming up again in the halls of Congress. What information and fees were required for DACA?
DACA applicants had to provide evidence they were living in the United States at the prescribed times, proof of education and confirmation of their identities. They also had to pass background, fingerprint and other checks that look at identifying biological features. The fee to request consideration of deferred action for childhood arrivals, including employment authorization and biometric services, was $495. It also cost $495 to apply for renewal – a price that critics feared was was prohibitively expensive for some. Could this information be used against Dreamers now that the program is ending?
This is something immigrant rights advocates say they’re very concerned about and they’ve vowed to take steps to prevent it from happening. A Department of Homeland Security official has said all the information provided to the government by DACA applicants will remain in the department’s system. US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers the program, will give that information to ICE if requested “where there’s a significant law enforcement or national security interest,” the official said. Where do I find out more about DACA?
There are answers to more complex questions on the website of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The Department of Homeland Security has also posted answers to a list of questions about its plans to rescind the program.",1
2037,"Late last month, Sen. Thom Tillis declared he would be part of a cadre of GOP senators willing to make a rare break with President Donald Trump to vote against the national emergency he declared to achieve his prized southern border wall.
Enough Republicans stuck to their guns Thursday to pass the resolution that seeks to block Trump’s declaration. But Tillis, a North Carolinian who had loudly gone public with his opposition to the president’s move, was not among them. In a flip-flop that gained much attention, Tillis stayed in Trump’s camp and voted against the measure.
In a floor speech, the freshman lawmaker stressed the “crisis” theme that Trump has touted for his change of heart. But others saw political expediency at work.
“We have to recognize that we have a crisis at the border ― 76,000 people crossing illegally in February alone,” Tillis said in his speech. “We have narcotics flooding our country.”
A dozen Senate Republicans ended up joining all the chamber’s Democrats in approving the resolution. With the House having passed it last week, it goes to the president’s desk. Trump reiterated that he would veto it ― a first for his presidency.
Sen. Thom Tillis, who won his seat in a tight race in 2014, faces a potentially tough re-election battle in 2020.
In a statement after the vote, Tillis expressed confidence that steps would be taken to stop “a future left-wing president” from using the same emergency authority Trump is exercising on the border issue to address matters such as climate change or gun violence. He also cited what he called Trump’s “historic commitment” to amend the emergency declaration law to prevent future abuse of it as a reason he changed his mind.
“The concerns I’ve raised were never about what President Trump is trying to accomplish but rather with setting a precedent that a future Democratic president would exploit to bypass Congress to implement policies well outside the mainstream,” Tillis said in his statement.
He was singing a dramatically different tune just about two weeks ago, however, when he warned in a splashy Washington Post op-ed that it would be hypocritical of Republicans to back Trump’s national emergency declaration after vehemently and often criticizing President Barack Obama for bypassing Congress in implementing policies on immigration and other contentious issues.
“Conservatives rightfully cried foul” when Obama “used executive action to completely bypass Congress and unilaterally provide deferred action (on deportation) to undocumented adults who had knowingly violated the nation’s immigration laws,” Tillis wrote. “Some prominent Republicans went so far as to proclaim that Obama was acting more like an ‘emperor’ or ‘king’ than a president.”
He said: “There is no intellectual honesty in now turning around and arguing that there’s an imaginary asterisk attached to executive overreach — that it’s acceptable for my party but not thy party.”
Tillis is facing a potentially tough re-election fight in 2020. Amid anger among conservative activists sparked by his op-ed, momentum was gathering for a primary challenge targeting Tillis, with some urging Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.) to take him on. Tillis’ about-face in Thursday’s vote could cool some of this discontent.
Democrats also see Tillis’ seat as offering them a prime pickup opportunity in a year when they are setting their sights on winning a Senate majority. Possible Democratic candidates include Anthony OutletNamex, a former mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, who served as Transportation secretary under Obama.
Tillis “made a big show about how he’d stand up for North Carolina but caved under pressure,” North Carolina Democratic Party spokesman Robert Howard said in a statement after the vote on the emergency declaration. “Tillis again reminded the entire state who he is: a spineless politician who won’t keep his promises and looks out for himself instead of North Carolina.”
Several political commentators weighed in On Twitter on Tillis’ vote:
I wonder why Tillis changed his mind about the constitution ... ://t.co/ucYjyQyhQg pic.twitter.com/K302tMjvx2 — Matt Lewis () March 14, 2019

64,"The heated immigration debate in Washington is shining a spotlight on a World War II-era agreement that allowed millions of Mexican immigrants to work in the U.S. as guest workers. The Bracero Program grew out of a series of bilateral agreements between Mexico and the United States that allowed Mexicans to come to the U.S. to work from 1942 through 1964 under short-term, agricultural labor contracts. “Bracero” loosely translates to “manual laborer.” The program was debated during a summit Friday and Saturday at the University of Texas at El Paso, hosted by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. “There were bosses that were stricter than others. Some treated braceros very harshly, others did not,” said Francisco Uvina, who was a bracero for seven years. Uvina described his time working on cotton fields to OutletName through a translator. “Braceros suffered a lot back then. Long nights. Picking while bent over. Hard work. Personally, I didn’t have a boss that treated me badly, but other braceros did. They would be taken advantage of,” said Uvina. The first men crossed the border 75 years ago this September. That’s when braceros started what they said was difficult but worthwhile work for farmers. One historian has said the braceros program was beneficial to many Americans -- but also started the pattern of bringing temporary workers into the U.S. and pushing them out when they’re done. Some braceros also became full-time residents and citizens of the U.S., starting families that are now multiple generations deep. The fate of other programs that currently allow migrants to stay in the U.S., like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, remains up in the air. “In these times when immigration is in the news and it’s so debated and so contested, I think the more that we in the United States know about immigration policy, the better we can actually make decisions,” said Yolinda Leyva, Director of the Institute of Oral History at UTEP. One of today’s closest equivalents to the bracero program would be the H-2A visa, which allows immigrants to work temporary or seasonal agricultural jobs. To qualify, employers must show there are not enough U.S. workers who are able to do the work. But the visa program has its critics. Such temporary work programs “just provide a way for employers to control very low paid work force,” said Leyva. “I think that’s a bad pattern to have. If we want workers we shouldn’t just think of them as temporary people.” In today’s society, a bracero-type program would play a very different role than it did 75 years ago. Machines have replaced many of the jobs braceros used to perform, so farmers need fewer hands for picking, but more skilled hands that are qualified to work machinery. “I probably wouldn’t need more than 10 to 15 max,” said Craige Miller, an owner of the Miller Farm. Miller said he might be interested in a similar program. “I’d have to see what all the requirements would be before I could say yay or nay on the deal.” Miller was a child when he said some 400 braceros worked on his farm. He remembers working alongside braceros, packing cotton into the back of trucks. Miller said they were a big help, back when they picked the cotton by hand. “Harvesting the crop would have been a real challenge without the bracero program,” said Miller. But now Miller picks his cotton with a machine that he says can do as much work in a day as 500 men. Coming to America gave many braceros their only opportunities to make a living, even if it wasn’t much. “In that time, in southern Mexico, there was no work. So we decided to come on board as braceros. They paid a little more money,” said Uvina. “There was more poverty in Mexico.” Uvina said he used to make 50 cents an hour as a bracero, but back then he could live on $5.00 a week. Uvina was brought into the United States through Rio Vista farm in Socorro, Texas. He said he worked on a cotton farm in Socorro for six years until he said he was fired for complaining about cold conditions. From there, Uvina said he went to a farm in California for six months, and then back to Fabens, Texas, for one more year. Now decades after he first arrived to work a temp job, Uvina is an American citizen along with his children and grandchildren.",0
602,"The Center For American Progress (CAP) Action Fund circulated a memo on Monday calling illegal immigrants brought here at a young age — so-called “Dreamers” — a “critical component of the Democratic Party’s future electoral success.” The memo, co-authored by former Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri, was sent around to allies calling on Democrats to “refuse to offer any votes for Republican spending bills that do not offer a fix for Dreamers and instead appropriate funds to deport them.” President Donald Trump’s administration moved to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy in September, which former President Barack Obama instituted through executive order to keep immigrants who came here as children from being deported. Trump called on Congress to find a legislative fix for young immigrants, or “Dreamers,” facing deportation. House lawmakers recently put forward a bipartisan DACA compromise bill that also claims to address worries over chain migration. However, it’s unclear if the bill will pass. CAP Action’s memo says protecting DACA is not only a “moral imperative” for Democrats, it also key to getting votes. “The fight to protect Dreamers is not only a moral imperative, it is also a critical component of the Democratic Party’s future electoral success,” reads Palmieri’s memo, obtained by OutletName News Foundation. “If Democrats don’t try to do everything in their power to defend Dreamers, that will jeopardize Democrats’ electoral chances in 2018 and beyond,” reads the memo. “In short, the next few weeks will tell us a lot about the Democratic Party and its long-term electoral prospects.” OutletName Host Tucker Carlson confronted Center for American Progress senior fellow Henry Fernandez on the memo. CAP Action is the 501(c)(4) political group, a sister group of the think tank where Fernandez is technically employed.",0
951,"There’s a moment in Jeff Ross’s new comedy special where the comedian couldn’t possibly look any more out of place. He’s in the center of a room surrounded by a group of female Eritrean immigrants at a safe house in Austin, Texas. Six of them sleep in the small room. Some are braiding each other’s hair while sharing with Ross the story of their dangerous and life-risking journey to the United States. Ross stands awkwardly in the middle, and it’s clear he’s a comedian disarmed. “Their stories were so compelling, I didn’t want to cloud it with thoughts that weren’t about them,” Ross recalled to OutletName later. “I didn’t want to make jokes in that moment; I didn’t have a joke at that moment.” On it’s own, the immigration debate isn’t something that makes people laugh a lot these days. But, in that, Ross saw an opportunity to dig into the truths of the people whose lives are affected by the policies being talked about by using the sharpest tool at his disposal: his comedy. “If you compare what’s referred to as Fake News with comedy, it can only be called Real Comedy. There’s no faking it in comedy,” he said. “It’s either funny or not funny and funny is always based on truth.” That’s the reason, Ross says, that “woke comedy” or “activist comedy” is on the rise. It’s an opportunity for unfiltered truths, delivered as palatable jokes. Jokes make the truth go down easier, if you will. In the special, which primarily includes footage from his time in Brownsville, Texas, a town on the frontline of the immigration debate, Ross dives into an issue that remains front of mind for many as the Trump administration takes steps to reform U.S. immigration policies. In September, the Trump administration announced the end of DACA – a program that had protected nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation who were brought to the U.S. as children. Trump has also expressed a desire to end the Diversity Visa Lottery program and was elected on a promise to build a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. While researching for the special, Ross looked into many of these programs and admitted to feeling exasperated at times. “I’m a not a lawyer, and imagine if I was some Honduran, teenage, pregnant [immigrant]trying to figure out the American legal system,” he said. “It would be so, so hard.” In his special, Ross speaks to residents of a town that is already home to a wall meant to curtail illegal crossings, law enforcement who are witness to a daily influx of immigrants, and even some people fresh from their journey across the border, including a father-son pair and a pregnant woman. “I don’t go into it with politics, I go into it thinking about the people,” Ross said. “If you keep it on the people, you’re never wrong.” Not all the people he interviewed for the special left Ross at ease, however. At one point, a person who smuggles people across the border, called a coyote, describes to Ross what he does to people who can’t pay him after enlisting his services. “Sometimes, when people don’t pay and stuff, you have to hold them for a little bit,” the man, whose face is hidden, says.

Inside, “I was actually thinking, ‘How the hell do I get out of here alive?’” Ross said. He did, and Ross also emerged from the whole experience with a new outlook on what once seemed like a complicated issue. “It became so simple to me when you actually see how hard it is to get into America, how humiliating it is to come over and how grateful the people were who came over,” he said. “This needs to be taken care of for humanitarian reasons.” “Jeff Ross Roasts the Border: Live from Brownsville, Texas” airs Thursday on Comedy Central.",1
1086,"Usually when the president holds a meeting with key lawmakers of both parties to talk about a major -- and majorly contentious -- issue, the press comes in at the beginning of the gathering for a few minutes. The president and congressional leaders voice commitments to finding solutions blah, blah, blah, the press gets escorted out and the real work begins behind closed doors.
""Usual"" is not how President Donald Trump does things -- any things -- of course. And so, on Tuesday, with the top Republicans and Democrats in Congress gathered around him to try to break the immigration impasse over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and funding for the border wall, Trump let reporters spend 55 minutes in the room as he (and others) talked -- and talked and talked.
It was a remarkable thing -- and a reminder that Trump is either unaware of the rules by which Washington traditionally works or he simply doesn't care. Either way, the 55-minute talk-a-thon -- about immigration and, as is typical for Trump, lots of other things -- produced a number of remarkable lines from the commander in chief.
Below are the 40 that stood out to me.
1. ""We've greatly stiffened, as you know.""
And away we go! (Trump is talking about the border and how his policies have cut down on undocumented immigrants entering the country.)
2. ""They're not giving you their best names, they're giving you people they don't want.""
This Trump riff is on the so-called visa lottery by which the man who murdered eight people by mowing them down with a car on the West Side Highway in New York City entered the country. Trump is right that the New York City terrorist did enter the country under the Diversity Immigration Visa Program. But he's wrong about everything else in his characterization of the program. ""We find no basis for his warning that countries are gaming the lottery system and sending 'the real worst' of their citizens to the US,"" Factcheck.org wrote in December 2017
3. ""I'm appealing to everyone in the room to put the country before party, and to sit down and negotiate and to compromise, and let's see if we can get something done.""
A good line here by Trump, and one that most Americans will respond well to. One caveat: Just before making this call for bipartisanship, he emphasized how there needs to be a wall built along the country's southern border. That's not something Democrats agree with.
4. ""So maybe the press can stay for a little while and a couple of folks can make statements.""
Little did we know...
5. ""It could be a good way of starting, ... I think, starting in the House. Starting in the House.""
Trump still doesn't get that the president tends not to make the calls on where a piece of legislation starts. Members of Congress guard their ability to dictate their own schedules and strategies very closely and hate when the chief executive tries to dictate terms to them. (This is true not just with Trump, but with all presidents in the modern era.)
6. ""At a certain point maybe I'll just lock the doors and I won't let anybody out until they come and agree.""
Laugh if you want -- and Trump was joking -- but this isn't a terrible idea.
7. ""There are so many points of agreement, and lot of it's common sense.""
This is the version of Trump many Republicans -- especially in Congress -- were hoping they elected. A businessman driven by common sense and the bottom line. Someone not beholden to the entrenched partisan ways of the past and, therefore, able to reach out in good faith to solve previously unsolvable problems. The Trump they got -- at least for the vast majority of his first year in office -- isn't that.
8. ""We had wars, right, Lindsey?""
This comment is directed at South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Judge Advocate General and, apparently, someone who knows his military history. (Graham, it's worth noting, is Trump's most regular golf partner -- having played with Trump three times.)
9. ""Normally you wouldn't have a president coming to this meeting. Normally, frankly, you'd have Democrats, Republicans, and maybe nothing would get done.""
Trump is heavily invested in the idea that he is doing things no other president has done. Which, sometimes, is true. And sometimes is not true.
10. ""I hear so much about earmarks, the old earmark system, how there was a great friendliness when you had earmarks.""
Great friendliness. The best.
11. ""Maybe all of you should start thinking about going back to a form of earmarks.""
This is remarkable -- and totally indicative of the seat-of-the-pants approach Trump takes to all things. This, remember, is a meeting ostensibly about immigration -- DACA and the border wall in particular. And also remember that House Republicans did away with earmarks after re-taking the majority in 2010 -- largely at the behest of incoming Speaker John Boehner.
Trump's not wrong that earmarks often greased the skids to get legislation passed. (I've noted that one of the main reasons congressional leaders have such a hard time getting legislation passed is because earmarks are gone and they have no carrot -- or stick -- to incentivize wavering colleagues.) It's just amazing that he's bringing it up right at this moment.
12. ""This system really lends itself to not getting along.""
100% right. But the system Trump is talking about (lack of earmarks) is only part of a broader political reality -- partisan drawing of House districts, outside groups funding ideological extremists -- that add to the inability of the two sides to get along. Or, really, for members of the same party -- but different ideological leanings -- to get along.
13. ""You can say what you want about certain presidents and others, where they all talk about they went out to dinner at night and they all got along, and they passed bills.""
Trump seems nostalgic here for a different kind of politics. It is absolutely true there used to be more cross-party socializing and hobnobbing than there is now. And that Trump, who has turned hobnobbing into an art form, might have prospered more in that prior political world.
14. ""Because our system right now, the way it's set up, will never bring people together.""
He's not wrong.
15. ""I think you should look at a form of earmarks. I see Lindsey nodding very hard 'yes.'""
Good ole Lindsey!
Reminder: Graham, who ran against Trump in the 2016 primary, once said this of the real estate magnate: ""I think he's a kook. I think he's crazy. I think he's unfit for office.""
16. ""I'm not talking about Trump.""
No one goes third person like Trump. Not even Chris Cillizza.
17. ""I remember when I used to go out in Washington and I'd see Democrats having dinner with Republicans and they were best friends and everybody got along.""
OK, this may be stretching things a little. Maybe more than a little.
18. ""We're going to get DACA done. I hope we're going to get DACA done.""
I am going to take that as a definite maybe.
19. ""But maybe you should start bringing back a concept of earmarks, it's going to bring you together.""
Did I mention earmarks? Cause that could be interesting. Solution to all of our problems. Or maybe not.
20. ""The country is doing well in so many ways. But there's such divisiveness.""
What's amazing here is that Trump seems entirely unaware of the role he has played in the country's divisiveness. That's not to say we weren't divided before 2016 -- we were -- but it is to say that Trump exacerbated those divisions for political gain, and continues to do so.
21. ""If we do this properly, DACA, you're not so far away from comprehensive immigration reform and if you want to take it that further step, I'll take the heat, I don't care.""
Hmmmmmm. To be clear: There is no DACA deal yet. But Trump is already promising that when comprehensive immigration reform passes, he will take the political heat. There's some bigly cart-before-the-horse-ism going on here.
22. ""My whole life has been heat. I like heat, in a certain way.""
This is the best quote. On a related note: I've always been more of a cold guy.
23. ""You are somewhat more traditional politicians (than me).""
Leader in the clubhouse for understatement of the year.
24. ""If you want to study earmarks to bring us all together so we all get together and do something, I think you should study it.""
Earmarks, ever heard of it? Government of the future.
25. ""If you want to take it a step further...""
""Can you take me higher?"" -- Creed
26. ""I'm signing it. I mean, I will be signing it.""
To be clear: He's signing it. Doesn't matter what ""it"" is.
27. ""We're going to come up with DACA.""
Um, Republicans haven't signed off on that -- especially with no concessions on border security or wall-building.
28. ""We'll do DACA and we can certainly start comprehensive immigration reform. The following afternoon, OK?""
This seems easy enough! What's that you say? ""Do DACA"" isn't a foolproof way to solve this impasse?
29. ""I don't think it's going to be that complicated.""
Comprehensive immigration reform? Easy peasy!
30. ""That's why we make it a phase two. We do a phase one, which is DACA and security, and we do phase two, which is comprehensive immigration.""
Look. We can't call it ""phase one"" because we already have a ""phase one."" Calling it ""phase two"" is our next best option.
31. ""One of the good things, because of our rhetoric or because of the, you know, my perceived attitude, fewer people are trying to come through.""
It's the rhetoric that's stopping people from coming into the US? Also, what does Trump mean by ""perceived attitude""? Isn't it just his attitude?
32. ""Why play defense on the one-yard line?""
To stop them from scoring a touchdown? I'm spitballing here... (This quote comes from Rep. Henry Cuellar, which I've made an exception and included because it's so good).
33. ""I'd love not to build the wall. But you need the wall.""
I'm not sure Trump would ""love"" not to build the wall.
34. "" You know, you speak to the agents, and I spoke to all of them. I lived with them.""
Um, no he didn't. Live with them, I mean.
35. ""And then we can go to comprehensive later on""
Never go comprehensive early on. Gets you bloated.
36. ""I like to go under-budget, ahead of schedule.""
Same.
37. ""I think my positions are going to be what the people in this room come up with.""
This is the most revealing thing Trump said in the entire 55 minutes. He doesn't have any hard-and-fast views on immigration. Not really. He wants the wall because he promised the base he would get the wall. But, really, he just wants a deal.
38.""If they come to me with things I'm not in love with, I'm going to do it.""
To quote Donald Trump: ""I'm signing it. I mean, I will be signing it.""
39. ""Oprah would be a lot of fun.""
Only Trump would say this about a potential 2020 opponent. He knows, of course, that a race between him and Oprah Winfrey would be the most high-profile campaign in American history. And, yes, he would love that.
40. ""I hope we've given you enough material. That should cover you for about two weeks.""
Oh, you did.",1
1817,"President-elect Donald Trump won after making a series of extreme promises on immigration. He said he would ban Muslims from the country or perhaps create a registry of them, along with making a quick fix of the complicated unauthorized immigration problem by building a massive border wall.
On Tuesday, two of the men Trump chose for top cabinet posts distanced themselves, if not necessarily the entire administration, then from some of those stances. And there was one idea they both flatly rejected: that of a registry for Muslims.
Homeland Security secretary pick and retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly told a Senate committee that he does not “agree with registering people based on [ethnicity] or religion or anything like that” and would not bring back a registry program “unless there was some really compelling reason.” On surveillance he said he doesn’t “think it’s ever appropriate to focus on something like religion as the only factor.”
At a separate Senate committee hearing, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the immigration hardliner Trump hopes to make attorney general, said a Muslim registry “would raise serious constitutional problems” over freedom of religion. He also said he would oppose a ban on Muslims entering the U.S., although not a ban on people from certain majority-Muslim nations.
“I have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious group should be denied admission to the United States,” Sessions told senators.
None of this guarantees that Trump won’t crack down on or discriminate against Muslims as president. He never said his proposed ban on Muslims was a mistake, even if he said it “morphed” into a call for vetting and country-specific blocking. One of Trump’s advisors pushed him to restart the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, or NSEERS ― which President Barack Obama took steps to dismantle. As recently as late December, Trump gave indications that he was still open to a registry for Muslims.
Still, the fact that two of Trump’s cabinet picks are opposed to the idea shows that at the very least, supporting such a policy is considered something of a political liability.
For Sessions, comments on Muslims and immigration were part of a broader set of questions over whether he is biased against minorities, something he tried hard to shake on Tuesday. He didn’t abandon his hawkish immigration positions, but he also tried to put a more positive spin on things. He said he would not object to Trump eliminating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, that helps young undocumented immigrants. He also said Congress should pass legislation to address undocumented immigrants, even though he has repeatedly fought efforts for it to do so.
For Kelly, the comments on Muslims were one of several examples of him taking a more nuanced approach to homeland security and immigration than Trump has. Kelly acknowledged that many of the people apprehended at the southern border are coming from Central America, and that one of the things driving them to leave is violent conditions there. A wall alone won’t solve everything, he said.
Kelly would make no guarantees over what would happen to DACA recipients, but said he “would guess that this category might not be the highest priority for removal.” He indicated there will likely be a level of prioritization for enforcement, and that Dreamers would not be at the top of it. Kelly said he would “keep a very open mind” with regards to whether DACA recipients’ information will be used for deportation purposes, something the current DHS secretary has urged against.
There’s a major problem with reading into Kelly’s remarks: By his own admission, he isn’t really in the loop on immigration policy yet.
“The entire development of immigration policy is ongoing right now in terms of the upcoming administration,” Kelly said at one point in the hearing. “I have not been involved in those discussions.”",1
834,"During his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Donald Trump spoke on the issues of illegal immigration and why more security is needed on the country’s southern border.
“We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens,” Trump said as he gave his 2019 State of the Union address. “Tonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.”
The speech comes as Congress remains divided on how to move forward with border security.
Trump, who made the issue a major campaign platform in 2016, has demanded $5.7 billion in funding to build a 234-mile long wall, citing a need to control crime and illegal immigration. However, Democrats have vehemently opposed the idea, framing it as immoral and a waste of taxpayer dollars.
A select group of 17 Republicans and Democrats from both the Senate and House met last week for the first day of border negotiations. The group, formed after the federal government officially existed the shutdown, is tasked with reaching a long-term compromise. The federal government experienced the longest partial shutdown in U.S. history, with Democrats and Republicans still at odds over the administration’s proposal for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The government will enter a shutdown again if Congress is not able reach a compromise by Feb. 15.
“No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards,” Trump continued in his speech Tuesday night. “Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration: reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime and a depleted social safety net.”
“Not one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border,” the president continued.
Trump went on to cite the success of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, citing their arrests of criminal aliens over the past two years. He then touted his “smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier” proposal his administration sent to Congress. His proposal also includes more enforcement officials, humanitarian assistance, drug detection and eliminating loopholes that can protect child smugglers.
“Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe,” the president concluded in his case for the wall.",0
1706,"“We’re just reacting to a unilateral decision,” said Mr. Figueroa, a top federal migration official in the Mexican state of Baja California.
Since the Trump administration’s announcement of the new asylum policy, Mexican officials have been negotiating with their counterparts in Washington to define the conditions under which they would accept the migrants.
On Monday night, Tonatiuh Guillén López, the commissioner of Mexico’s National Migration Institute, said Mexico would only accept migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras between the ages of 18 and 60. He also said that Mexico would only receive returned asylum seekers through the border crossing that connects Tijuana with San Diego, California.
The returned asylum seekers will be granted special four-month, multiple-entry visas that would allow them to travel to the United States for their court dates and then once again return to Mexico, Mexican officials said. Some of the returnees will already have one-year humanitarian visas which allow them to work and travel freely in the country. Asylum cases in the United States can take years to resolve, yet it remained unclear whether and under what terms the Mexican visas would be extended.
The American policy change applies to some asylum seekers who try to enter the United States at official crossings on the country’s southern border, or are apprehended on American soil after trying to cross illegally. But it will not apply to Mexican asylum seekers who might risk harm if returned to Mexico, the very place where they are claiming fear of persecution as grounds for their asylum claim.
Migrants’ advocates and human rights groups have vociferously criticized the American policy shift, saying Mexico, which is suffering historic levels of violence, is not a safe place to send people who already fear for their lives. In addition, Tijuana and other border towns are already overwhelmed with migrants deported from the United States as well as migrants from Central America and elsewhere seeking to enter the country.",1

519,"The second-ranking Democratic leader in the House is resisting pressure from amnesty advocates to threaten another 2018 budget shutdown.
The leadership resistance will likely keep the illegals’ push for a DACA amnesty demand disconnected from the budget. That disconnect will likely boost President Donald Trump’s chance of getting $1.6 million for border-wall construction in the 2018 omnibus bill, due by March 23.
TheHill.com reported:
“I think the omnibus needs to be considered on its own merits, and then we ought to move ahead on DACA,” [leader Rep. Steny] Hoyer told reporters during his weekly press briefing in the Capitol, referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. That strategy would mark a shift from last month, when Hoyer, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other Democratic leaders had rejected a bipartisan budget agreement because it was not accompanied by a specific commitment from Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to consider legislation salvaging DACA, which President Trump is trying to wind down. The strategy also runs the risk of angering the immigrant rights activists pressing Democrats to use every tool they’ve got to solidify DACA protections … Congress has until March 23 to pass the omnibus spending bill or large parts of the federal government will shut down. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told the GOP conference Tuesday that he’s eyeing a House vote on the package next week — a timeline Hoyer endorsed.
Senate Democrats lost political support during their mid-January filibuster of the federal budget.
The House’s 2018 appropriations bill includes $1.6 billion for the budget wall. A Senate committee has approved a similar amount, but Senate Democrats have not yet approved the funding.
Senate Democrats may try to block the wall funding but would risk another damaging budget shutdown eight months before the 2018 midterms.
The $1.6 billion for 2018 is a different post of money from the $25 billion border-wall fund that Trump has asked Congress to approve. The $1.6 billion should be enough to construct and improve 74 miles of wall, while the $25 billion would fund roughly 700 miles.",0
